Hey guys, Charlie here. Today, I want to talk about something that I think is really important when it comes to interacting with women: never neg a girl about her physical appearance. It's just not cool. Guys can handle that shit (most of the time), but girls can't. It's just not worth it. Another thing to keep in mind is to be careful about where you take a girl on a date. For example, taking her to a strip club is probably not the best idea. Masturbation? Maybe not. Porn? Yes. Last month, I stopped watching porn and beating off altogether due to a hunch that I might've had a porn-induced ED moment. It's been a month since I did either, and I've definitely noticed a difference. Not only am I hornier now, but I'm much more attracted to real girls than I was before. I used to only get hard when I'd see a chick that looked like a pornstar. Now, any girl with a nice bod/face gets me fucking horny. Another tip I have is to use her friends to DHV (demonstrate higher value) you. You already know she's into you, but you have to treat meeting up with her in front of her friends like you're opening a new set. Talk with her friends more than you would with her initially, then once you've won the group over and everyone loves you, shift your attention slowly to her. By the time you've got her friends laughing at all your jokes and interested in all your stories, your value to her will be through the roof. One thing that I've learned is that nothing is good nor bad. Thinking makes it so. So, if a girl says something that seems negative, don't take it personally. For example, if she says, "Cool, let me know when you grow up and figure out what you want," just reply with "Cool, let me know when you grow up and figure out what you want" and go fuck ten more chicks. If she's confusing you and playing games like this, she's not worth the time/effort. Another example of how to handle a negative comment is if a girl says, "Um, you're too fucking short for us. What, you like 5'2"?" You can reply with, "Us? Bitch please, you're not good looking enough for me. I'm here to talk to your friend." Then, when she says, "Oh, I didn't know you guys had requirements. Sorry to bother you sir :)" just walk away. You're calling her out on the stupid statement she made ("You're too fucking short for us") while still appearing nonreactive. Also, calling bitches sir is always fun. When it comes to approaching women, it's important to remember that they are no longer the reason you approach. Your frustration is what the post was about. This is something I was thinking about yesterday. 90% of my AA (approach anxiety) is all outcome-dependence. When AA strikes, it's usually "fuck, I'm not gonna be able to get her number/kiss her/fuck her etc..." Then I thought, "what if I just talk for the sake of talking. I don't even need to get numbers." Totally flipped my mind on me. Another thing to keep in mind is that sometimes, a girl might say no to your invite not because she's not interested in you, but because she has other things going on. For example, she might have work and probably thought you were going for coffee anyways. Personally, I would've knocked her for saying 'go ahead' and made it more clear that I was asking her out, but that's just me. Keep doing you and go for it again in the future. When it comes to using body language, one technique that I've found to be effective is the over-the-shoulder approach. This is where you approach a group of girls from behind and talk to them over your shoulder. It's a great way to show that you're not intimidated by them and that you're confident in yourself. However, in most cases, I never go directly into the set because of how much interest it gives off and how intimidating it looks (i.e 'oh my god, this guy's trying to pick us up'). I usually use over the shoulder or off the side with the look like I'm walking away. Sometimes, you might encounter a girl who seems like she's just being a bitch for the sake of it. For example, I once talked to a set of girls who weren't even attractive (all 6.5 and under). I just wanted to talk to them to keep the momentum going. It's weird; in the beginning of the year, I was none of these things (especially #5). Then I guess I got comfortable. I feel like I need to go on a spiritual journey to figure out what's going on. One thing that I've learned is that it's important to focus on spreading joy everywhere you go. Any dude can spit some lines and call himself a PUA. It takes a man to get other people besides himself feeling special. When it comes to smoking weed, I've found that it can be both a blessing and a curse. For example, someone will be telling me a story, and I'll be zoning out and thinking about cheese on donuts. If I'm at a big event where there's a lot of people, I can smoke well beforehand because A) I do get really calm and B) I know there's a lot of people, so the chances of me fucking up don't matter. In this case, I knew everyone there was one set and the one and ONLY set, so the fear of fucking up got really high. Lesson learned. When it comes to teaching your kids about social interaction, it's important to remember that you want to save them from being jackasses. We were dicks until we matured, and if we can save our sons from being such utter jackasses, we win. Finally, I want to answer a common AMA question: how long did it take for you to get good? Also, what is the biggest realization you had once you started getting good? For me, it took a few years to get good. The biggest realization I had was that inner game and abundance mentality are key. You have to believe in yourself and know that there are plenty of other girls out there. It's not about getting that one girl; it's about having fun and enjoying the process.
