It's no secret that the political opinions of people can shift over time. This is something that has been studied extensively in the field of political analysis and public opinion coursework. One of the most interesting findings in this area is the conclusion that "mass opinion is largely shaped by exposure (via the media) to elite discourse on issues." This means that if the media is controlled by the rich and elite, it is easier for them to shape public opinion to their liking. This is something that has been explored in depth in the documentary Outfoxed, which highlights the talking point-style "journalism" that is prevalent in many news outlets. It's not that people's opinions are necessarily fluid, but rather that they are malleable when subjected to a well-oiled propaganda machine. This is further supported by a study titled Stacked Deck: How the Dominance of Politics by the Affluent & Business Undermines Economic Mobility in America. The study shows a clear rift in the political desires of the rich versus the poor, with the former group having a much greater influence on policy decisions. Of course, it's important to approach these findings with a healthy dose of skepticism. Politicians are notorious for manipulating survey data to suit their own agendas, and income groups can be difficult to define and measure accurately. Additionally, gerrymandering is a major problem that can skew the results of surveys and elections. However, it's hard to deny that there is a significant power imbalance in our political system. The rich and corporations have a disproportionate amount of influence, while the average citizen is left feeling powerless and unheard. This is why it's so important to localize power and give more control to individual communities. When decisions are made at the local level, people have a greater say in the policies that affect their daily lives. This can help to counteract the influence of wealthy elites and ensure that everyone's voice is heard. Of course, this is easier said than done. The federal government has become a focal point for corruption, and it can be difficult to break free from the influence of large corporations and special interest groups. However, there are steps that can be taken to move in the right direction. One potential solution is to adopt a state-owned banking model, which would help to transition away from the large banks that currently dominate the financial sector. Additionally, major corporate businesses that are responsible for major violations of law should be dismantled, with their assets used to pay out their victims and promote small business growth. This may seem like a radical approach, but it's important to remember that the current system is not working for the majority of Americans. The housing crisis, for example, has had virtually no justice in the wake of all the revelations that followed. Making an example of these scheming, thieving corporations would help to restore faith in the economy and promote a more stable, localized economy. Of course, there are those who argue that the government should not interfere in the free market. They claim that the "too big to fail" mentality is a political talking point used to justify leaving these monolithic corporations alone. However, this is a shortsighted view that fails to take into account the long-term consequences of allowing these corporations to continue operating unchecked. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a more equitable society where everyone has a fair shot at success. This means reducing the inequality gap, promoting alternative energy, and reducing our dependence on foreign bankers and corrupt monetary policies. It won't be easy, but it's a goal worth striving for. We need to take a hard look at our political system and make the necessary changes to ensure that it works for everyone, not just the wealthy elite.
