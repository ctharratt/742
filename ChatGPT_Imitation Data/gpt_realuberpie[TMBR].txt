What the hell is happening to our society? I mean, seriously, have you seen the shit that's on the internet these days? It's like a cesspool of depravity and filth. And don't even get me started on the influence it's having on our youth. Now, before you start accusing me of being some kind of Luddite, let me just say that I'm not against technology or progress or anything like that. I mean, I'm not some kind of caveman who thinks we should all go back to living in caves and hunting with spears or anything. But I do think that there are some serious problems with the way the internet is being used these days. For one thing, it's making people stupid. I mean, have you seen some of the shit that people post online? It's like they don't even bother to think before they hit "send". And then there's all the fake news and conspiracy theories and bullshit that people believe just because they read it on some random website. It's like critical thinking has gone out the window. And then there's the porn. Oh my god, the porn. I mean, I'm not a prude or anything, but have you seen some of the stuff that's out there? It's like people are trying to outdo each other with how disgusting and depraved they can be. And don't even get me started on the effect it's having on our youth. Kids these days are being exposed to things that they shouldn't even know exist, let alone be watching. And then there's the social media. It's like people have forgotten how to interact with each other in real life. They're so busy posting selfies and updating their status that they don't even notice the world around them. And don't even get me started on the cyberbullying and the trolling and the general nastiness that seems to be everywhere online. But the thing that really gets me is the way that the internet is being used to spread hate and intolerance. I mean, have you seen some of the shit that people are saying online? It's like they don't even care about the consequences of their words. They're so busy trying to be edgy and controversial that they don't even realize how much harm they're causing. And then there's the way that the internet is being used to spread misinformation and propaganda. It's like people don't even bother to fact-check anymore. They just believe whatever they read online, no matter how ridiculous or untrue it is. And then they go and spread it around, like it's some kind of gospel truth. But the thing that really scares me is the way that the internet is being used to manipulate people. I mean, have you seen some of the targeted advertising and the way that companies are using our personal data to sell us shit? It's like they know us better than we know ourselves. And then there's the way that political campaigns are using the internet to sway public opinion. It's like they're trying to brainwash us or something. And don't even get me started on the way that the internet is being used to track our every move. It's like we're living in some kind of dystopian nightmare. They know where we are, what we're doing, who we're talking to. It's like we're all just rats in a maze, being watched and studied and manipulated. But the thing that really pisses me off is the way that people are defending all of this. They act like it's all just harmless fun, like there's nothing wrong with any of it. They say that we should just embrace the technology and stop being so paranoid. But I'm sorry, I can't just sit back and watch as our society is slowly being destroyed by this shit. So what do we do? I don't know. Maybe we need to start regulating the internet more. Maybe we need to start holding companies accountable for the shit that they're putting out there. Maybe we need to start educating people about the dangers of the internet, and how to use it responsibly. But one thing's for sure: we can't just sit back and do nothing. We need to start taking this seriously, before it's too late. Because if we don't, we're going to wake up one day and realize that we've created a monster that we can't control. And that's a scary thought.
