5x5: A Week in the Life of Charlie It's been a pretty chill week for me, with winter holidays just around the corner. I still need to buy gifts for my family, but I'm not too worried about it. I'm more excited about the fact that my final day of school is in 100 days. It's bittersweet, really. I think I'll miss it, but going to university in a different city will probably be decent too. Music-wise, I've been listening to a lot of different stuff. Even though I don't really like Savas, I have to agree that "Das Urteil" is a pretty dope track. I've also been listening to a lot of instrumental hip-hop, like J Dilla and Kid Cudi's "Man on the Moon." I'm not a huge fan of Cudi's singing voice, but the beats are pretty catchy. I've also been listening to a lot of different albums this week. Some of my favorites include "Doris" by Earl Sweatshirt, "Nowhere" by Ride, and "CLPPNG" by Clipping. I've also been revisiting some old favorites, like Kanye West's "Graduation" and "808s & Heartbreak." In other news, I finally got a car! I'm the first one among my friends to get one, so I'll probably be the designated driver for a while. I'm just glad I won't have to rely on public transportation anymore. And speaking of transportation, I've been without wifi for almost 6 weeks now. It's been driving me insane, not because I have no internet, but rather because of the way Telekom treats its customers. They were supposed to send somebody to check my router, but each time no one was coming, instead they were leaving a message that they rang the door and apparently no one opened. I was at home each time and either me or my dad had to cancel some meeting to be at home and open the door for them. Adding on to that, they are treating customers based on their money. Normal customers are in the lowest tier and they can buy their way up to be "treated" faster. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get it off my mind. On a lighter note, I've been thinking about prom lately. There's this girl I like, but I'm not sure if I should ask her. We're pretty different, but maybe opposites really do attract. I've also been reading a lot of comments on different websites, and it's interesting to see how people react to different things. Some people are really negative, while others are more positive. It's all about perspective, I guess. Overall, it's been a pretty good week for me. I had to write two exams (history and English), but they both went reasonably well. I also went to a friend's birthday party on Friday, and it went pretty well too. Thank god I have autumn holidays now. In conclusion, life is full of ups and downs, but it's important to focus on the positives. Whether it's listening to good music, spending time with friends, or just enjoying the little things in life, there's always something to be grateful for. So take care of yourself, and remember to appreciate the good things in life.
