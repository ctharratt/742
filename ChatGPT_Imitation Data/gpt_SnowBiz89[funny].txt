Hey there, I did some digging and found out that Charlie was right about his 980ti not getting the justice it deserves on dx11. It's a shame, really. But it's great to hear that he found a solution by installing an old copy of Windows 7 ultimate. I mean, who knew that an old operating system could work wonders for gaming? I guess it just goes to show that sometimes, the old ways are the best ways. It's interesting to hear that Charlie has been on Mac for the last 8 years and that this is his first PC build in a long time. I can only imagine how exciting it must be to finally have a gaming PC after all those years. And it's great to hear that he's enjoying Windows 7. I mean, it's a solid operating system that's been around for a while, so it's no surprise that everything works with it, including his old games from the 90s. Now, onto the topic of funny pictorials. I'm not sure where Charlie can find more of them, but I'm sure a quick Google search would yield some results. As for the bacon and beer consumption, well, I can't say I blame him. Sometimes, you just need to indulge in some guilty pleasures, you know? And if it results in more chest hair, well, that's just a bonus. I'm not sure what the reference to "Never going to give you up" is all about, but I'm assuming it's some sort of inside joke. And as for the puffs, well, I have no idea what that's all about either. But hey, to each their own. Moving on to the topic of info graphics, it's interesting to see an info graphic about info graphics. It's like a meta-analysis of sorts. And as for the Helltrain Express, well, that sounds like a ride I wouldn't want to be on. It's a shame to hear that there are empty drawers somewhere, but I'm not sure what that's all about. And as for the trend of lowering cars, well, I'm not sure what the reason behind it is either. Maybe it's just a way for people to show off their cars and stand out from the crowd. I have to agree with Charlie on Olivia Wilde. She's definitely a talented actress, and her looks don't hurt either. And as for the whiskey prices in Ontario and Toronto, well, I can't say I'm surprised. Alcohol prices in general tend to be pretty high in Canada. Now, onto the topic of taxes. It's interesting to hear Charlie's perspective on this. He seems to think that if the government keeps taxing the richest people more, it will stifle innovation and creativity. I'm not sure I agree with that, but I can see where he's coming from. And as for the argument about Canada's income tax system, well, it's true that the highest income earners are taxed more heavily in Canada. But that doesn't necessarily mean that everyone else is taxed less. It's a complex issue, and one that's difficult to fully understand. It's great to hear that the best health care in the world is in America and specific locations in Europe. I mean, it's always good to have access to top-notch medical care. And as for the argument about taxes, well, it's true that nothing is truly free. But I think most people would agree that having access to health care is worth paying for. Now, onto the topic of college degrees. Charlie seems to think that if you're not studying something that earns respect and a high average salary, you're doing it wrong. While I can see where he's coming from, I don't necessarily agree with him. I think it's important to study something that you're passionate about, even if it doesn't necessarily lead to a high-paying job. Of course, it's also important to be realistic about your job prospects and to have a plan for how you're going to pay off your student loans. It's interesting to hear Charlie's perspective on liberal arts majors. He seems to think that they're all working at Starbucks, while tech majors are working at places like Deloitte, Accenture, and IBM. While I'm sure there are some liberal arts majors who are struggling to find work, I don't think it's fair to generalize like that. And as for the advice to "study the shit that makes money," well, I think that's a bit simplistic. There are plenty of high-paying jobs out there that don't necessarily require a degree in science, math, business, or medicine. Overall, it's clear that Charlie has some strong opinions on a variety of topics. While I don't necessarily agree with everything he says, I can appreciate his passion and his willingness to speak his mind. And who knows, maybe he's onto something with that old copy of Windows 7 ultimate. Maybe it's time to dust off my old PC and give it a try.
