What could you possibly say negative about someone who goes alone? I mean, seriously, what's wrong with enjoying your own company and doing things solo? I don't get why people have such a problem with it. I love going to the movies alone. I can sit wherever I want, I don't have to share my popcorn, and I can fully immerse myself in the film without any distractions. And let's be real, you shouldn't be talking during a movie anyways, so who cares if you're alone or with a group? But apparently, some people have a problem with it. They think it's weird or sad or whatever. But to each their own, right? I mean, I don't judge people for going to the movies with their friends or significant others. It's just not my thing. And that's okay. Speaking of movies, have you heard about the Miles Davis biopic that's been in the works for years? Apparently, it's having a hard time getting financed because people don't think enough of the world will care about Miles Davis. But I happen to be obsessed with his music, so I don't count. And movies with black casts are financed all the time, so what's the problem here? And don't even get me started on the whole "high degree of accomplishment" argument. I mean, sure, there are objective facts to effective film making, but that doesn't mean everyone has to like the same movies or directors. Christopher Nolan may be one of the premier directors of our time, but that doesn't mean everyone has to love his movies. And it's totally weird and kinda nonsensical to assume that people are dismissing a movie just because they don't like it. There could be a million reasons why someone doesn't like a movie, and it doesn't necessarily mean they're wrong or stupid or whatever. But apparently, some people think that if you don't like a certain movie or director, you're just not smart enough to understand it. That's such bullshit. There are plenty of movies and directors that I don't like, but that doesn't mean I'm not intelligent or cultured or whatever. It just means I have different tastes and preferences. And speaking of tastes and preferences, have you seen the trailer for that new jungle movie? It looks visually stunning, and the voices are amazing. I'm so excited to see it. And I don't care if it's a comic book premise or whatever. It looks like it's going to be a great movie. But of course, there are always going to be people who find ways to hate on things that other people like. It's like they get some kind of sick pleasure out of it or something. And it's especially frustrating when they try to make it about some kind of social justice issue. Like, just because a movie doesn't have a certain type of character or representation doesn't mean it's automatically bad or offensive or whatever. And just because someone likes a certain movie or director doesn't mean they're racist or sexist or whatever. I mean, come on. Can't we just enjoy things without having to constantly analyze them and find fault with them? Can't we just appreciate art for what it is, without having to make it about politics or social justice or whatever? I know I can. And I'm sure there are plenty of other people out there who feel the same way. So let's just enjoy our movies, our music, our art, and our lives, without having to constantly judge and criticize each other. Let's embrace our differences and our individuality, and celebrate the things that make us unique. Because at the end of the day, that's what really matters.
