Wow, I couldn't agree more with Charlie's point about protecting against speculators in battles. It's a real problem in many competitive games, and it's great to see developers taking steps to prevent it. For those who may not be familiar with the term, a speculator is someone who intentionally loses a battle in order to gain an advantage. This can happen in a variety of ways, but the most common is when a player intentionally quits a battle they know they're going to lose. By doing so, they can avoid losing as many points as they would if they stayed in the battle and fought to the end. This may not seem like a big deal, but it can have a significant impact on the game's balance. If enough players start speculating, it can create a situation where the game's ranking system becomes meaningless. Players who are actually skilled at the game may find themselves ranked lower than they should be, while players who are simply good at speculating may find themselves ranked higher than they deserve. To combat this problem, many game developers have implemented systems that penalize players who quit battles early. For example, some games will deduct points from a player's ranking if they quit a battle before it's over. Others may impose a temporary ban on players who quit too many battles in a row. These systems are designed to discourage speculators from quitting battles early, and they seem to be working. In games where these systems are in place, speculating is much less common than it used to be. Players are more likely to stick it out and fight to the end, even if they know they're going to lose. Of course, there are still some players who will try to speculate no matter what. These players are often referred to as "rage quitters," because they quit battles out of frustration rather than strategy. They may quit a battle because they're losing badly, or because they don't like the way their opponent is playing. While rage quitting is a problem, it's not as big of a problem as speculating. Most players who rage quit do so infrequently, and they're not doing it to gain an advantage. They're simply frustrated and want to move on to the next battle. That being said, there are still some game developers who are taking steps to discourage rage quitting as well. For example, some games will impose a temporary ban on players who quit too many battles in a row, even if they're not speculating. This is designed to encourage players to stick it out and fight to the end, even if they're not doing well. Overall, I think it's great to see game developers taking steps to protect against speculators and rage quitters. These players can really disrupt the balance of a game, and they can make it less fun for everyone else. By penalizing these players and encouraging everyone to play fair, game developers are helping to create a more enjoyable and competitive gaming experience for everyone.
