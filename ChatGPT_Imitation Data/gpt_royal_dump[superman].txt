Oh man, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. What a movie. I remember when it was first announced and everyone was losing their minds. The idea of seeing two of the biggest superheroes of all time on the big screen together was just too much for some people to handle. And then the trailers started coming out, and people were even more excited. But then the movie actually came out, and...well, let's just say it didn't quite live up to the hype. Don't get me wrong, there were definitely some cool moments in the movie. Seeing Batman and Superman fight was pretty epic, and Wonder Woman's entrance was amazing. But overall, the movie just felt kind of...messy. There were too many characters and too many plotlines, and it all just kind of got jumbled together in a way that didn't really work. One of the biggest criticisms of the movie was the portrayal of Superman. A lot of people felt like he was too brooding and angsty, and that he didn't really feel like the Superman they knew and loved. And I have to admit, I kind of agree with that. Superman is supposed to be a symbol of hope and optimism, but in this movie he just felt kind of...depressed. But you know what? I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I mean, think about it. Superman is an alien who came to Earth and was raised by humans. He's always going to feel like an outsider, like he doesn't quite belong. And on top of that, he's constantly being put in these impossible situations where he has to choose between doing what's right and doing what's easy. That's a lot of pressure for anyone to handle, let alone someone who's essentially a god. So yeah, I can see why Superman might be feeling a little down in this movie. And honestly, I kind of appreciate that they went in that direction. It's a more nuanced take on the character than we usually see, and it makes him feel more human (ironically enough). Of course, that's not to say that the movie was perfect. There were definitely some missteps along the way. One of the biggest ones, in my opinion, was the way they handled the death of Superman. Now, I know that's a big storyline from the comics, and I can see why they wanted to include it in the movie. But the way they did it just felt...rushed. Like they were trying to cram too much into one movie and didn't really have time to give the storyline the weight it deserved. And then there's the whole Martha thing. I mean, come on. I get what they were going for with that scene, but the execution was just...not great. It felt like a cheap way to get Batman to stop fighting Superman, and it didn't really make a lot of sense in the context of the movie. But you know what? Despite all of that, I still kind of love this movie. It's not perfect, but it's ambitious and it's trying to do something different with these characters. And honestly, I think that's worth celebrating. Plus, it gave us Wonder Woman. And let's be real, she was the best part of the whole thing. Gal Gadot absolutely killed it in that role, and I'm so glad that she's gone on to have her own successful movie franchise. All in all, I think Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a flawed but fascinating movie. It's not for everyone, but if you're a fan of these characters and you're willing to give it a chance, there's a lot to appreciate here. And who knows? Maybe someday we'll look back on it as a misunderstood masterpiece. Or maybe not. But either way, it's definitely worth a watch.
