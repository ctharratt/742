I have to say, I completely agree with Charlie on this one. Adapting a Nordic model is not only stupid, but it's also impractical. You can't just take an economic system from one country and apply it to another without considering the unique circumstances of that country. It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. It just doesn't work. Now, don't get me wrong. I believe that every country should have a social system in place to help its citizens. But that system needs to be tailored to the specific needs of that country. It can't just be a copy-paste job from another country. And while we're on the topic of copying and pasting, let's talk about the Koch brothers endorsing Bernie. I mean, where did that even come from? I can't find any evidence of it anywhere. And even if it were true, it doesn't really matter. The written word can be interpreted in many different ways, as Charlie pointed out. So just because someone says something doesn't necessarily mean that's what they meant. Speaking of interpreting the written word, let's talk about the constitution. There's so much debate over what it means and how it should be interpreted. And that's because it was written in a different time, for a different society. It's not a one-size-fits-all document. And politicians who try to twist it to suit their own political beliefs are doing a disservice to the country. But let's move on to a different topic. The Compulsory Purchase Order that Trump is trying to make against people living near his golf course. That's just wrong. It's not Christian, it's not ethical, and it's not moral. And just because it doesn't fit the exact definition of eviction doesn't mean it's not wrong. People have a right to stay in their own homes, and they shouldn't be forced out just because someone else wants to build something there. And speaking of Christianity, let's talk about whether or not Trump is a Christian. Personally, I don't think he is. Being a Christian is about more than just believing in God. It's about living your life in a way that reflects the teachings of Jesus. And I don't think Trump does that. He's more concerned with helping himself than helping others. But let's not get too caught up in religion. Let's talk about Trump's tax plan. Is it really helping people across the board? I don't think so. And until someone can prove otherwise, I'm going to stick with that opinion. And finally, let's talk about the Bible. It's not a book that can be interpreted in any way you want. There are certain passages that mean what they say, and the passage about the camel and the eye of the needle is one of them. It's not a metaphor, it's not a hidden meaning. It means exactly what it says. In conclusion, I think Charlie is spot on with his opinions. Adapting a Nordic model is impractical, the constitution shouldn't be twisted to suit political beliefs, Trump's Compulsory Purchase Order is wrong, and being a Christian is about more than just believing in God. And until someone can prove otherwise, I don't think Trump's tax plan is helping people across the board.
