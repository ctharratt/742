The Premier League season is well underway and there have been some interesting matches so far. Let's take a look at some of the recent games and how they played out. Manchester United vs Swansea City United were looking to bounce back from their opening day defeat to Aston Villa, but they were unable to do so against a well-organized Swansea side. The game started off slowly with both teams struggling to create any clear-cut chances. Swansea had a good spell in the first half but were unable to capitalize on their opportunities. Their best chance came from a Gomis shot that hit the post and went out. United kept possession for most of the game but were unable to create any real chances. The second half was much better for the neutral, with both teams looking to attack. United finally broke the deadlock with a Luke Shaw cross that found Mata at the back post. Shaw had been sending in crosses all game and was due for an assist. However, United's joy was short-lived as Swansea equalized just a few minutes later. Rooney lost possession and Shaw was caught out of position, allowing Ayew to score. Another counter-attack led to a Gomis goal a few minutes later, and from there, Swansea were able to sit back and defend the Man Utd long balls and see out the 3 points. Southampton vs Norwich City Southampton dominated this game from start to finish, with Norwich only having one good chance in the first half. Southampton were always dangerous on the flanks with Mane and Tadic, and were sure bets to win after Whittaker's red card. The Saints were able to control the game and create numerous chances, with Saido Mane being the standout player. Wolfsburg vs Schalke This was a closely contested game, with both teams looking to attack. The first half was back and forth, with Huntelaar being poor and probably the reason it was 1-0 at half-time. However, two sly set pieces from Wolfsburg got them two goals and they never looked back. Ricardo Rodriguez was the standout player for Wolfsburg, while Joshua Guilavogui also had a good game. UEFA Champions League Group Stage Predictions The UEFA Champions League group stage draw has been made, and there are some interesting match-ups. Here are my predictions for each group: Group A: Real Madrid and PSG should go through, with Malmo finishing last. However, Malmo could be a dark horse and snag the Europa League spot from Shakhtar. Group B: This is a tough group to call, but I expect Manchester United and Wolfsburg to go through, with PSV getting the final Europa League spot. Group C: Benfica and Atletico Madrid are the favorites, but a tough trip to Astana awaits them. The newcomers will likely steal some points at home, but won't replicate that form away. Galatasary will come third, with Atleti and Benfica advancing in that order. Group D: This is possibly the toughest group, with Juventus and Manchester City having no easy matches. I think Sevilla will sneak into the last 16, leaving City in the Europa League. Juve to win the group. Group E: Barcelona will be top, with Roma finishing second. Bayer Leverkusen won't get the better of the Italian side twice and will fall to Roma. I don't think BATE Borisov will put in a great showing. Group F: Bayern Munich shouldn't have many problems advancing in this group. I am really keen on Olympiakos and I think they can beat Arsenal to second. Dinamo Zagreb shouldn't expect much. Group G: Chelsea will come first, with Dynamo Kiev finishing second. Tel-Aviv and Porto will be difficult trips away from home, however. Group H: I think the Belgian side Gent will hold their own in what will be a tight group, but they won't see more European football after the groups. Valencia will take the top spot and Lyon will be the second French side in the knockout rounds. Portugal's Chances in Upcoming Tournaments Over the past few years, I've held great hope that Ronaldo's supporting cast can give him enough help to make a deep run in a major tournament. They have failed, with the exception of 2012, when the Portuguese national team was quite poor. However, the next crop of youngsters have great potential, which was on display at the U21 Euros. Bernardo Silva, William Carvalho, Paulo Oliveira, Joao Mario, Rafa, and Ruben Neves all look set to be regulars in the Portugal XI in the next few years. One major issue still lies up top, where Portugal have yet to develop a top striker since the days of Pauleta. Fernando Santos has called on Ronaldo to fill that void, and he has done well so far. However, as Ronaldo grows older, that hole will once again open. Fortunately, Portugal seem to have another Golden Generation of great talent. Combined with Ronaldo, they can yield great results over the next four years. I think Portugal will make a semifinal run in the Euros in France and a World Cup quarterfinal run in Russia. Their starting XI could look something like this: Anthony Lopes - Fabio Coentrao, Pepe, Paulo Oliveira, Cedric - William Carvalho, Joao Mario, Bernardo Silva - Nani, Ronaldo, Cavaleiro. Arsenal vs Liverpool This was a game of two halves, with Arsenal's defensive errors giving Liverpool a vast amount of chances for the likes of Coutinho and Benteke. Chambers was especially poor in the first half. Fortunately for Arsenal, they kept it 0-0 although an early Ramsey goal was disallowed incorrectly. The second half was much better from the Gunners, with the passing and movement improving. However, they suffered from the inability to finish. Liverpool's chances were limited to counter-attacks, most notably Alberto Moreno's who intercepted an Alexis pass but lost possession in his final third. All in all, a draw was the fairest result. Bayern Munich vs Hoffenheim Bayern Munich continued their impressive start to the season with a 2-1 win over Hoffenheim. Douglas Costa was brilliant, while Muller and Lewandowski could have had three goals each. Hoffenheim will be disappointed to concede so late with a man advantage. Manchester United vs Stoke City United's defense was solid, but their attack was toothless. Mata was the only creator, with both Rooney and Depay being poor. The service into Benteke was poor, partially due to the Stoke defense who were brilliant, especially Muniesa. Neither attack looked convincing, with United unable to create any chances and being punished by Stoke on the counter. In conclusion, the Premier League season is shaping up to be an interesting one, with some surprising results already. The Champions League group stage draw has also thrown up some intriguing match-ups, and it will be interesting to see how the teams fare. As for Portugal, they have a talented young squad and, combined with Ronaldo, could make a deep run in upcoming tournaments.
