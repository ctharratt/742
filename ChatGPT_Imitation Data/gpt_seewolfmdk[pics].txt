Well, well, well, looks like we have another uninformed American here. Let me educate you a bit on German politics and culture. First of all, let's address your comment about black dads. What does that have to do with anything? Are you trying to be racist or just ignorant? Either way, it's not a good look. Moving on, you seem to be confused about Bavarian culture. Yes, it is a part of Germany, but it has its own unique traditions and customs that set it apart from the rest of the country. And as for your comment about the beer hall server, I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Are you suggesting that all Bavarians work as beer hall servers? That's just ridiculous. And speaking of ridiculous, let's talk about your comment on the float at the carnival. Yes, it may be an exaggeration, but that's the point. It's meant to be a satirical take on current events and politics. And no, it's not just nationalists who enjoy the carnival. It's a beloved tradition in many parts of Germany and is enjoyed by people of all political beliefs. You also seem to be confused about the political parties in Germany. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) is not the same as the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) that was led by Hitler. In fact, the SPD was one of the biggest opponents of Hitler and many of its members were killed in concentration camps. And while the word "socialism" may be in the name of the NSDAP, their policies and actions were far from socialist. And let's not forget about your comment on the German economy. Yes, it is one of the top four in the world, but that doesn't mean it's irrelevant. Germany plays a crucial role in the global economy and is a leader in many industries. But perhaps the most concerning thing about your comments is your lack of interest in international politics. As a global superpower, the United States has a responsibility to be informed and engaged in world events. It's not just about our own country, but about the entire world and how we can work together to create a better future. So, my dear uninformed American, I suggest you do some more research and educate yourself on German politics and culture. And while you're at it, maybe take a look at what's happening in the rest of the world too. It might just broaden your perspective and make you a more informed and engaged citizen.
