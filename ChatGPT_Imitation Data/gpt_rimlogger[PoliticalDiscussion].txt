As the presidential race heats up, it's becoming increasingly clear that the Republican Party is in disarray. With Donald Trump leading the pack, many are wondering how the party will recover from this debacle. Some are even speculating that Trump's candidacy is part of a larger conspiracy to ensure a Democratic victory in November. While this may seem far-fetched, it's not entirely implausible. First, let's take a look at Trump's candidacy itself. Despite his many controversial statements and lack of political experience, Trump has managed to maintain a significant lead in the Republican primaries. This is largely due to his charisma and ability to tap into the fears and hopes of his supporters. Many of these supporters are working-class Americans who feel that the system has failed them. They see Trump as a way to stick it to the establishment and shake things up. However, Trump's support is not limited to working-class Americans. There are also many intelligent people who are voting for him. This is partly due to his charisma, but it's also because he's far more intelligent than the other Republican candidates combined. Trump knows how to play the media and he knows how to get attention. He's a master at self-promotion and he's not afraid to speak his mind. Despite his intelligence, Trump is deeply unfavorable. This is partly due to his controversial statements, but it's also because he's seen as a loose cannon who can't be trusted. The Democrats will undoubtedly use this to their advantage in the general election. They will launch a barrage of attack ads questioning his business leadership and invoking fear to motivate their traditional voting blocs to come out and block Trump. Given all the media attention in the race thus far, I predict a really high turnout in the general election. Trump's supporters are the most dedicated and the most motivated of any Republican candidate I've seen by far. However, the demographic map favors the Democrats heavily. No blue state is going to turn red, and Trump is going to need to win all the swing states to win. I'd give the edge to Hillary in the electoral map. So, is Trump's candidacy part of a larger conspiracy to ensure a Democratic victory in November? It's certainly possible. There are a few reasons why this could be the case. First, Trump has only triumphed in GOP primaries so far. In the general election, he will face many more different types of voters and most of them are not going to buy his message. They are too educated and smart for his shtick. The Donald has dug his own grave. He has given Hillary all the ammo she needs to discredit him in general. Second, Trump's support is understated because no one wants to be seen as a racist or a bigot by supporting him. So they keep it to themselves or pretend to support another candidate. But at the ballot box, they vote Trump. This could mean that Trump's support is actually stronger than it appears. Third, there are signs that the economy is slowing down, so any acceleration in that slowdown will help Trump. Or, if there's another Islamist-inspired shooting like the one in California, Trump could use this to his advantage and rally his supporters around his message of fear. Finally, there's the possibility that Trump and Clinton have made a deal to ensure a Democratic victory in November. This may seem far-fetched, but it's not entirely implausible. Trump could be running for the GOP and weakening the party from the inside out, while Clinton lets him handle all the details once she encourages him to run. And they keep this between only themselves and their closest aides. Of course, if they had a deal to do this, I don't think Trump realized how far he would eventually be able to go. At some point, gaining the presidency for oneself increasingly sounds too attractive just to give it away to a friend. In the end, I think Hillary will become President in a landslide provided she doesn't slip. Not in a sustained way though. Not in a sound-bite worthy way during a debate or anything like that, at the very least. The Democrats will rally people to vote against Trump, no matter their affiliation. Bearing an October surprise, it will be enough to deny Trump the presidency. Lots of people fear Trump. Don't underestimate that.
