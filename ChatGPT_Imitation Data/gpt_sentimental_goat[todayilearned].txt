Maybe it's just me, but I feel like there's something to be said about the competitive nature of men. It's like we're wired to always be in competition with each other, even if it's subconscious. I mean, did they talk about this during orientation? Because it seems like a lot of people don't even realize they're doing it. Take for example the recent study on walking and creativity. So many people read the title and assumed that walking was better for all types of thinking, when in reality it only had a positive effect on creative brainstorming. And even then, those who responded while walking performed mildly worse than those who responded while sitting for a word-association task. But what really caught my attention was the fact that the study only mentioned the outcome for those who were walking or sitting indoors or outdoors, but didn't mention anything about the outcome for those who were in a wheelchair. Did I miss something? It seems like an important detail to leave out. Speaking of important details, did you know that lack of a functioning gene is what causes some people to not produce body odor? And yet, 75% of those people still use deodorant. It's like they don't even know they don't need it. But the gene in question codes for a pump that might be involved in the secretion of odor-producing precursor molecules, which are then metabolized by bacteria to produce the odor. The same gene may also be functional in glands that produce ear wax, which might explain the different quality of ear wax in some people. But let's switch gears for a moment and talk about Audie Murphy. This guy was a true hero, receiving the Medal of Honor at the age of 19 for single-handedly holding off an entire company of German soldiers for an hour, then leading a successful counterattack while wounded and out of ammunition. And yet, in the last few years of his life, he was plagued by money problems but refused offers to appear in alcohol and cigarette commercials because he didn't want to set a bad example. That's the kind of character we should all strive for. And speaking of character, did you hear about the nurse who violated HIPAA laws and caused someone to lose their career? That's just unacceptable. If you can prove they violated HIPAA laws, they might owe you a handsome amount of cash. It's important to stand up for yourself and your rights. But let's end on a lighter note and talk about cars. They're fascinating, aren't they? You can travel hundreds of miles in just a few hours, all while sitting in your own comfortable cocoon. It's like your own little world on wheels. And speaking of wheels, did you hear about the guy who spent $40,650 to book all the seats in two Beijing IMAX cinemas screening Transformers 4 to show his ex-girlfriend that she was wrong to leave him? That's some dedication right there. Overall, it's important to pay attention to the details and not make assumptions based on titles or headlines. And it's also important to stand up for yourself and your rights, whether it's in the workplace or in your personal life. And if all else fails, take a walk and let your creative juices flow.
