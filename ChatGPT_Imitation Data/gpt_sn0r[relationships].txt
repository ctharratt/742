Well, well, well, it seems like we have quite the situation on our hands. From addiction to relationships to workplace harassment, there's a lot to unpack here. But fear not, my dear reader, for I, Charlie, am here to offer my two cents on each of these issues. Let's start with the addiction. It's concerning that your girlfriend thinks it's okay to intentionally hurt each other in a relationship. That's not healthy behavior, and it's definitely a red flag. A good relationship is built on trust, respect, and communication, not on hurting each other. And while I understand that you're in love, it's important to recognize when something isn't right and address it before it becomes a bigger problem. Now, onto the financial situation. It's great that you're good with money, but it's not fair for your girlfriend to expect you to foot the bill for everything. It's important to have open and honest conversations about finances in a relationship, and to find a way to split expenses fairly. Going Dutch on more than just basic bills is a great idea, and it's important to make your partner feel like a stakeholder in the relationship at all levels. As for the showering situation, I have to say that I agree with the other commenters. At seven years old, it's perfectly normal for a child to shower with their mother or bathe with their sibling. It's important to educate yourself about child development and body image, and to not make a big deal out of something that's perfectly normal. Moving on to the workplace harassment, it's unacceptable for your boss to call your wife incompetent and lazy. That's a hostile work environment, and it's important to document any instances of harassment and report them to HR. While it may be too late to do anything about it since your boss is retiring soon, it's still important to keep a record of any incidents in case they escalate in the future. And finally, the roommate situation. It sounds like your roommate is a bit of a nightmare, to be honest. Refusing to shower or cut his hair is one thing, but buying three dogs when he knows you're allergic is just plain inconsiderate. And setting your rollerblades on fire? That's just bizarre. It's important to have open and honest communication with your roommate about your concerns, and to set boundaries if necessary. If he's unwilling to compromise or respect your needs, it may be time to consider finding a new living situation. In conclusion, it's important to recognize when something isn't right in a relationship, workplace, or living situation, and to address it before it becomes a bigger problem. Communication, respect, and compromise are key to building healthy relationships and environments. And if all else fails, there's always the option of setting your rollerblades on fire. Just kidding, don't do that.
