Milwaukee has a rich history when it comes to movie theaters. From the old Westlane on Hwy100 to the recently built Majestic, the city has seen its fair share of theaters come and go. However, one area that has been underserved for many years is the Southridge area. With most of the theaters closing down, the closest option for new movies was either on 13th street or Mooreland Rd. There were closer budget options, but for those looking for a more upscale experience, the options were limited. The Southridge area has been in need of a new theater for quite some time now. The area is home to a large population, and yet there are no theaters nearby. This is why the announcement of a new Marcus theater in the area was met with excitement. However, there are concerns about how the theater will be executed. The Mayfair movie theater is an example of how a theater can become a magnet for trouble if not done right. The area around the theater is often congested, and the experience inside the theater is not always pleasant. The theater is often crowded, and the quality of the experience is not always up to par. This is why it is important for the new theater in the Southridge area to be done right. The theater needs to be a Majestic-type movie theater with restaurants and other amenities. This will not only attract moviegoers but also provide a unique experience that will keep them coming back. The theater needs to be a destination, not just a place to see a movie. If done right, it could be an asset to the surrounding community. However, there are concerns about the location of the theater. Geographically speaking, the theater is quite far away from the Southridge area. This could be a problem for those who live in the area and want to see a movie. The theater needs to be easily accessible, and the location needs to be convenient for those who live nearby. One option could be to build the theater closer to the Southridge area. This would make it more convenient for those who live in the area and would also attract more people to the theater. However, this would require finding a suitable location, which could be difficult. Another option could be to provide transportation to the theater. This could be in the form of a shuttle service or public transportation. This would make it easier for those who live in the area to get to the theater and would also attract more people to the area. Regardless of the location, the theater needs to be a unique experience. It needs to offer something that other theaters in the area do not. This could be in the form of a unique menu or a special seating arrangement. Whatever it is, it needs to be something that will keep people coming back. In addition to the new theater, there are many other things to do in Milwaukee. The city has a rich history and is home to many attractions. One of the best places to visit is the Public Market. This is a great place to go, especially if it's going to be cold out. When you are done walking around inside, you can walk around the Third Ward. The Third Ward is a trendy area that is home to many shops and restaurants. Another great place to visit is the Lost Dogs of Wisconsin. This organization provides free fliers that you can post to social media and also print out and place outside. If you know the general direction the dog went, knock on a few doors in the subdivision to find out if they have a private fb group they can post to for you. Milwaukee is also home to many hiking trails. The Wisconsin Go Hiking Club has a hike almost every single day. This is a great way to get out and explore the city. The city is also home to many book clubs. These book clubs are a great way to meet new people and discuss your favorite books. If you are looking for a place to live in Milwaukee, there are many options available. The East Side, Lower East Side, and Third Ward areas are all great places to live. These areas are trendy and offer many amenities. However, if you are looking for a more affordable option, there are many other areas to consider. When it comes to condos, they are not always a better investment. Many condo developments went into foreclosure within the last 9 years. There are many people that bought "high-end" condos that have ended up selling them for several hundred thousand dollars less than they paid. Others have chosen to rent/lease them because they can't sell them for what they bought them for. In conclusion, the new Marcus theater in the Southridge area has the potential to be a great addition to the community. However, it needs to be done right. The theater needs to be a unique experience that will keep people coming back. It needs to be easily accessible and convenient for those who live in the area. If done right, it could be an asset to the surrounding community.
