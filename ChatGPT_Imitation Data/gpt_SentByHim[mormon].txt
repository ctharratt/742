Well, well, well, it seems we have another skeptic in our midst. I can't say I'm surprised, as there are always those who refuse to see the truth that is right in front of them. But fear not, my friend, for I am here to enlighten you on the reality of God's existence. Firstly, let's address the issue of political leanings. It's quite amusing to me that some people believe that being a liberal around Mormons is like being the skinniest kid at fat camp. I mean, come on, can we not have differing political beliefs and still coexist peacefully? It's not like our political affiliations define who we are as individuals. And to be honest, no one has ever asked me about my political leanings either. It's just not that important in the grand scheme of things. Now, onto the topic of God's existence. I find it quite baffling that some people refuse to believe in something that is so clearly evident all around us. It's like trying to deny the existence of air or water. Just because we can't see it, doesn't mean it's not there. In fact, there is overwhelming evidence of God's existence if we just take the time to look for it. Let's start with the concept of love. As 1 John 4:8 states, "God is love." Love is a universal language that transcends all boundaries and is present in every culture and society. It's the driving force behind acts of kindness, compassion, and selflessness. When we see someone performing a selfless act, we are witnessing the love of God being expressed through them. Furthermore, the absence of love is what we refer to as evil. Evil is not a tangible thing, but rather the absence of something that should be there. Just like cold is the absence of heat and dark is the absence of light, evil is the absence of love. And just like a small light can overcome the deepest darkness, the love of God can overcome even the most evil of acts. The presence of God can also be measured by the fruits of the Holy Spirit, as outlined in Galatians 5:22-23. These fruits include love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. When we see these attributes being expressed in someone's life, we are witnessing the presence of God. But what about those who claim to have never experienced God's presence? Well, just because someone hasn't experienced something doesn't mean it's not real. For example, there are many things that we can't see or hear, but we know they exist because of the evidence around us. The same is true for God's existence. Just because someone hasn't experienced God's presence doesn't mean that He's not there. And let's not forget about the countless testimonies of people who have experienced God's presence in their lives. These are not just isolated incidents, but rather a common occurrence among believers. It's hard to deny the existence of something when so many people have experienced it firsthand. Now, I know there are those who will argue that God can't be seen, heard, felt, smelled, or measured in any way. But that's simply not true. People have seen God, felt His presence, heard His voice, and even smelled Him. These are all experiences that cannot be quantified, but they are real nonetheless. And let's not forget about the impact that God has had on the world throughout history. The countless lives that have been transformed by His love and grace, the miracles that have occurred, and the countless acts of kindness and compassion that have been performed in His name. These are all evidence of God's existence and His impact on the world. In conclusion, the evidence of God's existence is all around us if we just take the time to look for it. Love, the absence of evil, the fruits of the Holy Spirit, countless testimonies, and the impact on the world are all evidence of His existence. So, my friend, I urge you to open your eyes and see the truth that is right in front of you. Don't be blinded by your skepticism, but rather embrace the reality of God's existence and the impact He can have on your life.
