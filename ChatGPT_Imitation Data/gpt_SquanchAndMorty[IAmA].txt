Hey there! I see you have some questions about getting a pilot's degree in Canada. Well, let me tell you, it's not a simple answer. The length of time it takes to get a pilot's degree in Canada can vary depending on a few factors. Firstly, it depends on the type of pilot's license you want to obtain. There are three main types of pilot's licenses in Canada: the Private Pilot License (PPL), the Commercial Pilot License (CPL), and the Airline Transport Pilot License (ATPL). The PPL is the most basic license and allows you to fly for personal reasons, while the CPL and ATPL allow you to fly commercially. The PPL typically takes around 6-12 months to complete, while the CPL can take anywhere from 12-18 months. The ATPL is the most advanced license and can take up to 2 years to complete. However, it's important to note that these timeframes can vary depending on the individual's pace of learning and the flight school they attend. Another factor that can affect the length of time it takes to get a pilot's degree in Canada is the type of aircraft you want to fly. There are different categories of aircraft, such as single-engine, multi-engine, and helicopters. Each category requires a different type of license and training, which can affect the length of time it takes to complete. As for the planes themselves, they can be either original or reproductions. Many flight schools use modern aircraft, such as Cessnas and Pipers, which are original planes. However, some flight schools may use older planes that have been restored or rebuilt, which could be considered reproductions. Now, onto your question about customers thinking we're trying to scam them. I have to say, it's not a common occurrence, but it has happened before. In those situations, our plan is always to be transparent and honest with the customer. We explain our pricing and services in detail and answer any questions they may have. If they still feel uneasy, we encourage them to do their own research and compare our prices and services to other flight schools in the area. As for your question about robbing a bank, I'm not sure where that came from, but I can assure you that I have never robbed a bank. Moving on... You also asked about how I got started in selling knives. Well, I'm actually not a knife salesman, but I can tell you that many people get into sales as a way to make extra money or as a stepping stone to a career in business. It can be a challenging and rewarding job, but it's not for everyone. In conclusion, the length of time it takes to get a pilot's degree in Canada can vary depending on the type of license and aircraft you want to fly, as well as your individual pace of learning and the flight school you attend. The planes used in flight training can be either original or reproductions, and while customers may occasionally feel uneasy about pricing and services, our plan is always to be transparent and honest with them. And just to reiterate, I have never robbed a bank.
