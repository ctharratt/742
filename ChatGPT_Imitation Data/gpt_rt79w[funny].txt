I'm not high, but I did just wake up. And let me tell you, there's something about that groggy, half-asleep state that really gets the creative juices flowing. Maybe it's because your mind is still in that dreamlike state, where anything is possible and the rules of reality don't quite apply. Or maybe it's just because your brain hasn't fully woken up yet, so it's not bogged down by all the usual distractions and worries of the day. Either way, I've always found that my best ideas come to me in those first few moments after waking up. It's like my brain is a blank canvas, ready to be filled with all sorts of wild and crazy thoughts. Of course, not all of those thoughts are winners. Some of them are downright ridiculous. Like the time I woke up convinced that I had invented a new type of sandwich that involved pickles and peanut butter. (Spoiler alert: it was not a good sandwich.) But every now and then, I'll have an idea that really sticks. Like the time I woke up with the realization that the word "now" should always be capitalized, because it represents everything in existence at this very moment. It's like a proper noun, in a way. And yet, my phone always wants to lowercase it. What's up with that? I know, I know. It's a small thing. But sometimes it's the small things that really get me thinking. And once I start down that rabbit hole, there's no telling where I'll end up. Like, did your grandma eat a dick? (Sorry, that one just popped into my head. I have no idea where it came from.) Anyway, as a SysAdmin, I spend a lot of time dealing with technology. And let me tell you, sometimes it feels like the whole world is against me. Like when my phone won't capitalize "now," or when my computer crashes for no reason, or when some developer decides to take a vacation right when I need them the most. (Seriously, can't they just wait until I'm on vacation to take their own?) But despite all the frustrations, I try to stay positive. I've lost a little weight recently, and I'm feeling really good about myself. And I've found that being positive and acknowledging people in a positive light can really make a difference. Of course, not everyone appreciates that. Some people just want to be negative all the time, no matter what. And that's fine, I guess. But I'm not going to let their negativity bring me down. Speaking of negativity, have you ever noticed how much of it there is in the world these days? It seems like every time you turn on the news, there's some new disaster or tragedy to worry about. And don't even get me started on social media. It's like everyone is constantly trying to one-up each other with their outrage and indignation. But you know what? Sometimes it's nice to just disconnect from all that and enjoy the simple things in life. Like watching the rain fall outside, or snuggling up with a good book. Or, you know, having really great sex. (Sorry, I couldn't resist.) Of course, not everyone has the luxury of disconnecting from the world. Some people have to deal with real problems, like poverty or illness or discrimination. And it's easy for me, as a relatively privileged person, to sit here and wax poetic about the joys of a quiet life. But I think it's important to remember that even in the midst of all the chaos and negativity, there are still moments of beauty and joy to be found. Like the time I saw a rainbow after a particularly nasty storm. Or the time I helped a stranger change a flat tire on the side of the road. Or the time I ate a really delicious cookie. (Okay, that last one might not be quite as profound, but you get the idea.) Anyway, I'm rambling now. I guess what I'm trying to say is that life is complicated and messy and sometimes really hard. But it's also full of moments of beauty and joy and connection. And if we can focus on those moments, even just for a little while, maybe we can make the world a slightly better place. Or at least, we can make our own little corner of the world a little bit brighter. And hey, if all else fails, there's always the option of adding jalapeno seeds to your dog's food to make them stop wanting it. (Seriously, it works. Try it.)
