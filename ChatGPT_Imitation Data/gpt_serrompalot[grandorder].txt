What even is this?! A level 2 alt just got these rolls. I feel like you could've done a better job of making the extension of the background less obvious (The most egregious of which is the upper portion with the almost rhythmic repetition of petals). I don't know why but I came in here reading and expecting Mario the Ripper. You had your chance when the free 4* event was around! Or you could have Saint Martha and it wouldn't matter because she can lift Tamacat's stun. You call that a harem? This is a harem! Huh, I live an hour from a Kinokuniya by bus in Japantown. Artist looks a lot like redrop :o Why should you be ashamed? Hayamin best Rider confirmed. I would think it represents fertility. Google's similar image search is your friend. Pretty nice, nose and shoulders are a bit too big, but you at least have the general form and proportion down. Grats. I haven't been playing much for a few days, and I can't even go past 5 ap event for some reason to farm monuments, so I guess I'm stuck. To be honest, the 30 AP mission is harder for me than the 40 AP. With the dragon softening up my team for the 2nd round with 2-3 criticals each turn, I have a hard time surviving the onslaught. The only more annoying thing is when Nero casts her EX Defense/Heal 2-3 times in a row, making it impossible to do significant damage even with debuffs. Pretty much. Whenever Shielder is in my party she's pretty much all I get, so it's starting to get fucking annoying because she's making me lose. Grats. I'd like to farm monuments, but I have class for 11 hours on 4-Knight monument days. Haha, 1 Saber monument? Wait till you need TEN MORE! I've only fought Marie, but when she uses her invulnerability, extra comboes still do damage. Marie is my devil. She keeps on spawning and spawning... AND NEVER DROPS A MONUMENT!!! After the 4 monuments, you need 10 more monuments. And Reverse Scales. Talons are easier because you can farm them week-round, but the other two? Shit outta luck m8. Chimera fangs aren't as bad as Reverse Scales since you can farm them week round in the Rome map for 15AP. I give all mine to Martha immediately. Waifu can get pretty hungry. I, too, saw this on twitter. A japanese artist had some sort of incredulous response to the image. Facepalm. You'd think with someone complaining about a lost account because of not getting their code nigh on every day, people would know better. I have a bunch of spare accounts with either Atalanta or Lancelot, and a Tamamog :o. Yes, yes I was. I couldn't manage the grind alongside my schoolwork though, so I had to quit. What about when the alt account rolls rainbow and regular saber? :/ Martha, nice heals, pretty tanky though there are too many fucking Assassins for cereal, and she can lift stuns and debuffs (This is KILLER.) Aside from that she's voiced by Hayamin and has a sexy, yet demure character design. Her only weakness is too many Assassin ghosts. Rolled Arturia on my alt with the free ticket. My god. Now I have Rainbow and traditional Saber in my team, and Kiyohime. Waifu, I am the greatest Martha lover. Nah, I think you just ran into a spate of good luck. I just did a run with only one silver at the end. About a whole week of doing nothing but grinding for Yggdrasil seeds. Rider monuments took 2 ascension days and about 8-10 quartz, and I got the 3 talons in Friday Monster Hunt for about 6-7 quartz. To be honest, I'd say it's actually easier to level Jeanne because she doesn't need rare or nonexistent ascension materials. But for reference, my 4-star going from level 60-63 took about 20 silver and 5 gold cards, most of them with class-bonus. Monster Hunt bosses are usually rare boss enemies that you usually won't find much anywhere else. The boss of the 20 AP quest is a Chimera, which drops Talon of Chaos. The ascension item quests are specifically for monuments only. Wasn't there a webm earlier that showed a guy feeding Gil, Attila, Ruler, and other things to someone? Come on man, you can surely do better than that. Those were some huge edits there my friend. My alt just rolled it as well for its Attila. Apparently the cloth increases defense against male enemies by 25%. 110 on my main, because I am god damn well going to get Martha as strong as possible because waifu. She's a very good support, and pretty tanky as well. I don't know why, but she has near-same stats at level 60 as Jeanne D'Arc does at level 60. Aside from that, she has a heal and a smaller heal that removes all debuffs and status effects, including Tamamog and Jeanne's self-stun-via-Noble Phantasm. It removes all negative effects at once, from what I've seen. My face when server was in maintenance so I had to sleep, missed Rider event, and couldn't get the last gold monument I needed before the day switched over and have to wait a week. I did the Orleans map exclusively for my Wyvern Tusks. Drop rate was pretty sour, but not torturous. But doesn't Aigis have 6 star units as well? I'm the same, but for Yggdrasil Seeds. 15 runs so far and not a single seed, and I need 8 more of them. A super-ascension for select servants, one at a time, like they do in Granblue Fantasy for both SR and SSR units would be nice. The SR with a super-evolve had slightly superior stats to the typical SSR, but the cost and resulting grind to get there was very high as well. Possibly the highest level Martha in the English community. I got a buttload of friend points yesterday when people were farming Master EXP :D. It took me 4-5 gems to get three chimera talons, I was worried it might take longer but praise RNGesus. The point of backing up is to have multiple copies, not just one copy. Do you think maybe Servants' Luck might have anything to do with drop rates? This happened to me, I had a conversation with Lynette and we concluded it was because other classes have a higher chance to draw the stars to them compared to Berserkers. Notice your two Berserkers, I had the same except with Martha. Not really, I constantly get the old 'gambler's fallacy' bs. Statistics proves that as you roll more, the chance of you getting what you want increases. In gambling, the chance to get what you want is already so microscopically tiny that each consecutive go doesn't do much. I think you're getting confused, it hasn't reset for me since the game came out. Huh, I see. Makes sense now. I assume this is undocumented, like how everyone has a slightly different modifier to and from Berserkers. I've been experimenting with different supports, and I'm starting to think it might just be that Berserkers draw less stars compared to normal servant classes. When I run a Martha-TwoZerk team, she grabs almost all the stars, and when Darius dies and gets replaced by Mashu, or my support isn't Vlad, star distribution seemed to spread out. I'll have to continue my observations. Alright, I'll start documenting. What's a good method to use, just write it down in pastebin or something? I took these screenshots just now in two consecutive turns. I have to say, I'm a bit confused by all of this. It seems like there are a lot of different topics being discussed here, and I'm not sure how they all relate to each other. But I'll do my best to address each one in turn. First of all, I'm not sure what the level 2 alt is that you're referring to. Are you talking about a new account that someone created? And what do you mean by "rolls"? Are you talking about the gacha system in the game? As for the background, I'm not sure what you mean by the "extension of the background." Could you clarify that for me? And what's wrong with the repetition of petals? I'm also not sure what you mean by "Mario the Ripper." Is that a reference to something? Moving on, I'm not sure what you mean by "free 4* event." Could you explain that a bit more? And who is Tamacat? And why does Saint Martha being able to lift her stun matter? I'm also not sure what you mean by "this is a harem." Are you talking about the number of female characters in the game? And what's Kinokuniya? And who is redrop? I'm not sure what you mean by "Hayamin best Rider confirmed." Who is Hayamin? As for the image you're discussing, I'm not sure what it is or what the artist's response was. Moving on, I'm not sure what you mean by "I can't even go
