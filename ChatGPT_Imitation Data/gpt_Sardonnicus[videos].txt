I never thought I'd see the day when I would witness the "tipping intensifies" guy in real life. He was wearing what looked like a tablecloth or something, and it was quite a sight to behold. I'm currently at my sister's house for the holidays, and it's been a nice change of pace. But, as always, drama seems to follow me wherever I go. Recently, there has been talk in the neighborhood about a certain xvideo link that appeared on the dash display of someone's car. It's caused quite a stir, and everyone seems to have their own theories about who could have done it. Personally, I think it was just some bored teenager trying to cause trouble. But that's not the only drama going on in the neighborhood. There's this one guy who always parks his car in the visitor spot right in front of his house, even though he already has an assigned spot. It's like he's doing everything he can to have two spots when everyone else only gets one. The community office says they can't really do anything about it since it's a visitor spot and available to anyone, but I think they just don't want to deal with it. Then there's the guy who parked his busted, out-of-inspection work van in the very first visitor spot, the one closest to everyone's door. He didn't move that van for over six months, and even left threatening notes on people's cars who parked in that spot. It's ridiculous, but the community office can't really do much about it. Living in a neighborhood with a lot of Latin Americans means there are way more cars than parking spaces. It's a constant struggle to find a spot, and it's frustrating when people are so selfish and inconsiderate. But, as they say, real men don't get goaded into doing something stupid. We just have to let it go and be the bigger person. On a more positive note, it's great to see people of different races coming together to help each other out. I recently witnessed a group of bikers helping a stranded motorist, and it restored my faith in humanity. It's moments like these that remind us that we're all in this together. Speaking of bikers, I couldn't help but wonder if the biker I saw was The Zoltan. He's a local legend around here, and it would be pretty cool to meet him in person. But enough about the neighborhood drama. Let's talk about something more fun, like rollercoasters. I've never been on one before, but I've always wanted to try. I just hope they can accommodate gentlemen who have advanced cases of Gigantia, like 500 pounds of Gigantia. That would be quite the sight to see. In other news, I recently started playing a new game, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price tag. It feels like a complete game, but there's not enough content to justify the $60 price tag. It's also multiplayer only, which is a shame. It could have been so much more if it had a large single or co-op campaign. Speaking of things that could have been better, losing weight is a great accomplishment, but it's not a magical cure-all for all your problems. I know this from personal experience, as I lost over 120 pounds. The mental battle of adjusting to your new weight can be even harder than actually losing the weight. Your brain develops an inner picture of yourself, and it can be hard to adjust to the new you. It's important to remind yourself that the new you is okay, and to be prepared for the mental battle that comes with weight loss. But, at the end of the day, losing weight is worth it. It will make you healthier and happier, even if it doesn't solve all your problems. And, as always, good night and good luck.
