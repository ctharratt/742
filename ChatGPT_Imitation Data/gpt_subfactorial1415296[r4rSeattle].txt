I can relate to Charlie's pain. It's like we're both fish out of water, struggling to survive in a world that doesn't seem to care about us. I've been living alone for years, too, without anyone to turn to when I need a hug or a soft touch. It's a lonely existence, and it's hard to keep going when you feel like no one cares. I want someone who cares, too. Someone who can give me the emotions I so desperately crave. It doesn't matter if I don't know her yet - if she gives me even the slightest hope of change, I would be in love with her. I know it sounds crazy, but when you're as lonely as I am, you'll take any chance you can get. It's frustrating to see how differently men and women are treated in our society. If you're a guy asking for a girl, you're seen as desperate or creepy. But if you're a girl feeling lonely, people are quick to offer sympathy and support. It's not fair, and it's not right. I've tried posting on dating sites and forums, but it always seems like a waste of time. I've never gotten a legit reply to any of my m4f posts, and it's disheartening. It's like I'm shouting into the void, and no one is listening. I know it's not reasonable to meet a random stranger off the internet, but sometimes it feels like the only option. It's like playing the lottery - you know the odds are against you, but you keep hoping that maybe, just maybe, you'll get lucky. It's hard to keep going when every response feels like acid on your soul. It's hard to keep putting yourself out there when it seems like no one cares. But I can't give up. I can't let my inner romantic spirit be suppressed and choked out of existence. I know it's not all the fault of women or society or anyone else. I have my own issues and insecurities to deal with. But it's hard not to feel like I'm being punished for something I can't control - my desire for human connection. I don't know what the answer is. I don't know how to find the love and connection I so desperately crave. But I do know that I can't give up. I have to keep trying, keep putting myself out there, even if it feels like no one is listening. Maybe someday, I'll find someone who cares. Maybe someday, I'll find the love and connection I've been searching for. Until then, I'll keep hoping, keep dreaming, and keep putting myself out there. Because the alternative is too bleak to contemplate.
