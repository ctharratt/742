When I first joined the reserves, I never thought I'd be in this position. I always thought that the health insurance was the best part of the deal. But now, as I sit here staring at a bill for $43,000, I'm not so sure. It all started when my daughter broke both her legs. She was riding in a shopping cart being supervised by my wife's idiot man-child brother. He flipped the cart and broke both her legs. She was driven two hours via ambulance to a children's hospital where she had to have surgery on one of the legs. That was like 10 weeks ago. She has had several follow ups and the casts and pins are gone and she's starting to walk with a walker. So here I am thinking things are going to be ok and I get this statement from tricare. I feel absolutely lost. It took me a year to save up 3 grand to go to Disneyland. If I'm on the hook for over 40K I'm FUCKED. And the idiot who did it can't pay either. He has a roommate to pay for a $600 appartment, rides his bike to work and just knocked up his girl. I'm torn about staying in the reserves. This year I had one daughter get heart surgery and another with two broken legs. I know I'm a quarter million dollar write off for tricare this year. I'd like to stay in but I've been gone for almost 8 weeks added up this year and that's really hard when you are running a business. I'm really not sure what to do. I'm starting to change my views on universal health care. At first I was worried that it might stifle progress. Without a profit incentive, why cure diseases? But now I'm seeing how fast this is spinning out of control. I had my appendix out years ago in an emergency surgery with a 5 day hospital stay. The whole bill was $8,000 and my insurance covered $7,900 of it. Now my daughter was in the hospital for 2 days with emergency surgery and it was $43,000. Not sustainable. I'm working with tricare to figure this out. It's all up in the air until they see that DD2527 and decide what they want to do. I'll pm you if it doesn't go my way and I need help. Thank you. I pay a little over $200 bucks a month for me, my wife and three kids for Tricare. For all its faults, it can't be beat. I had two of my three kids on it, been sick a couple times myself, my youngest daughter needed heart surgery, my oldest had two broken legs, and I haven't lost my home or fucked up my credit like most people with a lot of medical stuff. But now, as I stare at this bill, I'm not so sure. I feel like I'm being punished for something that wasn't my fault. My daughter's broken legs were caused by someone else's negligence, yet I'm the one who has to pay for it. I'm not sure what to do. I'm torn between staying in the reserves and leaving. On the one hand, I love serving my country and I love the health insurance. On the other hand, I can't afford to be on the hook for $43,000. I know that some people will say that I should have had better insurance or that I should have been more careful. But the truth is, accidents happen. And when they do, it shouldn't bankrupt you. I'm not sure what the solution is. Maybe we need universal health care. Maybe we need better insurance options. Maybe we need to hold people accountable for their actions. All I know is that I'm scared. I'm scared for my daughter's future. I'm scared for my family's future. And I'm scared for the future of our country. I hope that someday we can find a solution to this problem. Until then, I'll keep fighting for my family and for my country. And I'll keep praying that everything works out in the end.
