I work at a movie theater and let me tell you, the release of the latest Star Wars movie has been a rollercoaster of emotions and chaos. First of all, let's talk about the security measures that have been put in place. The hard drives containing the movie are remotely locked and the digital unlocking keys are only active on the day of the screening, sometimes even just hours before. This is to prevent any pirated copies from being leaked online and to ensure that the box office numbers are as high as possible. I get it, Disney wants to protect their investment, but it's also frustrating for us as employees. We received an email from management about the security measures and it was clear that they were taking this very seriously. I was excited to watch the movie multiple times, but now I'm not even sure if I'll get to see it once. The thought of vomit and explosive diarrhea on separate occasions is enough to make me want to avoid the theater altogether. Thankfully, we have a powder that turns into a scoopable gel to clean up any messes, but the thought of popcorn everywhere and long lines with impatient customers is enough to make me want to call in sick. Speaking of long lines, the release of this movie has been insane. We have assigned seating at my theater, but that doesn't stop people from sitting in the wrong seats or going to the wrong theater/showing. And let's not forget about the drunk, rude, and loud people who think it's okay to act like they're at a bar instead of a movie theater. Sure, you can drink here, but that doesn't mean you can act like a fool. And then there are the complaints. High ticket and food prices, the temperature in the theater, the broken paper towel and soap dispensers in the bathroom, the broken food machines, and the fact that we're going to run out of something or another. It's like people forget that we're human beings trying to do our jobs and not just robots programmed to cater to their every whim. But despite all of the chaos and frustration, there's still something magical about the release of a new Star Wars movie. The excitement in the air is palpable and it's clear that people are genuinely excited to see it. I've seen fans dressed up in full costume, families with young children, and groups of friends who have been waiting for this moment for months. It's a reminder that movies have the power to bring people together and create a sense of community. And let's not forget about the movie itself. I haven't had the chance to see it yet, but the trailers look amazing. The special effects, the action sequences, and the return of beloved characters all make for an exciting viewing experience. Of course, there are always going to be people who nitpick and find fault with every little detail, but at the end of the day, it's just a movie. It's meant to entertain and transport us to another world, if only for a few hours. In the end, the release of a new Star Wars movie is both a blessing and a curse for those of us who work at movie theaters. It's exciting to be a part of something so big and to see the joy on people's faces as they leave the theater, but it's also exhausting and frustrating to deal with the chaos and complaints. But hey, that's just part of the job. And who knows, maybe I'll even get to see the movie myself one of these days.
