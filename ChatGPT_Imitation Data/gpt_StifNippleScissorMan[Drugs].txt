The world of psychedelics is a strange and unpredictable one. As someone who has dabbled in various substances, I can attest to the fact that each experience is unique and often difficult to predict. Take shrooms, for example. I've had nights where I've taken 12 grams and been able to function (in a loose sense of the word), and other nights where 4 grams have practically rendered me comatose. It pays to err on the side of caution when it comes to these things. The effects of shrooms can be compared to snorting 250mg's of ketamine and laying down with a blindfold. At first, everything seems normal. I can see the inside of my room quite clearly. But then things start to get weird. I get absolutely floored. I can't walk, I'm too wobbly. I experience closed and open eye hallucinations. The world starts spinning. I hear music and voices. I get sick and vomit. It's a wild ride, to say the least. I don't smoke weed. It's too intense for me. But 12 grams of shrooms? Sure, let's party. However, I can't handle any decent dose of weed. It's just too much for me. It's interesting how different substances affect people in different ways. Acid is another popular psychedelic, but it's expensive and hard to come by where I live. It's never totally risk-free, but it's about as close as you can get, at least when it comes to tabs of acid. They're usually handed out at sports events, like the one I said I was attending. They're used to inflate these things and make a loud as fuck clapping sound. It's a unique experience, to say the least. I remember once being questioned by the police after they ransacked my house and found a bunch of shrooms. The guy asked me if I planned on smoking them. It felt good being able to answer at least one of their questions honestly. It wasn't in my carry-on. It was inside a bookmark, in a book, in my suitcase. The day airport security starts ripping apart bookmarks in locked suitcases looking for drugs, I'll stop putting drugs in bookmarks in locked suitcases. I've had some wild experiences on psychedelics. One time, a group of 11 young, healthy-looking men drunkenly stumbled into a bar we soon realized was a gay bar. After spending about 5 hours showered in free drinks, both from other patrons and the bar itself, we stumbled back to the hotel. We took a wrong turn and ended up stumbling through the red light district. People in that district after 4 am on Friday nights aren't exactly "low key" about what they're selling. We stumbled past a fair deal of cocaine and heroin, but as we stumbled past the acid, I couldn't keep my wallet closed. I've also attended music festivals on psychedelics. It's an experience like no other. How high are you right now? I've been there twice now. It's definitely worth it. Do yourself a favor and buy the premium ticket. Better seating, free food, free beer, goodie bag, all-around good shit. All the signing sessions were in the premium area as well this year. But with all the fun comes the risk. I remember once getting caught with drugs in my luggage at the airport. I expected a metal detector, like I assume quite a few other people would expect to find at an airport as well. That's why I felt it was important to mention the fact that it wasn't a metal detector. I didn't mean to come off all defensive, so sorry if I did. I'm just trying to clarify what I wrote. I've also had some close calls with the law. One time, I got arrested for import and possession of illegal narcotics with intent to sell. It was a wake-up call for me. I was taken from work, taken home, unlocked the door so they wouldn't have to break it down, then went in for questioning. It was a scary experience, and it made me realize that the risks of using psychedelics are very real. But despite the risks, I still find myself drawn to these substances. There's something about the altered state of consciousness that's both fascinating and alluring. It's a way to escape reality for a little while and explore the depths of your own mind. Of course, not all psychedelics are created equal. Some are more intense than others. Nangs, for example, are whippets, named so by the sound that pounds through your ears while you're fucked up on them. They're a popular choice among drug users, but they're not without their risks. I've also tried MXE a few times, but I got sick of it pretty quickly. It was way too long-lasting for my taste. Ketamine, on the other hand, is simple. Rail 300 (ish) mg's, put on a blindfold and some music, then lie down and don't move for two hours. The next couple of hours after that, you're gonna be pretty sluggish, but then it's all okay. K is definitely quite "sterile" when it comes to happiness or glowing feelings. It's just the absolute disconnection from everything physical that I love about it. In conclusion, the world of psychedelics is a strange and unpredictable one. Each experience is unique and often difficult to predict. But despite the risks, there's something alluring about the altered state of consciousness that these substances provide. It's a way to escape reality for a little while and explore the depths of your own mind. Just remember to be safe and always err on the side of caution.
