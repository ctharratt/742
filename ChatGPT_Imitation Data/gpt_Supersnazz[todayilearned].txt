I don't know about you, but I've always found the idea of a man wearing a "Obama is a nigger!" t-shirt to be both hilarious and offensive. It's like stating the obvious in the most offensive way possible. It's like saying "Hillary Clinton has shit kids out her pussy!" or "George Bush does big turds out his honky white ass!" It's just ridiculous. But let's move on to something a bit more serious. Did you know that Visa used to be a co-op owned by the banks that issued cards? If a bank wanted to issue a Visa card, they would join the co-op and become a part owner of the Visa organization. Nowadays, it's just a regular listed company, but it's interesting to think about how it used to be. Now, let's talk about voting. What if there isn't someone you want to vote for? Well, you can always write "None of these candidates are any good" on the ballot, tear it up, or write "I refuse to vote" or register as an objector. There are plenty of ways to have your objections heard. I once forgot to vote in a council election, but I just said that I did. It's not like anyone was going to check. Moving on to sports, did you know that Australia didn't send anyone for the 100m, 200m, or 400m at the Munich Olympics? It's true. And speaking of things that may or may not be true, there's no evidence that Elizabeth Taylor's daughter even died of AIDS. Apparently, an Iraqi veterinarian told her it was an allergic reaction to penicillin. Who knows what the truth is? But let's talk about something that is definitely true. If you have eyes, you are related to every other organism with eyes. That's what a species is - closely related organisms. It's kind of mind-blowing when you think about it. Now, let's talk about something that's a bit controversial - the Westboro Baptist Church. They admit that suing people is how they fund the church, but it's not why they do it. They actually spend more on protests than they earn in lawsuits. They sue so they can afford to protest, not the other way around. It's kind of crazy when you think about it, but it's true. Moving on to something a bit lighter, did you know that the most printed biological organism in The Far Side isn't even a cow? There have been more than 127 cows in The Far Side. It's crazy to think about, but it's true. Now, let's talk about tattoos. Generally, tattoos for medical reasons are legal on kids. But what about tattoos for other reasons? Well, it depends on where you live. But generally speaking, tattoos for kids are frowned upon. Moving on to travel, I found Paris to be beautiful, charming, exciting, romantic, and utterly pleasurable in every way. It didn't seem expensive or noticeably dirty either. But that's just my opinion. Now, let's talk about something that's a bit more serious - the story of Chito and his crocodile. Chito claims that his crocodile, Pocho, felt love towards him after being shot in the head. But is it really possible for a gunshot wound to modify a crocodile's brain in such a way? It's hard to say. There have been plenty of stories throughout history of people who believed they had reciprocal love with wild animals, only to be attacked by those animals. It's definitely something to think about. Moving on to something a bit more lighthearted, did you know that people who like spicy food are more likely to be alcoholics? It's true. But it's probably just a correlation, not causation. Now, let's talk about something that's a bit controversial - the use of the word "extras" to describe background performers. Some people in the industry refer to them as "background performers," while others refer to them as "extras." It's just a matter of preference, really. Moving on to history, did you know that the Mormons and Native Americans worked together in the Wild West? It's true. And speaking of the Wild West, if you can't slaughter everyone in a wagon train, what's the point of even being there in the first place? Now, let's talk about something that's a bit more serious - the idea that some people shouldn't have children. It's a controversial topic, but it's something that needs to be discussed. If you can't afford to have children, you probably shouldn't. But what if you do? It's a tough question, and there's no easy answer. Moving on to literature, did you know that we no longer know what fruit the "forbidden fruit" in the Bible was? It's true. But that's hardly a reason to not bother reading one of the most important pieces of literature in history. And finally, let's talk about something that's a bit more lighthearted - the fact that if all the presidents before Obama were black, he would be the first white president. It's just a funny little fact, but it's true. In conclusion, there are plenty of interesting and controversial topics out there to discuss. Whether it's the Westboro Baptist Church, the use of the word "extras," or the idea that some people shouldn't have children, there's always something to talk about. So let's keep the conversation going.
