The return of Georges St-Pierre to the UFC has been a topic of discussion for quite some time now. Fans have been eagerly waiting for the former welterweight champion to make his comeback to the octagon. And now, it seems like their wait is finally over. GSP has announced that he will be returning to active competition in the UFC, and fans couldn't be more excited. But with his return, comes the question of who he will face in the welterweight division. Many fans are wondering if GSP will be able to hang with the current crop of fighters in the division. Some have even gone as far as to say that the division has changed so much since GSP last fought that he won't be able to compete at the same level as before. But is that really the case? Let's take a look at the current welterweight division and see who GSP could potentially face. First up, we have the current champion, Kamaru Usman. Usman has been on a tear lately, and many consider him to be one of the best welterweights in the world. But is he really a threat to GSP? It's hard to say. Usman is a great wrestler and has some heavy hands, but GSP has faced wrestlers and strikers of Usman's caliber before. It's safe to say that GSP would be able to hold his own against Usman. Next up, we have Colby Covington. Covington is another wrestler with some decent striking. He's been calling out GSP for a while now, and many fans would love to see this fight happen. But again, it's hard to say if Covington would be a real threat to GSP. Covington has never faced anyone of GSP's caliber, and it's hard to say how he would fare against the former champion. Then we have Jorge Masvidal. Masvidal has been on a roll lately, with some impressive wins over the likes of Nate Diaz and Ben Askren. He's a great striker with some solid grappling skills. But again, it's hard to say if he would be a real threat to GSP. Masvidal has never faced anyone like GSP before, and it's hard to say how he would fare against the former champion. Finally, we have Leon Edwards. Edwards is a great striker with some solid grappling skills. He's been on a roll lately, with some impressive wins over the likes of Rafael dos Anjos and Donald Cerrone. But again, it's hard to say if he would be a real threat to GSP. Edwards has never faced anyone like GSP before, and it's hard to say how he would fare against the former champion. So, who does that leave us with? Well, there are a few fighters that GSP hasn't faced before that could potentially give him some trouble. First up, we have Tyron Woodley. Woodley is a great wrestler with some heavy hands. He's been the champion before and has faced some tough competition. It's safe to say that Woodley would be a real threat to GSP. Then we have Demian Maia. Maia is a great grappler with some decent striking. He's been in the game for a long time and has faced some tough competition. It's safe to say that Maia would be a real threat to GSP. Finally, we have Robbie Lawler. Lawler is a great striker with some solid grappling skills. He's been in the game for a long time and has faced some tough competition. It's safe to say that Lawler would be a real threat to GSP. So, there you have it. The welterweight division hasn't changed much since GSP last fought. There are a few fighters that he hasn't faced before that could potentially give him some trouble, but for the most part, he would be able to hang with anyone in the top of the division. Fans can't wait to see who GSP will face in his comeback fight, and it's safe to say that whoever it is, it will be a great fight.
