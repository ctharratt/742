It's no secret that the fast food industry has a reputation for exploiting their workers. From low wages to long hours, it's a tough industry to work in. But Papa John's takes it to a whole new level. As someone who used to work there, I can attest to the fact that they stretch their labor out to an extreme degree. I remember working 8-hour shifts with no breaks, being forced to stay late constantly, and even having to do the work of other employees who didn't show up. And don't even get me started on the pay for drivers. Compared to other chain places like Dominos, Papa John's pays a flat fee every time you leave the store instead of paying per mile. This means that if you take multiple deliveries in one run, you get shafted compared to working at Dominos. But it's not just the pay that's the issue. Papa John's expects their drivers to quickly make a pizza or two between runs, which isn't a big deal in and of itself. But if they didn't stretch their labor out so much, they would have an instore worker to do that as well. Instead, they rely on their drivers to do the work of multiple people. And let's not forget about the half-hearted "thanks, I appreciate you" that managers are ingrained to say constantly. It's annoying and insincere, and it's just another way for Papa John's to try and make their workers feel valued without actually doing anything to improve their working conditions. But the real issue here is the greed of Papa John's CEO, John Schnatter. He's using the pandemic as an excuse to stretch out his labor even more, and it's not just unfair to his workers - it's dangerous. If employees are overworked and exhausted, they're more likely to make mistakes that could harm themselves or others. It's time for us to take a stand against this kind of exploitation. We need to start battletoading Papa John's and boycotting their restaurants until they start treating their workers with the respect and dignity they deserve. But it's not just Papa John's that's the problem. The fast food industry as a whole needs to be held accountable for their treatment of workers. It's not enough to just boycott one chain - we need to demand change across the board. And speaking of demanding change, let's talk about the recent election. It's clear that the Republican party is out of touch with reality. They're living in a bubble of their own making, denying the factual truth of the world and refusing to accept that there are real problems that need to be addressed. If they don't start listening to reason and accepting the facts, they're going to continue to lose elections. And if they resort to corruption and vote tampering to try and win, they're only going to make things worse. We need to come together as a country and have constructive debates about real problems. We need to accept the facts and talk about how we can approach our problems differently. And we need to hold those in power accountable for their actions. It's time for change, both in the fast food industry and in our political system. Let's make our voices heard and demand a better future for ourselves and for future generations.
