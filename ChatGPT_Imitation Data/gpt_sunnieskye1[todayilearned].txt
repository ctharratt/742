I have to say, I completely agree with Charlie's sentiment about the banning of the FatPeopleHate subreddit on Reddit. It's supposed to be a platform for free speech, and while I understand that there were some users who were doxxing and harassing outside of the subreddit, banning the entire community seems like an extreme measure. If someone is being abusive or harassing others, then they should be banned individually. But to ban an entire community because some members are behaving badly is like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. It's not fair to the majority of users who were simply using the subreddit to discuss their opinions and experiences. And let's be real here, if someone who is obese is coming onto a subreddit that they know will offend them, then that's their problem. They're just looking for a fight and stirring up drama. It's not necessary and it's not productive. Moving on to a completely different topic, I found it fascinating to read about Yao Ming's birth and how it was anticipated for decades by communist officials in China. It's amazing how much importance can be placed on sports and national pride. It's also interesting to think about how much pressure Yao must have felt growing up, knowing that he was being watched and tracked by officials from a young age. Speaking of pressure, I can't even imagine the pressure that was put on American kids during the Vietnam War era. The fact that there was a draft and young men were being forced to go fight in a war that many of them didn't believe in is just mind-boggling to me. It's a good thing we haven't had a draft since then. Moving on to a more lighthearted topic, I have to say that I'm a huge fan of Tolkien's work. The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit are both amazing books, and the world that Tolkien created is so rich and detailed. I could spend hours reading about the history of Middle Earth and the different races and cultures that inhabit it. And while we're on the topic of books, I have to say that I agree with Charlie that books are almost always better than movies. There's just something about being able to use your imagination to create the world and characters in your mind that can't be replicated on screen. But getting back to a more serious topic, I was really interested to read about the Chernobyl accident and how the area is being left to revitalize on its own. It's amazing to think about how nature can bounce back and reclaim an area that was once so devastated by human error. However, it's also sad to think about the animals that are still suffering from the effects of the radiation. It's a reminder that our actions can have long-lasting consequences that we may not even be aware of. And finally, I have to say that I completely agree with Charlie's point about wanting to see a legitimate drama that isn't afraid to show well-acted sex. It's frustrating to see so many movies and TV shows that use sex as a cheap plot device or as a way to titillate the audience. If a movie or TV show is going to include sex, then it should be done in a way that is respectful and meaningful. It shouldn't be something that is thrown in just to get a rise out of the audience. Overall, I think Charlie has some really interesting and thought-provoking opinions on a wide range of topics. I look forward to reading more of their writing in the future.
