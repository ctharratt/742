I have to say, the hate that Jennifer Lawrence gets on Reddit is just ridiculous. I mean, sure, not everyone has to like her, but the level of vitriol that some people spew towards her is just uncalled for. And the worst part is that a lot of it seems to stem from her speaking out against the Fappening and calling it what it is: sexual assault. I mean, seriously, can you blame her for that? But of course, a lot of people on Reddit were more interested in searching out those stolen pictures and whacking it than they were in respecting someone's privacy and consent. And when Lawrence had the audacity to call them out on it, they freaked out and started hating on her. And now, of course, they're all on this "OMG she's so fake and a bad actress" train. But you can pinpoint the day when the flip in attitudes happened, so it's more after-the-fact justification. It's worse because you're dealing with the JLaw haters, but because RedLetterMedia hates her too, you're dealing with JLaw haters mixed with obnoxious RLM fans. And don't even get me started on that whole "rude to the reporter" thing. Lawrence was doing a Q&A and the reporter was filming her while asking the question. Lawrence only said what she did because it's only common courtesy to look at someone when interviewing them. The reporter had perfect English, so there was no reason for Lawrence to assume he didn't understand her. And yet, people on Reddit still use that incident as evidence that she's a terrible person. But of course, Mike and Jay are the greatest minds known to man and we should always abide by what they decree. PRAISE BE TO RLM!!!!! It's just ridiculous how much influence they have over the opinions of people on Reddit. They hate Jennifer Lawrence, they hate The Martian, they hate The Revenant, they worship Tom Hardy, they love Mad Max: Fury Road, they label The Danish Girl as Oscar bait. And if you dare to disagree with them, you'll get downvoted into oblivion. It's like they can't handle someone not liking something as much as they do. I remember when I said I thought Fury Road was just okay, and all the /r/movies nutjobs berated me for hours about how I just "didn't get it" and I just didn't appreciate all its subtle themes and supposed "world-building". People on Reddit need to chill and accept that film is a subjective medium. And don't even get me started on their love for Interstellar. I mean, it has good moments, but as a whole, it's a plot hole-ridden mess that doesn't hold up well on repeat viewings at all. The Martian is just a better-made film with characters you actually give a shit about and who aren't just plot devices to get the plot moving along. But of course, Nolan can do no wrong in the eyes of /r/movies. It's like they think he's some sort of God among men. I like his films, but goddamn it, /r/movies acts like he's infallible. And don't even get me started on the whole "risky superhero movie" thing. I really hope R-rated superhero movies don't become the new Hollywood craze, and it most likely will be due to Deadpool. Studios should only make superhero films R if the story demands it, not just because /r/movies scream and stamp their foot. And the worst part is that a lot of this hate seems to stem from blind sexism. I mean, look at how they suddenly started talking about Ghostbusters 1&2 as these classic films that they all love when a year ago, none of them would talk about them. They almost try to fool people into thinking it's not just because the new Ghostbusters has an all-female cast. It's just sad how low that sub can sink sometimes. But I guess that's what happens when you have a bunch of people who think they're film experts just because they spend all day on Reddit.
