I recently went to Disneyland and let me tell you, it was a wild ride. I saw all sorts of people working there, from white to black and everything in between. It was great to see such diversity in the workforce. But let's talk about something more important, like Emily Blunt. That woman is a goddess. Not only is she incredibly sexy, but she's also versatile and talented. I mean, she could play Rocky Balboa and I'd still think she was best suited for the role. And don't even get me started on her acting skills. She's a force to be reckoned with. Now, let's talk about some movies. Jurassic World? Rubbish. The only good things about it were Chris Pratt and watching Bryce Dallas Howard run around in a tank top. If we're going Australian, let's talk about Hugh Jackman or Eric Bana. Those guys are the real deal. But let's not forget about Lake Bell. She's highly underrated as an actress and she's damn nice to look at. And Joel Edgerton? He's a brilliant Australian actor turned writer and director. The man is a genius. Speaking of geniuses, let's talk about Manson. I wish he had gotten that pedo instead of Sharon Tate. But let's not dwell on the negative. Let's talk about DC and how they should dominate the comic book movie world. I mean, come on, they have some of the best characters out there. And speaking of characters, let's talk about Han Solo. Harrison Ford is almost 80, people. Nobody else can be Han Solo. He's the one and only. But let's switch gears and talk about some recent movies. I saw a movie in LA last week and it was really, really good. Did they modernize the language or is it in the original language? I don't know, but it was excellent. And let's not forget about John Wick. That movie was awesome. Hitman, on the other hand, was embarrassing. But let's not dwell on the bad. Let's talk about Fifty Shades of Grey. Or should I say Fifty Shades of Red? Early reports aren't good, but who cares? It's all about the art of making a film, not a computer-generated piece of shit. See those cars? They're really cars, not a CGI addition to a green screen. See those cars crashing and flipping? They're actually cars crashing and flipping. Tell me the last time you went to the movies and not once were able to look away because you might miss something? Terminator Genysis/Marvel etc. are full of CGI. They just don't look like movies anymore. But let's not forget about the classics. There Will Be Blood? One of the most boring movies I've ever watched. My opinion, no need to convince me otherwise, it won't change my mind. Long, drawn-out story with little to no excitement. That is all. But let's talk about something more exciting, like Amy Schumer's legs. God damn, they are fantastic. And let's not forget about Eva Green. I could listen to her for days and not worry if the world was ending outside. But let's get back to the movies. The trailer for the new Ghostbusters movie was a disgrace to the game series. And don't even get me started on Batman v Superman. I hope Batman murders that fucker. In the final shot, he rips off the Affleck mask to reveal Bale. And let's not forget about Liam Neeson. That man is a legend. But let's not forget about the real legends, like Arnold Schwarzenegger. He may not be able to act, but he is an icon. He is The Terminator, so he's an obvious casting. But let's talk about something more serious, like war. Generation Kill was ok. Nothing really happens in it though. But let's not forget about the reality of war. I still liked Generation Kill, but it was a lot of the reality of the real side of war. And speaking of reality, let's talk about The Shining. I'm in the minority here, but I hated it. I had just read the book and it was very different. Kubrick butchered The Shining. The book was a masterpiece, the movie was a piece of shit. It barely touched on any of the reasons he went crazy. He froze to death compared to being killed in an explosion? Jack was great, but this meat trail of filth was a kick in the nuts to Stephen King. But let's not end on a negative note. Let's talk about something positive, like World's Fastest Indian. Anthony Hopkins nails the New Zealand accent. It's a pretty perfect performance. And let's not forget about Hugh Jackman. He's a great guy, great actor, and hasn't lost himself to Hollywood's bullshit. Even if his son's name is Oscar. And let's not forget about the fun movies, like The Italian Job. It was enjoyable and fun. Could've done without some of the emotional stuff, but overall it was well worth my time. In conclusion, movies are a wild ride. From the classics to the new releases, there's always something to talk about. And let's not forget about the actors and actresses who make these movies come to life. Emily Blunt, Chris Pratt, Lake Bell, Joel Edgerton, Liam Neeson, and so many more. They are the real deal. So let's sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.
