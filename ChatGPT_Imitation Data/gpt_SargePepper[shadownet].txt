OOC: I completely agree with Charlie. Role-playing is about creating a story and developing characters, not just rolling dice to determine outcomes. It's important to remember that in the world of Shadowrun, there are always people who are willing to take on any job for the right price. It's crucial to keep your weaknesses hidden and to always be prepared for any situation. Suede's words hit home for me. As a runner, I've seen my fair share of death and destruction. It's easy to become desensitized to it all, but we must remember that every life we take has a story and a family behind it. It's not just about completing the job, it's about the impact we have on the world around us. Dash's carefree attitude towards life is both refreshing and concerning. She's a skilled runner, but her lack of concern for her own safety could lead to her downfall. It's important to remember that we are not invincible, and that every action we take has consequences. I admire Suede's desire to improve his social skills. In the world of Shadowrun, being able to talk your way out of a situation can be just as important as being able to fight your way out. It's a skill that many runners overlook, but one that can make all the difference in a job. Dash's love for adrenaline-fueled runs is both exciting and terrifying. Chasing down another runner through a highway and an office building sounds like a recipe for disaster, but I have no doubt that she would be up for the challenge. It's important to remember that sometimes the most dangerous jobs can also be the most rewarding. The drug lord plot that Celticvengance started sounds intriguing. It's always interesting to see how different runners approach the same job, and I'm curious to see how Suede would handle it. The idea of a Grindhouse Kung-Fu run sounds like something out of a movie, but I have no doubt that Dash and the other melee-oriented runners would be up for the challenge. It's important to remember that sometimes the most unconventional jobs can also be the most fun. In the end, it's important to remember that we are all in this together. As runners, we must rely on each other to complete jobs and stay alive. We may come from different backgrounds and have different motivations, but we all share a common goal: survival.
