Yo, what's up guys? It's your boy Charlie back at it again with another rant. Today, I wanna talk about something that's been bothering me for a while now. It's about moms and their refusal to give us what we want. Specifically, in my case, it's about my mom not giving me a Pepsi. I mean, come on, mom! All I want is a Pepsi! Is that too much to ask for? I don't want anything else, just a cold, refreshing Pepsi. But no, she just had to deny me that simple pleasure. It's like she gets some sort of sick pleasure out of denying me the things I want. And it's not just me, I know you guys can relate. How many times have you asked your mom for something, only to be met with a resounding "no"? It's like they enjoy seeing us suffer. I mean, what kind of parent denies their child a simple request like a Pepsi? But you know what? I'm not gonna let my mom's refusal to give me a Pepsi bring me down. I'll just go out and get one myself. That's right, I'll take matters into my own hands. I'll go to the store, buy a Pepsi, and drink it right in front of her. That'll show her who's boss. Speaking of taking matters into your own hands, let's talk about building your own gaming PC. Now, I know some of you might be intimidated by the idea of building your own PC, but trust me, it's not as hard as it seems. And the best part? You'll save a ton of money in the long run. Sure, you could go out and buy a pre-built gaming PC from a company like Alienware, but why would you want to do that? Those things are way overpriced and often come with subpar components. If you build your own PC, you can choose exactly what components you want and get the best bang for your buck. And don't worry, you don't need to spend thousands of dollars to build a decent gaming PC. You can easily build one for around $700 that will run any game on the market. And if you're really on a budget, you can even build one for around $500 that will still be able to handle most games on low settings. But enough about gaming PCs, let's talk about games. Specifically, let's talk about recommendations. Now, I know it can be hard to recommend games to someone without knowing their tastes, but there are a few games that I think everyone should try. First off, there's Skyrim. I know, I know, it's an old game at this point, but hear me out. Even if you don't like the game itself, it can be modded into essentially a new game. Trust me, the modding community for Skyrim is insane. Another game that I think everyone should try is Minecraft. Again, I know it's an old game, but it's still incredibly popular for a reason. And like Skyrim, it can be modded into essentially a new game. If you're looking for something a bit more recent, I'd recommend Metal Gear Solid V. Now, I'll be honest, it's not the best Metal Gear game out there, but it's still a decent game. And if you're into sniping, you'll have a blast with this game. But enough about games, let's talk about something that's been bothering me lately. It's about the official servers for ARK: Survival Evolved. Now, I love this game, but the official servers are complete and utter garbage. There's lag, roving gangs of hackers, and zero support from the staff. And if bugs destroy your stuff, you're basically screwed. Not to mention the playerbase is full of some of the most toxic people I've ever encountered in a game. So, if you're thinking about playing ARK, I'd highly recommend finding a nice private server with attentive staff and a decent community. Trust me, it'll make your experience much more enjoyable. But enough about ARK, let's talk about something that's been on my mind for a while now. It's about the modding community for Final Fantasy Tactics. Now, I know what you're thinking, "Charlie, Final Fantasy Tactics is a console game, what are you doing talking about it on a PC gaming forum?" Well, my friends, Final Fantasy Tactics has found itself a modding community only possible in the PC world. And let me tell you, it's glorious. There are PC exclusive campaigns for this game that are unattainable to console peasants. So, if you're a fan of tactical RPGs, I highly recommend seeking out this modding community. You won't regret it. But enough about Final Fantasy Tactics, let's talk about something that's been bothering me lately. It's about the lack of decent capture software out there. I mean, seriously, why is it so hard to make a decent capture software? Fraps is too simple, Dxtory doesn't work for me, Afterburner and OBS make me sound like I'm broadcasting from inside of a bathroom stall, Movavi and Camtasia have issues with full screen, and Shadowplay has desync issues. It's like there's no good options out there. But you know what? I'll make do with what I have. I'll stick with Fraps, even though it has awful compression and no fun tools. At least it seems to work. And you know what else? I'll make do with my mom's refusal to give me a Pepsi. I'll go out and get one myself, and I'll enjoy it even more knowing that I took matters into my own hands. That's the spirit of PC gaming, taking control and making things happen. So, in conclusion, moms, give us our damn Pepsi. And gamers, build your own damn PC. And developers, make some damn good capture software. That's all I have to say for now. Peace out, guys.
