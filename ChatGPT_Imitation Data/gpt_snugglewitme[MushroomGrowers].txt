Hey there fellow mycology enthusiasts! I hope everyone is doing well and having success with their grows. I wanted to give an update on my latest grow using the WBS spawn method. First off, I have to say that I have been feeling under the weather lately. I've been experiencing a lot of sneezing, an itchy throat, coughing, and a stuffy head. I don't feel very achy, but I have been getting headaches from all the coughing and sneezing. I'm not sure if it's allergies or a cold, but either way, it's been making things a bit more difficult. Despite feeling sick, I have been able to continue with my grow. I used a 3:1 cocoa coir substrate to spawn ratio, with a half of a small brick of coco coir, about a cup of coffee grounds, and a teaspoon of calcium chloride (pickling lime). I mixed it all up in a 5-gallon bucket, poured 11 cups of boiling water on top, put the lid on, waited 10 minutes, opened it, stirred it around, and resealed it. I waited about an hour for it to cool before putting 3 quarts (about 5 big spoonfuls) of the substrate in a tub lined with a black trash bag that was previously rubbed down with ISO alcohol. I added 2 of my pint jars (1 quart of WBS inoculated spawn) into the 6-quart tubs, mixed it all up, covered it with aluminum foil, poked 4 holes for ventilation, and covered it with micro pore tape. I've been growing mine in a giant styrofoam cooler I found at work, which they were throwing away. It's sitting in the dining room in the corner with a heating mat/thermostat in it. I have to say, it's been working pretty well so far. One thing I did notice was some weird yellowy splotches on the bottom left of the tub. Other than that, it looks nice. I'm not sure what caused the splotches, but I'm hoping it's not a sign of contamination. I did have a fever last night, so I'm pretty sure I'm just dealing with a cold or something more sinister. I'm hoping it doesn't affect my grow too much. In terms of the process, I followed the WBS spawn TEK pretty closely. I used a half-pint jar of WBS and inoculated it with a general mushroom spore syringe. I sterilized 8 jars, noc'd up 6 jars, and used the other 2 as control jars. I wanted to make sure I did everything correctly up until I noc'd them up, only because I'm still pretty new to this. As of day 5, the control jars look contamination-free, which is a good sign. I've heard that LC is hard to tell if it has any contaminants floating around in it, so I'll make sure to test it before I try a full production. I used 300ml of distilled water and 1 tablespoon of Karo to make my liquid culture jar. I've been incubating it for a few days now, but I'm not sure how to tell when it's done growing. I do see the spores at the top of the water are sorta growing, but will the top of the water be completely overgrown with mycelium? Once my jars are 100% done and I'm ready to start fruiting them, I'm not sure if I need to dunk the cakes in water for 24 hours and roll them in a casing before trying to fruit them, or if I just take the cakes out of the jars and put them in a fruiting chamber. If anyone has any advice on this, I would greatly appreciate it. I've been incubating my jars at around 79 degrees Fahrenheit using a big styrofoam cooler I found at work. I put my jars in shoe boxes and place those shoe boxes on top of a heat mat inside the cooler. I've read that the inside of jars is usually warmer because of the growing process, so I'm hoping this temperature is okay. I've been having a lot of fun with this hobby, and I feel like I'm actually kinda getting the hang of it. I seem to be doing all these sterilization steps and prep steps very smoothly without having to look back at the teks or anything. It's kinda nice. I feel like I'm learning, which is awesome. If anyone has any tips or advice for a newbie like me, I would greatly appreciate it. I'm still learning and trying to figure things out, but I'm excited to see where this hobby takes me. Also, I wanted to give a shoutout to a fellow mycology enthusiast who sent me a print. Thank you so much! I would gladly accept another one if you're willing to send it. I'm trying my hand at this hobby of mycology, and I need a sample to start with. This would help a lot with me trying to jumpstart this hobby, and I'll definitely pay it forward if you send me one. In terms of my next grow, I was thinking of trying to grow oyster mushrooms. I've been researching a lot of what I'll need and such, but I'm kinda scared I'll mess it up. If anyone has any advice or tips on growing oyster mushrooms, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks for reading, and happy growing!
