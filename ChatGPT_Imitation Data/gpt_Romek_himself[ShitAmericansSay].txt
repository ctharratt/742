Well, well, well, looks like we have another American trying to defend their country's honor. Let me tell you, as a German, I have no interest in American football or baseball. No TV channel or newspaper in Germany has ever supported these sports. They are just not interesting to us. And let's be real, outside of the US, no one cares about the Kardashians or Kanye West. Americans need to realize that they are not the center of the universe. And don't even get me started on the so-called "freedom" in the US. The guy said "free" and not "freedom," but even then, the US is not the most free nation. Just look at the Native Americans who still have to live in reservations and are not allowed to speak their own language in school. And let's not forget that the US has 25% of all prisoners in the world combined. Sacrifices made? More like damn pathetic Americans. And let's talk about the US's involvement in wars. They only went to war when Germany was already defeated in WWII, just to seize landmass because Soviet Russia was going to overrun complete Europe. The US would have lost all the money they made in WWII and all the debts. And let's not forget that the US sold weapons to all sides during the war, while others bled. And don't even get me started on the treatment of minorities in the US. When you don't have papers in the US, cops can fuck you very hard, and that's normal everywhere in the world. When officials ask you who you are, you have to identify, even on airports, hospitals, banks, or whatever. And why doesn't the US use drones against gang members? Some gangs in the US are as big as ISIS. And let's talk about Trump. He says people from a special religion are less worth than others. Outside of the US, no one cares for it. It's the same way the US cares for soccer. And let's not forget that the US bombed the Middle East into oblivion and mass murdered these people so they have to run for their life. It's not the Muslims who are the assholes; it's the USA & co. And let's not forget about the environment. When US Americans are done with the continent and fracked it to shit, burned California in a gas cloud, poisoned the population with toxic water, spread cancer with nuclear waste (St. Louis), and GMO food, they will have made the US the next Mad Max world. But we Germans will still be here, strong as ever. And let's talk about language. Americans don't even have their own language to begin with. Europeans don't care. All the options are shit, but at least they are not OUR options. And let's not forget that hate speech is not allowed in Germany. It is allowed to discuss everything, but there is a big difference between discussing and spitting out pure hate on people. You don't have true freedom of speech when you cannot accept how other people handle it. We Germans just don't allow Nazi low brains to spread their hating bullshit. We had this already 75 years ago and learned our lessons. We don't need US cowboys to teach us something about "freedom." And let's not forget about history. We Germans stopped the Romans 2000 years ago. We had Napoleon on his march to Russia. Our country got bombed to the ground in WWI and WWII, and we came back stronger than before. We will still be here and strong when the US is a thing of the past. So, to sum it up, Americans need to realize that they are not the center of the universe. They need to stop thinking that they are the most free nation and start treating minorities and the environment with respect. And let's not forget that hate speech is not allowed in Germany, and we don't need US cowboys to teach us about "freedom." We Germans will still be here, strong as ever, when the US is a thing of the past.
