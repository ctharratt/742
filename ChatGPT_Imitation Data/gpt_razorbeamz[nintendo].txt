Alright, let's talk about something that's been bothering me for a while now. It's the issue of localization in video games, specifically when it comes to dialogue. I've seen a lot of people defend the practice of writing over dialogue with nothing but "..." and I just can't understand it. To me, that's not localization, it's laziness. Now, I understand that there are limitations when it comes to translating dialogue from one language to another. Sometimes certain phrases or jokes just don't translate well, and it can be difficult to find an equivalent that works in the target language. But that's not an excuse to just leave the dialogue blank or with ellipses. I've seen this happen in a lot of games, but one recent example that comes to mind is the localization of Fire Emblem Fates. In the Japanese version of the game, there's a character named Soleil who is attracted to women. However, in the English version, her dialogue was changed so that she's attracted to "cute boys and girls." This change was made because the original dialogue was seen as potentially offensive to some players. Now, I understand why this change was made. It's important to be sensitive to different cultures and beliefs, and to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes. But the problem is that instead of finding a way to translate the original dialogue in a way that works in English, the localization team just changed it completely. And in doing so, they erased an important aspect of the character's identity. This is just one example, but I've seen similar things happen in other games as well. And it's not just a matter of changing dialogue to avoid offending people. Sometimes, dialogue is changed simply because the localization team thinks it sounds better or is more "natural" in the target language. But the thing is, what sounds natural in one language might not sound natural in another. And by changing the dialogue, you're not just altering the words on the screen, you're altering the entire tone and feel of the game. This can be especially frustrating for fans who are familiar with the original version of the game and feel like they're not getting the same experience in the localized version. Now, I'm not saying that localization is a bad thing. In fact, I think it's incredibly important. Without localization, many games would never make it to other countries, and players around the world would miss out on some truly amazing experiences. But I do think that there needs to be a better balance between staying true to the original version of the game and making it accessible to players in other countries. One solution could be to include multiple language options in the game, so that players can choose to play with the original dialogue if they prefer. This is something that's becoming more common in games these days, and I think it's a step in the right direction. Another solution could be to involve the original creators of the game in the localization process. This would ensure that the tone and feel of the game are preserved, while still making it accessible to players in other countries. Of course, this would require more time and resources, but I think it would be worth it in the end. At the end of the day, I just want to see more care and attention given to the localization process. I want to see games that are accessible to players around the world, but that also stay true to the original vision of the creators. And I want to see dialogue that's more than just "..." or completely changed to fit a different culture. Localization is a difficult and complex process, but I believe that with the right approach, it can be done in a way that benefits everyone involved. So let's work together to make sure that we're getting the best possible versions of our favorite games, no matter where we live.
