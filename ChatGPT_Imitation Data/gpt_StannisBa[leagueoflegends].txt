Alright, let's talk about the state of League of Legends and the different regions. First off, let me just say that NA is objectively the worst major region right now. I know some of you fanboys out there might not want to hear it, but it's the truth. Just look at the records and the quality of games. It's a joke of a region right now where a team like Immortals, who have four overrated players, can dominate the league, or a team like CLG, who had one good player (Doublelift), could win NA. Now, let's compare NA to other regions. China is still a better region than NA. They have four teams that are good right now, while NA has none. I mean, maybe by Worlds NA will have three good teams (like TSM, TL, and NRG or something), but right now it's just sad. LGD is a bottom tier team in LPL right now, while TSM is a top 4 NA team. And let's not forget that C9, with Hai, lost to a 3-day-old H2K and went 2-2 at Worlds 2015. It's just embarrassing. And don't even get me started on the quality of games in NA. It's just sloppy and uncoordinated. The games are longer than any other region in a fast-game meta. It's just painful to watch sometimes. And the bottom of the barrel teams in NA are just laughable. REN, FOX, DIG, and TiP? Come on, these teams are not even close to mid-tier NA teams like CLG and TL (although TL can get better, and C9 has potential with Hai). Now, let's talk about other regions. Korea is obviously the strongest region right now. They have the best players, the best teams, and the best infrastructure. It's just a fact. China is still a strong region, although they have had some struggles lately. They have some really good teams like EDG, RNG, and QG. Europe is also a strong region, with teams like G2, H2K, and Fnatic. And let's not forget about the LMS, which has some really strong teams like Flash Wolves and AHQ. But let's talk about some specific teams and players. First off, let's talk about LGD. No, LGD is not a good team right now. They lost Homme and Chris and had to use Firefox as "coach". Then Pyl tilted off the face of the earth and couldn't lead the team. And let's not forget that they had sloppier games than any other region at Worlds 2015. It's just sad to see a team that was once so dominant fall so far. And let's talk about some players. Season 3 Tabzz is not the same as Season 4 Tabzz. Koro1 at S5 Worlds is not the same as Spring Split/MSI Koro1. Aphromoo and Darshan are not as good as people make them out to be. And Xmithie has been downgraded, although I will admit that RO got fucked by Bengi. And let's not forget that RO is not better than Clearlove, he was just carried by Riot being retarded. Now, let's talk about some specific games. QG was underperforming heavily versus DIG. It was just painful to watch. And Worlds 2015 was a joke. The games were sloppy and uncoordinated, and it was just not fun to watch. And let's not forget about TiP. TiP is not even a real team! They are just a bunch of players thrown together. Neither of those teams are close to the clusterfuck that TiP is. And let's talk about some memes. Cyka Blyat is just a meme at this point, barely any Russians say that phrase. And Lustboy is a top 3 defensive support of all time and played like it at Summer 2014 and Spring 2015 when he was hard carrying TSM. And let's not forget about the "Uzi like the gun" meme. Everyone said Uzi like the gun at S3 Worlds, then the amateur LPLEN casters said that it should be pronounced U-Z-I, then Kobe at S4 supposedly asked Uzi which one is correct. And finally, let's talk about some random stuff. Poland was owned by the USSR, but it was just a puppet state which means it governed itself. And many Poles still speak fluent Russian because they were part of the USSR and had to learn it. And let's not forget that MonteCristo was plat, but that doesn't really matter because there's not a big difference between plat and silver. And let's not forget that Smeb is one of the few players who stays at a high level once they got to a high level. In conclusion, NA is objectively the worst major region right now. The quality of games is just sloppy and uncoordinated, and the bottom of the barrel teams are just laughable. Other regions like Korea, China, Europe, and the LMS are all stronger than NA right now. And let's not forget about specific teams and players, memes, and random stuff. It's just a crazy world we live in.
