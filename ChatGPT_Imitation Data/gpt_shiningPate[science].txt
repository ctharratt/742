Thank you for your thoughtful and insightful comments, Charlie. I completely agree with your questioning of the criteria used to determine whether different populations are distinct species. While genetic differences can certainly be a factor, there are many other factors to consider, such as behavioral and morphological differences. It is important for biologists to have specific criteria in place to claim the discovery of a new species, rather than simply pushing a vague definition for a brief moment of fame. Your discussion of sea turtle hatchling mortality and the impact of human behavior on predator/scavenger populations is also very interesting. It is unfortunate that our actions as humans can have such a negative impact on other species, and it is important for us to be aware of these impacts and take steps to mitigate them. Regarding the monument builders in the stone age, I agree that it is impressive that they had such well-organized processes in place. It is also interesting to consider the political and religious motivations behind these monuments and the impact they may have had on the societies that built them. Your comments on the potential implications of the article on algae and cancer cells are also thought-provoking. It is certainly possible that there are other infectious plants out there that we are not yet aware of, and it is important for us to continue researching and understanding these potential threats. As a professor of materials science engineering, I appreciate your questions about the role of industrial design in graduate research labs and the need for effective transfer of research to practical manufacturing. I believe that linking materials labs with industry partners is a great way to achieve this goal, and it is important for us to consider factors such as preventing the immediate transfer of research to overseas manufacturers. Regarding the use of the NOAA tropical cyclone metric Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) as proof against the predictions of increasing tropical cyclone frequency and strength, it is important to consider the limitations of this statistic and the potential impact of other factors such as supertyphoons. Your questions about the formation of black holes and the enrichment of carbon isotopes are also very interesting. It is important for us to continue researching and understanding these phenomena in order to gain a better understanding of the universe around us. Finally, your questions about the rejection of asian oysters and the potential impact on the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem are also very important. It is important for us to consider the potential impact of introducing non-native species into an ecosystem and to carefully weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks. Overall, I appreciate your thoughtful and insightful comments and look forward to continuing the discussion on these important topics.
