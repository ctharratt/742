Well, Charlie, I have to say that I disagree with you on a few points. First of all, just because businesses don't volunteer anything doesn't mean that individuals can't volunteer their time or resources to help others. In fact, many businesses do participate in charitable activities and donate to causes they believe in. Secondly, while it may be true that fast food restaurants can't always prevent people from using their bathrooms, that doesn't mean they can't turn down requests to use them. It's up to the individual restaurant to decide whether or not they want to allow non-customers to use their facilities. As for Reddit, I don't think it's fair to say that we are the product and the advertisers are the customers. Yes, Reddit does make money from advertising, but that doesn't mean that the users are being exploited. We are still able to use the site for free and engage with others in a community that we enjoy. You also mentioned that if something is worth our time, it's worth our money. While that may be true in some cases, it's not always the case. For example, I may enjoy using Reddit, but that doesn't mean I have the financial means to support it. And just because I don't pay for it doesn't mean I don't value it. Furthermore, I don't think it's fair to compare using Reddit to buying beer or gasoline. Those are physical products that we consume, whereas Reddit is a digital platform that we use to connect with others. It's not the same thing. You also mentioned that voluntarism doesn't exist and that my argument is conjecture. While it's true that voluntarism may not be a perfect system, it's still a valid philosophy that many people believe in. And just because we don't have a perfect example of it in practice doesn't mean it's not worth considering. Finally, I don't think it's fair to say that centralized governments work and that business thrives under such systems. There are plenty of examples of corrupt governments and businesses that exploit their workers and the environment. And just because something has worked in the past doesn't mean it will continue to work in the future. In conclusion, while I appreciate your perspective, I don't think it's fair to make sweeping generalizations about complex issues like voluntarism and the role of government and business in society. We need to consider all sides of the argument and work towards finding solutions that benefit everyone, not just a select few.
