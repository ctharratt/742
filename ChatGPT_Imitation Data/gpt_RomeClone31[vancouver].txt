Depends how big the TV was, blind optimism is admirable. Now that homeless guy that was in my parkcade when I left for work can check twitter and Facebook. We are Canada. Let's keep it light. Who really cares about the metro news? Yes, but in Chinese. Just be happy our street signs and speed limit signs are still in English. For now anyway. If this surprises anyone, you haven't been in Vancouver very long. Get out of here Langley. Right, but we don't have to. That's the point. They aren't entitled to that. Just give the bully your lunch money and he won't punch you in the face, right? Flawed logic. We have RIGHTS! Same ole same ole. One set of rules for the pigs, another set of rules for the rest of us. Frustrating as hell. You can get good drip coffee anywhere else for the same price. Save your tastebuds from this crappy coffee! Corny ass post. Do not downvote this. It's the only funny thing on this whole damn thread. Fuck you, pay me. "Keyboard warriors wait in silence to be offended and chastise someone who is less moral than yee." It's watering. It's a huge loss of treated water from our system, which is why it's easily the obvious victim of the restrictions. One watering session is roughly 50 loads of laundry worth of water. Maybe they should lay off the day drinking. This should be more about the good man than the loser. Losers are everywhere. Good men are not. This is more entertaining than any CFL game....ever. Come to my house, I'll make you grilled cheese and a sidekick. Fair point of view, I completely disagree. Government is a microcosm of the voters, so theoretically going to the voters is the purest way to represent your constituents. You might not like the result, or even as you did question the amount of information used in the decision, but I still prefer that to having awful decisions (as I believe a yes vote would have been) shoved down our throats with no say at all. If we just keep swapping parties that piss us off then we are all worse off. This was regional....and in my opinion worked perfectly. It's nice actually having a voice rather than just having to stomach a string of poor decisions until another election. I'm starting one to buy myself a nice seafood dinner with Dorothy Mantooth. I agree with this. People just want to bitch without ever addressing the issues. I don't see how turning a decision like this over to the voters in a democracy is politics. Isn't this what a democracy is? Not everyone is happy and never will be, but hey, Democracy. Welcome to the internet partner. Says you. The majority disagree. Doesn't make you smarter, it makes you wrong. Message sent assholes. Thanks for wasting almost 8 million for nothing. Edit-I knew this would get downvoted but the people have spoken! #Win. It's about allegations against one man's conduct. That's all. I don't see how it's excusing anything. You can't indict someone on moral hindsight. The world was different. Agree with you completely. You're a dick, but that's funny. A fucking seagull tried to fly into my apartment to escape it. I think she really thought we would all smile and be happy about this. Instead, she got one large groan. Ridiculously Vancouver. Embarrassing as hell. Yes, and the airlines will start giving u a stack of 20's for flight delays. Get fucking serious. Life happens. Shit happens. You deal with it like everyone else. Or more importantly, when will he have more options? A partisan system is laughable democracy. I will never vote for a shitty party because I'm angry with another shitty party. That's just ignorant. Fucking embarrassing. Who seriously thought this was a good idea? Love this. Bang on! Well said my friend. "What about us?"-- chill dudes dealing with obnoxiously hammered and aggressive women. I'm not really going to disagree with you, I knew that when he said it. Too bad more Vancouverites didn't. Love that entire response. Let's be friends. Just like he is going to "end homelessness by 2015," this is a bunch of idealistic rhetoric. Productive chat champ. Good reddit argument. Lol. VPD are hilarious. For once I agree with the Mayor. For once. They will be terminated the second due process has been afforded. Cameras are the bad cops' new worst enemy! Fuck these power-hungry, entitled, arrogant pieces of shit. We will be bullied no more. That's a fairly broad assumption. Fully agree with this as well. Other major cities have very similar transit projects that are all within current budgets. Some people are also offended by the 7 million wasted by the yes side in promotions. Surrey's rookie mayor also talked herself into a corner admitting they were only taking down "No" signs because it "isn't an election" -That's dirty pool. Fucking right. They will find another way to fuck us. But why fuck ourselves? (3 on the fuck counter. Edit: as usual, anything supporting the NO vote is downvoted into oblivion. How dare I love where I live.....I should move somewhere ugly and shitty and be miserable to appease the other miserable fucks. Yah, I love my hometown. So what? That's a pretty weak example. And I live on that street. I seriously have no idea what that means, especially in regards to a geographical location. Which major city is innocent of said charges? Vancouver has moved beyond being self-conscious about how we are viewed. We know who we are now. 2010 was our maturation. Vancouver Baby. Home sweet home. I actually had to look up the spelling. Agreed. Well thought out. For the record, I voted NO simply because I am opposed to regional taxation. Perfectly acceptable point of view, but so is his. You mentioned a user pay system, how dare you promote capitalism in a capitalist society! :P Also known as traffic fatality week! Stay safe out there! Pretty sure you're completely wrong about that. Oh awesome, you mean the service that is fucked and not working is free? Wow! Great fucking news! Finally, someone who understands. Translink doing Translink things. Typical. Edit: Damn all you bus-riding, broke-ass redditors and your Translink boners. Who is this "guy"? No one will be busted unless they are blatant and stupid about it. Did I live below you once? Banning smoking is only as effective as enforcement. Which is to say not effective at all. Especially in a new building. Don't see how this is surprising at all. It won't be to anyone who lives downtown like myself. Vancouver could stand to be flat for a while... The arrogance here is insane. No emergency lights of any kind in poor weather. Causing multiple near misses. Fucking prick. Jesus fucking Christ, reddit police. Why do you give a shit about my up or down votes? I posted that on the fly and could give a fuck. Some people in reddit are fucking nazis, and evidently you're one of them. It's just a time fill bro. And his name isn't borrows. Guess which city they play in?! Burr has been their best skater. All heart. And the rest of the hockey world absolutely hates him! Which I love! Can we just give Surrey to the states? It's turning into fucking Detroit. It's called a free market.
