Yo, what's up fellow TF2 players? It's your boy, Charlie, back at it again with some thoughts on the game. Today, I want to talk about the importance of strategy and surprise in TF2 gameplay. Now, we all know that TF2 is a game that requires skill and teamwork to win. But sometimes, even the most skilled players can fall victim to a well-planned surprise attack. That's where strategy comes in. And let me tell you, I've been using a certain strategy to rack up 99% uber and then hide, so that when the enemy team pushes, they don't expect it. It's a sneaky move, but it works like a charm. Of course, there are some giveaways to my strategy. The "I AM FULLY CHARGED!" callout from the Medic can give away my position, but it's a risk I'm willing to take. And let's be real, sometimes the enemy team is just too focused on pushing to even notice the callout. But here's the thing, some people on the Steam Community use the Artwork area for- and this might seem shocking- art. I think they need to make a separate section for these kinds of posts, so that those of us who want to discuss gameplay strategies and tactics can do so without getting lost in a sea of fan art. Speaking of tactics, have you guys noticed how almost every good, scary cosmetic is for the Pyro? I mean, don't get me wrong, the Pyro is a great class, but I'd love to wear something like that on the Spy. Just imagine decloaking behind an enemy and the last thing they see is... that face. It's enough to give anyone nightmares. Now, I know that some of you might be thinking, "But Charlie, TF2 is just a game, why do you take it so seriously?" And to that, I say, "Why not?" Sure, TF2 is a game, but it's also a community. And in any community, there are those who take things more seriously than others. For me, TF2 is more than just a game, it's a passion. And I know I'm not alone in that. But let's not forget that TF2 is also meant to be fun. And that's why I love the Hellstone map. Sure, it has its flaws, but it's a "for-fun" map. Valve isn't exactly going to make Hellstone a competitive-mode map, so there's no need to get all worked up about it. Let's just enjoy the map for what it is. And while we're on the topic of Valve, can we all take a moment to remember that TF2 was also multi-platform? Valve just went ahead and dumped support for that shortly after release. So the point about cross-platform isn't really a good arguing point until we see how much support they intend to give, or for how long. Now, let's talk about some gameplay tips. Have you ever wondered why your points went up so slowly on Gorge? Well, wonder no more. It turns out that the HHH contract can be obtained while on Hellstone, but not on Eyeaduct. So if you want to kill HHH, go to Hellstone, since he always dies there. And if you want to take on Monoculus, go to Eyeaduct, since he always dies there for me, but never ever on Hellstone (probably because it spawns two...). And speaking of gameplay tips, have you guys ever had trouble with the item server? I know I have. But fear not, my friends, for there is a solution. The ClientRegistry.blob trick has been working for years. Pretty much if any problem happens relating to Steam, deleting that and restarting Steam fixes it 9 times out of ten. However, in recent months, it has gone from upwards of 8mb to 1kb (rounded up). Infact, mine seems to have disappeared entirely as of about a week ago. So if you're having trouble with the item server, give that trick a try. Now, let's talk about some of the more... interesting aspects of TF2. Have you guys seen the NSFW tag on some posts? It's good to see that someone is using it properly. And have you seen some of the amazing artwork that people have created using TF2 characters? It's truly awe-inspiring. But let's not forget about the memes. Who can forget the classic "DUCKS ARE IN THE JOHN" meme? And let's not forget about the "TRUMPETS INTENSIFY" meme. They may be silly, but they're a part of the TF2 community, and that's what makes them great. And finally, let's talk about the importance of community servers. Sure, Valve servers are great, but there's something special about playing on a community server. You get to know the regulars, you get to try out new maps and game modes, and you get to experience TF2 in a whole new way. So if you haven't tried playing on a community server yet, I highly recommend it. Well, that's all for now, folks. I hope you've enjoyed my thoughts on TF2 gameplay. Remember, strategy and surprise are key to winning, but at the end of the day, TF2 is meant to be fun. So let's enjoy the game, the community, and all the memes that come with it.
