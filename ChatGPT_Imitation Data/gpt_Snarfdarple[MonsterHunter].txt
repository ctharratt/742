Hey there fellow Monster Hunter fans! It's been a while since I've posted anything related to the game, but fear not, I'm still working on my comic. It's just moving a bit slow at the moment. I did base it off the rune for antekka though, so at least there's some progress being made. On a side note, I recently googled "gyftrot" and let me tell you, I'm not sleeping tonight. But hey, I get the feeling that Kim might be willing to part with hers. Maybe the commissioner wrote the wrong name? I just based it off a low resolution screen grab I was given. I thought it kind of resembled Seltas parts, but I'm not really familiar with glaives. Either way, I ended up simplifying it to the point of no recognition. It was supposed to be an abounding Dalamadur, but I kind of struggled with the weapon's unusual shape and the dynamic angle. Currently, I'm playing 3U and trying to get those plesioth heads. It's funny how the game has changed over the years. I remember playing the very first Monster Hunter and falling for the old tricks like the fishy quest. His nose didn't flash in old MH and it hit way harder than it does in 4. I only fell for it one time, but we almost triple carted. Anyway, enough about my gaming experiences. Let's talk about commissions. I'm currently out of free slots, but I do take commissions. It all depends on what you're looking for. Sketch, line art, basic color, detailed color? Let me know what you're looking for, and we can figure out a price. Shoot me a message if you're interested in a commission. I accept payments through PayPal. If you're looking for more of my work, I don't have an official site right now, but I do post all my work to my DeviantArt and Tumblr pages. I made a post a few weeks ago and took the requests of the first five people to post in the comments. Currently, I'm booked on freebies, but I do commissions too! Speaking of gaming, I recently started playing the original Monster Hunter again. It's great by 2004 standards, but it's definitely not as polished as the newer games. The reviews were mostly about the first 15 minutes of gameplay, but just wait until you fight the gold one. She had me cursing up a storm that would've made a sailor blush. As for my comic, I'm still working on it, but it's taking way longer than I expected. I plan on one of my characters remaining a dedicated gunlancer once she reaches that point in the story. The same might not be said for the other characters. I like to pretend my characters have some dignity, so I'll dress them respectfully. I've also been getting a lot of requests for left-handed weapons in the game. Actually, there are multiple left-handed weapons in the games like sword and shield and charge blade. So, for all you lefties out there, fear not! One of my favorite moments in the game was getting four carts in a single quest in Monster Hunter Freedom 1. There's a long cutscene before fighting Crimson Fatalis, and you really don't realize that the cutscene is over until the moment the bastard swoops down and kills all of you instantaneously. Good times. Life's been busy, but I'm working on my comic when I can. I owe a few people requests from quite some time ago, so I need to follow through on those eventually. It's tough to balance everything, but I'm doing my best. Well, that's all for now. Keep on hunting, fellow hunters!
