I'm with Canada, not with stupid. That's a sentiment that every major world religion can get behind. And it's a sentiment that I think a lot of Americans are feeling right now, as we watch the circus that is the 2016 presidential election. On the one hand, we have Donald Trump, a man who seems to be running for president as a joke. He says outrageous things, insults entire groups of people, and seems to have no real plan for how he would govern if he were actually elected. On the other hand, we have a group of candidates who are more traditional politicians, but who are also deeply flawed in their own ways. Take Hillary Clinton, for example. She's been in politics for decades, and she's certainly qualified to be president. But she's also been involved in a number of scandals, from Benghazi to her use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State. And she's seen as being too cozy with Wall Street, which is a major concern for many voters. Then there's Bernie Sanders, who has energized a lot of young people with his message of social democracy. He's calling for free college education, universal healthcare, and a higher minimum wage. But he's also seen as being too far to the left to win a general election, and he's been criticized for not having a clear plan for how he would pay for all of his proposals. So where does that leave us? Well, it leaves us with a lot of uncertainty. We don't know who the next president will be, and we don't know what kind of policies they'll pursue. But one thing is clear: whoever wins, they'll have a lot of work to do. One of the biggest challenges facing the next president will be healthcare. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has been a major source of controversy since it was passed in 2010. Republicans have been trying to repeal it ever since, and even some Democrats have criticized it for not going far enough. Bernie Sanders has called for a single-payer healthcare system, similar to what they have in Canada. Under this system, the government would be responsible for providing healthcare to all citizens, and private insurance companies would be eliminated. This would be a major change from the current system, and it's not clear how it would be paid for. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, has called for building on the Affordable Care Act. She wants to expand Medicaid, reduce the cost of prescription drugs, and increase access to mental health services. She's also called for a public option, which would allow people to buy into a government-run insurance plan. Donald Trump has been less clear about his healthcare plans. He's called for repealing Obamacare, but he hasn't said what he would replace it with. He's also said that he would allow insurance companies to sell policies across state lines, which he says would increase competition and lower costs. Another major issue facing the next president will be the economy. The United States has been recovering from the Great Recession, but there are still a lot of people who are struggling. Wages have been stagnant for years, and income inequality is at an all-time high. Bernie Sanders has called for a $15 minimum wage, which he says would help lift millions of people out of poverty. He's also called for breaking up the big banks, which he says are too powerful and too risky. And he's called for free college education, which he says would help young people get the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century economy. Hillary Clinton has also called for raising the minimum wage, although she hasn't specified a dollar amount. She's also called for increasing access to affordable childcare, which she says would help working families. And she's called for investing in infrastructure, which she says would create jobs and boost the economy. Donald Trump has called for cutting taxes and reducing regulations, which he says would stimulate economic growth. He's also called for renegotiating trade deals, which he says would help bring jobs back to the United States. There are, of course, many other issues facing the next president. Climate change, immigration, national security, and education are just a few of the topics that will need to be addressed. And whoever wins the election will need to work with Congress to get things done. So where does that leave us? Well, it leaves us with a lot of uncertainty. But it also leaves us with a lot of hope. The United States is a great country, and we've faced challenges before. We've always come out stronger on the other side. So let's not give up hope. Let's keep fighting for what we believe in. Let's keep working to make this country a better place for everyone. And let's remember that, no matter who wins the election, we're all in this together.
