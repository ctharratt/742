Alright, let's talk wrestling. Specifically, let's talk about the recent rumors and news surrounding the WWE and other promotions. First up, the potential multi-man match at WrestleMania featuring the Dudleys, Usos, Lucha Dragons, and New Day. Personally, I'm excited for this match. It's always fun to see a bunch of talented wrestlers in the ring at once, and these teams have all proven themselves to be entertaining and skilled. Plus, it's WrestleMania - the biggest event of the year for wrestling fans. Of course, there are always those who will complain about anything and everything the WWE does, but I think this match has the potential to be a highlight of the show. Speaking of WrestleMania, there's been a lot of talk about Brock Lesnar's involvement in the event. Some fans are tired of seeing him in the main event, but I have to disagree. Lesnar is a legitimate superstar and a draw for the company. Plus, he always puts on a great show in the ring. As for the "People here shit on TNA" comment, I think it's unfair to generalize all wrestling fans like that. Sure, there are some who only watch WWE, but there are plenty of us who enjoy other promotions as well. Moving on to the recent episode of Raw, I have to say I was disappointed with the outcome of the Styles Clash kick out. It's a move that has been protected for years, and to see it kicked out of so easily was a letdown. However, I'm still excited to see what AJ Styles can do in the WWE. He's a talented wrestler with a lot of potential, and I think he'll be a great addition to the roster. As for the Wyatt Family, I agree that they need a win at Fastlane. They've been on a losing streak lately, and it's time for them to make a statement. I'm not sure if they'll win in under five minutes like the Shield did to the Outlaws, but I do think they need a convincing victory to reestablish themselves as a dominant force in the WWE. Moving on to other promotions, let's talk about Lucha Underground. It's a fantastic show with some of the most talented wrestlers in the world. I'm always impressed by the high-flying, fast-paced action in the ring. And with over 200,000 viewers a week, it's clear that I'm not the only one who enjoys it. I do wonder how big the fan base is, though. It seems like everyone who watches it loves it, but I'm not sure how many people that actually is. And speaking of Lucha Underground, I have to say I'm excited for the upcoming AMA with Matt Striker. He's a controversial figure in the wrestling world, but I think he's a talented commentator and I'm interested to hear what he has to say. Of course, there are always those who will criticize anything and everything, but I think it's important to give people a chance to speak their minds. Moving on to NXT, I have to say I'm excited for the upcoming Women's Championship reign. Bayley has been an incredible champion, but it's time for someone else to step up and take the title. Personally, I'm rooting for Asuka. She's a fantastic wrestler with a unique style, and I think she would make a great champion. And finally, let's talk about the recent rumors surrounding the Bullet Club. It's been reported that Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson will be joining the WWE soon, and I have to say I'm excited for that. They're both incredibly talented wrestlers with a lot of experience, and I think they'll be a great addition to the roster. As for AJ Styles, it's unclear what his future holds. He's hinted that he may be joining the WWE as well, but nothing has been confirmed yet. Either way, I'm excited to see what the future holds for these talented wrestlers. Overall, I think it's an exciting time to be a wrestling fan. There are so many talented wrestlers and promotions out there, and it's great to see them all thriving. Of course, there will always be those who complain and criticize, but I think it's important to focus on the positives and enjoy the show. After all, that's what wrestling is all about - entertainment and excitement.
