Hey there, folks! Charlie here, back with some more words of wisdom for all of you out there. Today, I want to talk about finding friends on the internet and why it might not be the best idea. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you can't make friends online. In fact, I've made some great friends through various online communities over the years. However, there are some things you need to be careful about when it comes to sharing personal information with strangers on the internet. One of the biggest mistakes people make is giving out their full name. This might not seem like a big deal, but it can actually give someone a lot of information about you. For example, if someone has your full name, they can easily find you on Facebook. From there, they can see pictures of your apartment complex and even your room number if you've posted about it. This might not seem like a big deal, but it can be incredibly dangerous. There are a lot of scumbags out there who would love nothing more than to take advantage of someone who has given them access to this kind of information. So, my advice to you is to be careful about what you share online. Don't give out your full name or any other personal information that could be used to track you down. Now, let's move on to a different topic. Recently, someone asked for recommendations on where to live. They wanted somewhere warm with something going on, but not in the middle of nowhere. They asked for people's favorite places to live. Well, let me tell you, this changes everything. If you're not tied to a specific location for work or family reasons, then the world is your oyster. You can live anywhere you want! So, where should you go? First of all, let's talk about the warm part. If you want to live somewhere warm, then you need to look at a map of the United States. Find Los Angeles and draw a horizontal line from there east. Anywhere below that line will be warm 11 months out of the year. So, you've got a lot of options there. Now, let's talk about the "something going on" part. If you want to live somewhere with a lot of activity, then you need to avoid certain states. Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Lakeland, FL are not the places you want to be. Any other city in the United States will have something "going on." And that "something" will most likely be complaining that it's hot 11 months out of the year. So, based on your criteria and my personal knowledge from traveling, I would suggest staying in Canada. My lady and I moved here in February and we're both in our mid-twenties. She has her Bachelor's degree and hasn't found work yet. We've gone to the beach about four times, but I'm over it. Traffic, humidity, and crime are all issues here. There are lovely places all over this country, but unless you're a tourist, Orlando is not one of them. Moving on to a different topic, have you ever seen those videos advertising events that look amazing, but then you go to the event and it's nothing like the video? Yeah, me too. I recently saw a video for a concert that looked incredible, but I was skeptical. In what way does that video advertise the event? I was hoping for some actual footage of past concerts. My advice to the event organizers is to link to this thread next time and maybe they'll reconsider. People want to know what they're getting into before they spend their hard-earned money on tickets. Finally, I want to talk about something that really grinds my gears. People who don't do what I consider the obligatory "wave" to people who let them into their lane. Seriously, what's up with that? It's just common courtesy to wave to someone who has let you into their lane. It's a small gesture, but it can go a long way in making someone's day a little bit better. And while we're on the topic of driving, I want to share a little technique that I've been using lately. If you're on the highway and you're trying to exit, but there's a long line of cars in the exit lane, try this: get halfway into the exit lane and halfway into the bonus lane. This stops the cars behind you from speeding right past all of the (usually stopped) cars. I've seen so many people take the "bonus lane" all the way to the end at 45 mph and then swerve through two lanes of cars. It's dangerous and it's not fair to the people who have been waiting in line. So, I won't pretend that I don't get some satisfaction from thwarting the attempts of those pit-lane passing jerks. In fact, I think we should make T-shirts that say "I thwart pit-lane passing jerks." Who's with me? Well, that's all I've got for today, folks. Remember, be careful about what you share online, consider moving to Canada, and always wave to people who let you into their lane. And if you see me on the highway, give me a wave!
