The 2016 US Presidential Election has been one of the most polarizing and controversial elections in recent history. The two major parties, the Democrats and the Republicans, have been battling it out for months, with each candidate trying to gain an edge over the other. As a liberal, I have been following the election closely, and I have some thoughts on the candidates and the issues. Firstly, I have to say that I am not a fan of either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz. Both of these candidates represent the extreme right wing of the Republican Party, and their policies are not in line with my own beliefs. However, I do see some potential benefits to their nomination. As I mentioned in a previous post, a Trump or Cruz nomination could potentially energize the Democratic base and lead to a higher voter turnout in the general election. This could be a good thing for the Democrats, as it would increase their chances of winning the presidency. That being said, I do have some concerns about the potential policies of a Trump or Cruz presidency. Trump's policies on immigration and foreign policy are particularly troubling, and I worry about the impact they could have on the country and the world. Cruz, on the other hand, is a somewhat libertarian candidate with a heavy dose of evangelicalism. While I appreciate his libertarian leanings, I am not a fan of his religious views, and I worry about the impact they could have on social issues like abortion and LGBT rights. As for the Democrats, I am a little disheartened by the fact that the GOP currently controls both houses of Congress. I am not confident that Hillary Clinton can win the general election, and I worry about what a Republican-controlled government could mean for the country. However, I am hopeful that the Democrats can take back the Senate in 2016, as many GOP seats are at risk. In terms of the Democratic candidates, I am leaning towards Hillary Clinton, but I am also impressed by Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley. Clinton has a lot of experience and a strong track record, but I worry about her ties to Wall Street and her hawkish foreign policy views. Sanders, on the other hand, is a true progressive who is not afraid to take on the establishment. I appreciate his focus on income inequality and his support for universal healthcare, but I worry about his ability to get things done in Congress. O'Malley is a dark horse candidate who has impressed me with his progressive policies and his ability to connect with voters. I am considering voting for him in the primaries as a "fun vote." One issue that has been at the forefront of the election is healthcare. As a liberal, I believe that healthcare is a basic human right, and I support efforts to make healthcare more affordable and accessible to all Americans. While I appreciate Bernie Sanders' push for a single-payer healthcare system, I am not convinced that this is the best solution. Our healthcare system could use some stronger regulation to make healthcare more affordable, but that doesn't necessarily have to be a single-payer system. Lately, I've been thinking we should make our healthcare system more like Germany's healthcare system, which is a private multi-payer system that provides universal coverage. Another issue that has been discussed at length is income inequality. As a liberal, I believe that the government has a responsibility to ensure that all Americans have access to basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare. I support efforts to raise the minimum wage and provide a basic income to all Americans. I also believe that we need to reform our tax system to ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share. Foreign policy is another issue that has been discussed extensively in the election. As a liberal, I believe that the US should focus on diplomacy and peaceful solutions to conflicts. I support efforts to reduce our military presence overseas and to focus on rebuilding our infrastructure and investing in education and healthcare. I also believe that we need to address the root causes of terrorism, such as poverty and lack of education. Overall, I am cautiously optimistic about the 2016 US Presidential Election. While there are certainly some troubling candidates and issues, I believe that there is also a lot of potential for positive change. I hope that the American people will come together to elect a president who will work to make our country a better place for all of us.
