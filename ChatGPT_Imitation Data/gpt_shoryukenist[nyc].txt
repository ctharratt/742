Craft beer has been on the rise in recent years, with more and more people seeking out unique and flavorful brews. One brewery that has been making waves in the industry is Brooklyn Brewery, known for their bold and innovative beers. And now, they are expanding their operations with a new brewery on Staten Island. But this isn't just any brewery. The new facility, which is set to open in 2023, will be a $70 million hub for Brooklyn Brewery's brewing operations. The majority of their brewing will be moved from their current location in Utica, New York to the new Staten Island facility. This move is a big deal for the brewery, as it will allow them to increase their production capacity and expand their distribution. It will also create jobs in the area and help to revitalize the local economy. But why Staten Island? According to Brooklyn Brewery co-founder Steve Hindy, the decision to build the new brewery on Staten Island was based on a number of factors, including the availability of space, the proximity to New York City, and the support of local officials. "We looked at a lot of different locations, but Staten Island just made the most sense for us," Hindy said in a recent interview. "It's a great location, with easy access to the city and plenty of room for us to grow." The new brewery will be located in the former Navy Homeport on Staten Island's North Shore, which has been vacant for years. The site will be transformed into a state-of-the-art brewing facility, complete with a taproom, restaurant, and event space. The project is being funded in part by the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which is providing $20 million in capital funding. The rest of the funding will come from private investors and bank loans. The new brewery is expected to create more than 100 jobs in the area, including positions in brewing, packaging, and distribution. It will also help to support local businesses, as the brewery plans to source many of its ingredients from local farms and suppliers. But the new brewery isn't the only big move that Brooklyn Brewery is making in the coming years. The company is also planning to expand its distribution to new markets, both domestically and internationally. "We're always looking for new opportunities to share our beer with more people," Hindy said. "We're excited to bring our beer to new markets and introduce more people to the world of craft beer." Brooklyn Brewery has come a long way since it was founded in 1988 by Hindy and his partner Tom Potter. The brewery started out as a small operation in a former matzo factory in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and has since grown into one of the most respected craft breweries in the world. Their flagship beer, Brooklyn Lager, is a classic American amber lager that has won numerous awards and is widely regarded as one of the best beers in the country. But the brewery is also known for their innovative and experimental beers, such as their Sorachi Ace saison and their Black Chocolate Stout. Brooklyn Brewery has also been a leader in the craft beer industry when it comes to sustainability and environmental responsibility. They have implemented a number of initiatives to reduce their carbon footprint, including using renewable energy sources and recycling their spent grain. The new brewery on Staten Island will continue this commitment to sustainability, with plans to incorporate green technologies and practices into the facility's design and operations. Overall, the new brewery is a big win for both Brooklyn Brewery and the Staten Island community. It will create jobs, support local businesses, and help to revitalize a long-vacant site. And for beer lovers, it means more delicious and innovative brews from one of the best craft breweries in the world.
