I have to say, I'm pretty excited about the upcoming Star Wars comics published by Marvel. I can see it happening, and I think it's going to be a great way to expand the Star Wars universe even further. I mean, who doesn't want more Star Wars in their life? But let's talk about something else for a minute. Have you heard about the Spawn script being ready? Seth Todd McFarlane is definitely going with the Deadpool trend, and I have to say, I'm intrigued. I mean, Spawn is a pretty dark character, so it'll be interesting to see how McFarlane handles it. Speaking of dark characters, have you seen the Netflix show about a group of heroes with insanely swollen chests that defy physics? I mean, it's a little ridiculous, but I have to admit, I'm kind of hooked. And who knows, maybe they'll eventually bring McFarlane on as a creative consultant for the Unbelievable Pouch-Man movie. Hey, stranger things have happened. But let's get back to the topic at hand. I have to say, I'm a little confused about the whole Liefield situation. Is he doing shitty tracing now? I mean, seriously, look at the right katana handle. It looks terrible. But I'm relieved to hear that the Deadpool movie isn't going to ruin the character. I was really worried about that. And speaking of Deadpool, I have to say, I'm a little concerned about how they're going to handle the character in the movie. Do they treat him like a clown the whole time, or is there going to be some depth to his character? I mean, sure, he's funny, but there's a tragic background there that shouldn't be ignored. But let's switch gears for a minute. Have you seen Halloweentown? That movie is a classic. I always thought people thought of Disney Channel movies like they were meaningless and etc., but apparently, Halloweentown has a pretty big following. And let's not forget about Smart House. That movie was really good too. But back to the topic at hand. I have to say, I'm a little worried about the X-Men Apocalypse movie. I mean, the trailer looks amazing, but we all know how trailers can be deceiving. And let's not forget about the Fantastic Four movie. I mean, what a disaster. They were supposed to renovate the Fantastic Four, not destroy them. But let's end on a positive note. I'm really excited about the potential for more movies based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and other historical events. I mean, there's so much rich history there that could be explored. And who knows, maybe we'll even get a Spawn movie that does the character justice. Overall, I have to say, there's a lot to be excited about in the world of comics and movies. Sure, there are some missteps along the way, but that's to be expected. As long as we keep getting great content, I'm happy. And who knows, maybe one day we'll even get a Deadpool movie that truly captures the essence of the character.
