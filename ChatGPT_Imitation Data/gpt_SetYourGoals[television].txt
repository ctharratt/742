I have to agree with Charlie on this one. Sportscenter has become a bit of a disappointment lately. It seems like they just keep playing the same highlights over and over again, with some random tweets and post-death retrospectives thrown in for good measure. It's not that I don't appreciate the sentiment behind those retrospectives, but it just feels like they're trying too hard to tug at our heartstrings. But let's move on to something a bit more interesting - the new X-Men show for FX. I was really excited when I first heard about it, but then I saw the trailer and I have to admit, I was a bit underwhelmed. It just seemed like a generic action-comedy with a stoner twist. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for fun little action comedies, but I was hoping for something a bit more substantial from the X-Men franchise. That being said, I do think the writing was better than the directing, so maybe it will still be worth checking out. And who knows, maybe it will surprise us all and turn out to be amazing. Speaking of amazing, Melissa McCarthy is killing it in Hollywood right now. She's commanding huge fees for her films and it's easy to see why - she's incredibly talented and hilarious. But I do have to wonder if her time on Mike and Molly is hurting her brand a bit. I mean, it's a great show and all, but it's not exactly the kind of project that's going to propel her to the next level of stardom. But hey, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe she's perfectly happy doing the show and it's not hurting her career at all. Only time will tell. Moving on to something a bit more personal, I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of Max Landis. I've heard some stories about him being a bit of a jerk in person, and while I haven't had any personal interactions with him myself, I can definitely see how he could come across as insufferable. That being said, I do think he's a talented writer and I've enjoyed some of his movies. American Ultra was a lot of fun, and I'm definitely looking forward to checking out his new project, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. And speaking of TV shows, I have to say that I'm absolutely loving Hannibal right now. It's such a beautifully shot and well-written show, and the performances are all top-notch. I can't believe it didn't get more recognition at the awards shows. But then again, the awards shows can be a bit of a crapshoot. It seems like they always lean towards the more international shows, which is why I think Leftovers got snubbed. It's such a great show, but it's very American in tone and setting, so maybe that's why it didn't get the recognition it deserved. And don't even get me started on the political landscape right now. It's a complete mess. I mean, I know we're supposed to be a comedy site and all, but it's hard to find anything funny about the current state of affairs. The GOP front runners are a complete joke. I mean, seriously, a compulsive lying neurosurgeon who doesn't believe in science? A crazy tweeting billionaire? It's like we're living in some kind of bizarre alternate reality. And yet, somehow, these guys are still in the running for the highest office in the land. It's enough to make you want to scream. But I guess that's why we need comedy now more than ever. We need people who can take these ridiculous situations and turn them into something we can all laugh at. Because if we can't laugh, what else is there? So let's keep laughing, even in the face of all this insanity. Let's keep watching our favorite shows and movies, and let's keep making fun of the people who deserve it. Because at the end of the day, that's all we can really do.
