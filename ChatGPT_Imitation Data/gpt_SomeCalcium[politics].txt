As someone who works in higher education, it absolutely breaks my heart to see smart and deserving students turned away from good schools simply because it is not cost-effective for them. On the flip side, it is just as bad to see students accumulate an irresponsible amount of debt in order to attend the school of their dreams. It's a broken system, one of many, and it will only get worse under a leader who is as pragmatic as Clinton. However, I must say that I am impressed with how well Clinton has been doing in the debates I have seen her in. She has a strong presence and is able to articulate her points well. But it's easy to see through her debate approach. Clinton has wrapped herself in the Obama mantle, and tonight her approach was "Bernie's issues are my issues, and Obama is the best president we have ever had." Bernie threw some serious punches, and Clinton was really reeling towards the end. That being said, he had a terrible start. He just stumped and ignored the questions. The debate really changed when they started talking about economic issues and immigration. This was an older audience, and just by listening to the issues they cared and didn't care about, it was clear that Social Security got tons of applause and a lot of attention. They were pretty much asleep on foreign policy and immigration. Clinton had a lot more applause because she played towards the audience. She brought up problems in Wisconsin (mentioning Scott Walker a lot) throughout the entire debate. Bernie didn't bother. I don't know if they're stacked in favor of one or the other, but Clinton definitely played towards the audience. The audience perked up with Social Security, but they are asleep right now. It's interesting to see how the political process has evolved over the years. Voters seem to have developed an attitude that they are entitled to any private information about a candidate they want, as long as they think there might be something incriminating contained within. While I agree that we do not need to know every private aspect about a candidate's life, this isn't a conversation between Hillary and Bill. This was a speech delivered to an audience. The line of reason is as follows: Clinton tells the voting public that she is anti-Wall Street and anti-big bank. Clinton was paid extremely large sums of money by corporations on Wall Street to speak privately for them. Voters would like to know if the narrative she is spinning for the voting public is true, or if she is saying one thing to the public and something entirely different to these people. It just seems hypocritical to say one thing to one audience and (potentially) an entirely different thing to another audience. Who does she value more? Barring trolling, of course. To be fair, if Clinton is up against Donald Trump in the general election, I think America is much more willing to look past a lot of this stuff. Trump's history isn't exactly stellar in terms of being a traditional conservative candidate. Although many Sanders supporters are saying that they will not vote for Clinton because she is slimy or whatever, I (and many others) feel that she still represents some of our ideals. I would vote for her in a general election for that reason if she were to win legitimately. However, if Bernie were to win the populist vote only to have Clinton turn around and win the nomination due to superdelegates, that is essentially a giant "fuck you" to the voters. It will essentially confirm what Sanders is saying, that the political process is rigged. If that were the case, I would be staying home in November. I fear that I am not alone. This is why superdelegates can't matter. I must say that I am impressed with how well Sanders has been doing in the primaries. It's crazy to see how well he is doing, especially considering how skewed some of the early primaries are towards a specific demographic (evangelicals, old people, white people, etc.). I really wish we could see states like Ohio in the early primaries so they would be less skewed towards a specific demographic.
