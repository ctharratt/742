Holy shit, I can't believe this is still an issue. It's been years since the game was released and yet here we are, still dealing with the same problems. I mean, come on, how hard is it to rotate the maps properly? I paid for this game, I paid to support the developers and their content, but what am I getting in return? One map out of the entire rotation. And don't even get me started on the pass. Sure, you don't need the pass to play the maps, but the pass requires you to play on the maps. And guess what? I can't play on them. So what's the point of even having the pass? It's like paying for a gym membership but only being allowed to use one machine. It's ridiculous. And yet, there are still people out there who are perfectly content with the free content they're getting. Eight years after release and they're still satisfied with the same old maps. It's like they have no standards or expectations whatsoever. Did they even read what I said? I paid for this game, I paid to support the developers and their content. I didn't pay for a half-assed product. It's like funding a project on Kickstarter. You give money to something you believe in, in order to support the developer and get whatever perks they provide. In this case, not only am I not getting the perks, I'm not even getting the base product. And yet, people still defend the developers and their lack of effort. But it's not just about the maps and the pass. It's about the overall experience. The DM is supposed to be a god, but he's not a benevolent one. He doesn't care if your bird is named Anne Frank. If you roll a one, it will die in the most awful way imaginable. And yet, we keep coming back for more. We approach a goblin hut with a fireplace and a well, and we can hear mystical chanting from inside. What do we do? "I cast detect Gibus." And lo and behold, there is a Gibus nearby. The party gasps in shock and awe. But then the heavy starts glowing red and shuffling, the scout fails his lag check and gets stabbed in the face, and the DM gets hit in the face with a shovel and dies. It's just another day in the world of roleplaying games. And don't even get me started on the weapons. The fish, the holy mackerel, the powerjack, the danger shield. They all have their own quirks and advantages, but they also have their own flaws and drawbacks. The fish may be a fun weapon to use, but it's not exactly practical in a fight. And the powerjack may be forgiving, but it's not exactly fair. And then there are the glitches and bugs. The weird weapon switching bug, the air blasting by the powerjack, the reduced range of Sona's Q. It's like the developers don't even care about fixing these issues. They just patch over them and hope for the best. But despite all of these problems, we keep playing. We keep coming back for more. Maybe it's because we're masochists, or maybe it's because we just love the game that much. Either way, we keep playing, we keep supporting the developers, and we keep hoping for a better experience. So come on, developers. Step up your game. Rotate the maps properly, fix the glitches and bugs, and give us the experience we deserve. We paid for it, after all.
