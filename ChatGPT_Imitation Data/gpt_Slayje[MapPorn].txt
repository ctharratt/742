I was looking at a map the other day and it got me thinking about a lot of different things. First of all, I noticed that Harvard wasn't included in the game I was playing, which was a bit surprising. But then I saw that MIT was included, although it was called CIT in the game. It's interesting how certain places become more well-known than others, even if they're both prestigious universities. Then I noticed a familiar grey shape in central Europe. It was the Benelux region, which includes Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. I've always been fascinated by this area, as it's one of the most densely populated regions in the world. Both the Hague/Rotterdam and the Amsterdam metropolitan areas are larger in population than the Brussels metropolitan area. It's amazing to think about how so many people can live in such a small area. As a Dutchman, I've spoken to South Africans a few times and I can say that Afrikaans sounds like a simplified version of Dutch. Some letters have disappeared and some words have been replaced by other words with a very literal meaning. But when I pay a bit of attention, I can understand it. It sounds rather funny, as if someone who isn't very proficient at speaking Dutch is still trying. So yeah, it's very much a new language. Not strange seeing as how it evolved 'half a world away' for so long, but still mostly understandable! I also came across a map that showed the potential effects of climate change. It showed the south of England and the Netherlands effectively turning into a desert. Also, the interior of Australia will transform to 'no longer farmable'. It really isn't already. No topsoil, rocky, evaporation rates tens of times higher than precipitation rates. Kind of a weird theory or map anyway. Then again, I'm no climatologist. I've traveled quite a bit in Europe and I can say that staying in Luxembourg City or in Frankfurt (about 2 hours apart with German Autobahn speed of about 150 KMH) does feel very different. It's interesting how even a short distance can make such a big difference in terms of culture and atmosphere. I also started thinking about the political landscape of Europe. The Benelux countries are relatively small, but if they were to unify, they would have a combined population of about 28.6 million inhabitants and a combined GDP larger than that of Spain (but smaller than Italy). We might have had some semblance of a voice in Europe. Also, I like Benelux people. AFAIK, most Belgians aren't too keen on getting back together though, and Luxembourgers probably even less so. I guess there is nothing left to do but bow to our overlord, Frau Merkel. Another interesting thing I noticed on the map was the size of certain countries. For example, Qatar might still be lower on average elevation as it's very flat with a highest elevation of just over 100 meters, but I can't find a proper source right now and I'm supposed to be working. It's amazing how much we can learn from maps, even if they're not always accurate. I also found it interesting that every municipality in the Netherlands has had a map like this published. On the Wikipedia page of every municipality, you can find one like these. For example, my hometown, Nijmegen! What surprises me most about all the figures here is that the Netherlands was so sparsely populated. Belgium had more inhabitants at the time! In fact, the Netherlands has about the same growth rate (3 x as many inhabitants now) as India and China have had, while the rest of Europe has a lot lower growth rates. Does anyone know how this came to be? Also, I've been looking on the map, but I can't find a date. Any idea when this was created? It's interesting to think about how different parts of the world have evolved over time. Nijmegen, where I live, is supposed to be the oldest city in the Netherlands, first settled by the Romans (then known as Noviomagus, still the source of the current name Nijmegen). It's actually built on one of the few hilly parts of the Netherlands outside of the absolute south, and we still hold an annual 'Zevenheuvelenloop', or seven-hill-run. Which takes you over, you guessed it, seven hills. In other words, you're wrong. Many of the other examples are probably also quite right. I also found it interesting that some countries have multiple names depending on the language. For example, the Netherlands is also known as Holland, and Germany is also known as Deutschland. It's amazing how language can shape our perceptions of the world. Overall, I think maps are a great way to learn about the world around us. They can show us how different parts of the world are connected, and how they have evolved over time. They can also help us understand the political and cultural landscape of different regions. I'm definitely going to be spending more time looking at maps in the future!
