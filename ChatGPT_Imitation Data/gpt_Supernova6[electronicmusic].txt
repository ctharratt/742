Hey there fellow electronic music enthusiasts! Welcome to /r/electronicmusic, where the beats never stop and the bass is always thumping. As an aspiring electronic music producer myself, I'm always on the lookout for advice and tips from those who have made it in the industry. So, if you have any words of wisdom to share, please do! But before we get into that, let's talk about something equally important: bacon. I mean, who doesn't love bacon? It's crispy, salty, and oh so delicious. In fact, I think bacon should be a mandatory ingredient in all electronic music production studios. It just makes everything better. Now, onto the music. As for my favorite electronic music songs, there are just too many to list. But here are a few that always get me moving: - Daft Punk - One More Time - The Chemical Brothers - Block Rockin' Beats - Justice - D.A.N.C.E. - Deadmau5 - Strobe - Aphex Twin - Windowlicker - Boards of Canada - Roygbiv - Burial - Archangel - Flying Lotus - Do the Astral Plane - Four Tet - Love Cry - Jon Hopkins - Open Eye Signal As you can see, my taste in electronic music is pretty diverse. I love everything from classic house and techno to experimental and ambient. But if I had to pick a favorite genre, it would probably be techno. There's just something about those driving beats and hypnotic rhythms that always gets me in the zone. Now, let's talk about some tips for aspiring electronic music producers. First and foremost, practice, practice, practice. The more time you spend honing your craft, the better you'll get. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things. Some of the best electronic music comes from pushing boundaries and breaking rules. Another important tip is to listen to as much music as possible. Not just electronic music, but all genres. You never know where inspiration might come from. And don't be afraid to steal ideas from other artists. As Picasso once said, "Good artists copy, great artists steal." Collaboration is also key. Working with other producers and musicians can help you learn new techniques and approaches to music production. Plus, it's always more fun to make music with friends. And finally, don't forget to have fun. Making music should be a joyous and fulfilling experience. If you're not having fun, then what's the point? As for my favorite part of making music, it's definitely the creative process. There's nothing quite like starting with a blank canvas and slowly building something from scratch. It's a magical feeling when everything starts to come together and you can hear the finished product in your head. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go listen to some more electronic music. But before I go, I'll leave you with a few more of my favorite tracks: - Aphex Twin - Come to Daddy - Boards of Canada - Dayvan Cowboy - Burial - Untrue - Daft Punk - Around the World - Flying Lotus - Never Catch Me - Four Tet - She Just Likes to Fight - Jon Hopkins - Collider - Justice - Genesis - The Chemical Brothers - Hey Boy Hey Girl - Deadmau5 - Ghosts 'n' Stuff Thanks for hosting this AMA, and keep the beats coming!
