It's always interesting to see how different people approach their reading habits. Some people stick to one genre, while others jump around from fantasy to crime noir to horror. Personally, I like to mix it up and keep things fresh. Right now, I'm in the middle of a crime noir novel and a horror anthology, but I'm already thinking about what fantasy book I want to dive into next. I'm torn between two options: Midnight Tides, the fifth book in the Malazan series, or Shadows of Self, a Mistborn novel. Both have been recommended to me by friends and fellow readers, and I'm excited to see what all the fuss is about. But first, I need to finish my current reads. One thing I've noticed is that a lot of my favorite authors have been recommended to me through Reddit. It's a great platform for finding new books and discussing them with like-minded individuals. I've discovered some amazing series and standalone novels thanks to the recommendations of others. Speaking of series, I'm currently 29% through House of Chains, the fourth book in the Malazan series. It's been a wild ride so far, and I can't believe how much has happened in just a third of the way through the book. The Chain of Dogs storyline was nothing short of epic, and I'm excited to see where the rest of the series takes me. But as much as I love the Malazan series, I have to admit that it can be a bit daunting at times. The world-building is incredibly complex, and there are so many characters and plotlines to keep track of. Sometimes, I need a break from all the epicness and just want to read something a bit more straightforward. That's where crime noir and horror come in. They're both genres that I enjoy, but for different reasons. Crime noir is all about the gritty, hard-boiled detective stories that take place in seedy underworlds. It's a genre that's been around for decades, but it still manages to feel fresh and exciting. Horror, on the other hand, is all about the scares. I love the feeling of being on edge while reading a good horror story, and the adrenaline rush that comes with it. It's a genre that can be hit or miss, but when it's done right, it's incredibly satisfying. One horror setting that I particularly enjoyed was Threnody. It had a creepy, horror atmosphere that really drew me in. I'd love to return to that world someday and see what other horrors await. Of course, not all books have to be scary or epic. Sometimes, it's nice to read something that's just plain fun. That's why I still enjoy watching shows like MTV's Teen Wolf, even though it's been years since I've watched anything on that channel. It's a guilty pleasure, but sometimes those are the best kind of pleasures. One thing that can be frustrating as a reader is waiting for a new book in a series to come out. It can be especially frustrating when it's been years since the last book was released. But as much as I want to read the next book in a series, I've learned to be patient. There are plenty of other books out there to enjoy in the meantime. Overall, I think it's important to keep an open mind when it comes to reading. There are so many amazing books out there, and it's impossible to read them all. But by trying out different genres and authors, you never know what hidden gems you might discover.
