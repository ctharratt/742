I don't know about you, but I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed lately. It seems like there's always something to do, something to worry about, something to plan for. And while I know that's just part of being a teenager, sometimes it feels like it's all too much. That's why I've been trying to find ways to relax and unwind, even if it's just for a little while. And one thing that's been helping me is music. I've always loved listening to music, but lately I've been really getting into some new artists and genres that I hadn't explored before. For example, I recently discovered Porter Robinson. I don't know how I hadn't heard of him before, but his music is amazing. I was planning on playing one of his songs at a party I was hosting, but then I realized I already had three other Porter songs lined up, so I didn't want to overdo it. Still, I'm definitely going to keep listening to him. Another artist I've been enjoying is Twenty One Pilots. I'm not sure how their music would go over at a party, but I really like their sound. I've only heard a few of their songs so far, but I'm definitely going to check out more. Of course, not all music is meant for parties. Sometimes I just want to listen to something soft and mellow, like Bon Iver or The xx. And then there are times when I want to listen to something that really gets me pumped up, like Kendrick Lamar or Run the Jewels. But music isn't the only thing that's been helping me relax. I've also been trying to watch more movies. I'm a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so I've been trying to watch all the movies in order. It's been a fun project, and it's something I can do on my own or with friends. Speaking of friends, I've been trying to spend more time with them lately. It's easy to get caught up in school and extracurriculars and forget to make time for the people who matter most. But I've been making a conscious effort to hang out with my friends more, whether it's going to a movie or just grabbing lunch. Of course, not all friendships are easy. I've been dealing with a bit of a crush lately, and it's been tough. I thought she might be interested in me too, but then she started showing more interest in one of my friends. It's hard to see her with someone else, but at the same time, I just want her to be happy. So I've been trying to be supportive of both of them, even if it hurts a little. But even with all the ups and downs, I'm still grateful for my friends. They're the ones who make me laugh when I'm feeling down, who listen when I need to vent, who remind me that I'm not alone. And that's really what it's all about, isn't it? Finding ways to cope with the stress and uncertainty of being a teenager, and surrounding yourself with people who care about you. It's not always easy, but it's worth it.
