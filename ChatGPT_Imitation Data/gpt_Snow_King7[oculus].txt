Hey there, fellow VR enthusiasts! Charlie here, and I wanted to share my thoughts on the ongoing debate between the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive. As someone who has had the opportunity to try both headsets, I have to say that I am torn between the two. Let's start with the design. While the Oculus Rift has a sleek and minimalist look, I have to agree with some of the other commenters that the touch design is more of a negative than a positive. Personally, I prefer the design of the Vive wands, which feel more natural in my hands. However, when it comes to the actual headset, I have to say that the Oculus Rift is the winner for me. The fit is more comfortable and the overall experience is better. Now, let's talk about the motion controllers. While the Vive's motion controllers are definitely a selling point, I don't think they are necessarily a dealbreaker for the Oculus Rift. Sure, the touch controllers may not be as advanced, but they still get the job done and provide a great VR experience. One thing that I do think sets the Vive apart is the Tron mode. It's a small feature, but it's definitely a cool one. Plus, the Vive's wider field of view is also a plus in my book. Moving on to software, I have to say that I am a huge fan of Anarchy Arcade. It's my own digital mancave built specifically to my liking, and I can't wait to walk around inside it in VR. As for games, I'm a YuGiOh fan all the way, and I'm hoping to see some VR adaptations of the game in the future. Speaking of adaptations, I'm also excited to see how VR will be incorporated into the upcoming Armada movie. The book directly mentions the Oculus Rift, so it's definitely a possibility. Now, let's address some of the common questions and concerns that have been brought up in the comments. First off, yes, you can play Steam games fine without an internet connection. And no, you don't need the Steam overlay for the Vive controller to work. It's a pain to manually edit the controller's default desktop control settings, but it works sans Steam. As for the high price of VR headsets, I think it's important to remember that it costs a lot to design, manufacture, develop, and market these devices. It's not just a matter of slapping some screens and lenses together and calling it a day. And while there are currently exclusives for the Oculus Rift, I don't think they will stay exclusive for long. Modding communities will likely have programs up to make each headset emulate the other in a few months tops. Finally, I want to address the issue of free speech and online companies like Facebook. While it's true that these companies have the right to take away your free speech within their products, it's important to remember that the government can't impede your right to exercise your free speech. It's a subtle but important distinction. In conclusion, I'm still undecided as to whether I want to keep the Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive as my final HMD. I have enough funds to preorder both, but I still feel it's a little wasteful to have two very expensive devices that do the same thing. So, I'll be selling whichever one I enjoy less on eBay. Does that make me a scalper? I don't think so, but I'm open to hearing other opinions. Thanks for reading, and happy VR-ing!
