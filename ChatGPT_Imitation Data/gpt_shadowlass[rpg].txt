Ah, secrets. The currency of the realm in any good RPG. There's nothing quite like the thrill of knowing something that the other players don't, or having a hidden agenda that you're working towards. It adds a layer of intrigue and excitement to the game that can't be matched by anything else. But secrets aren't the only thing that can make a game great. I'm a big fan of NPCs who deal in favors. It's a great way to bring the party together and give them a common goal. I once had a campaign where all the players had to come up with a reason why they owed a certain NPC a favor. It was a great way to get them invested in the story and give them a reason to work together. The NPC in question was incredibly resourceful. He knew everyone and had a favor owed to him by just about everyone in town. It made him a valuable ally, but also a dangerous enemy. The players knew that if they ever crossed him, he could make their lives very difficult. Of course, the downside to having an NPC like this is that you know he's going to come calling for those favors eventually. And when he does, the players are going to have to pay up. It could be something as simple as running an errand for him, or it could be something much more dangerous. But that's part of the fun, right? When it comes to ending a session, I'm a big fan of cliffhangers. There's nothing quite like leaving the players on the edge of their seats, wondering what's going to happen next. Of course, you don't want to do it too often, or it can start to feel like a cheap trick. But every once in a while, it's a great way to keep the players engaged and excited for the next session. As for switching systems, I'm all for it. There are so many great RPGs out there, it's a shame to limit yourself to just one. I like to switch things up every once in a while, just to keep things fresh. And if the players are getting bored with the current system, it's a good sign that it's time to try something new. One thing I've found helpful when looking for new players or groups is to check out local gaming shops. They often have bulletin boards where you can post ads looking for players or groups. It's a great way to connect with other gamers in your area. When it comes to running a campaign, I like to involve the players as much as possible. I'll often ask them for backstory or ideas that I can incorporate into the game. It's a great way to make the players feel invested in the story and give them a sense of ownership over their characters. I also like to give the players opportunities to create things in the setting. Whether it's a town they come from, an organization they belong to, or a few contacts and close friends, it's important to give them something that feels like it belongs to them. It makes the world feel more real and gives the players a reason to care about what happens in it. Of course, it's also important to let the players run loose and do their own thing. Some of the best moments in a game come from just letting the players talk and interact with each other. It's a great way to build relationships between characters and create memorable moments that will stick with the players long after the game is over. In the end, the key to a great RPG is to keep things fresh and exciting. Whether it's through secrets, favors, or just letting the players run wild, it's important to keep the players engaged and invested in the story. And if you can do that, you'll have a game that everyone will remember for years to come.
