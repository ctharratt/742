As a long-time Magic: The Gathering player, I have seen many different strategies and play styles come and go. But one thing that has remained constant is the importance of having a solid card base to build from. That's why I'm a big advocate of fat packs, especially for new players. For those who may not know, a fat pack is a bundle of Magic cards that includes a good storage box, a pair of deck boxes, a life counter, all the lands you'll need, and most importantly, a card base. From there, you can easily experiment with a few different play styles and move on to more serious deck building by getting specific cards. As a beginner, it's important not to worry about competitive play right away. Have some fun putting together your own play style, get comfortable with it, then go out and compete! But be warned, there are some cards out there that can make even the most experienced players shake their heads in frustration. Take Cavern of Souls, for example. This land card makes an already overpowered Standard tribe even better by making them uncounterable and even easier to cast. It's no wonder it's on the ban/restricted list. But even with cards like this out there, it's important to remember that Magic is a game of strategy and skill, not just luck. One of my favorite cards to play with is Deranged Outcast. It may not be the most powerful card out there, but it's always fun to see the look on your opponent's face when you start sacrificing your own creatures to pump up your werewolf army. And speaking of werewolves, Guardian of the Gateless is another great card to have in your arsenal. But it's not just about individual cards. The art and animation in Magic is also a big part of what makes the game so enjoyable. I remember playing the Bant deck just to see the animation for Giltspire Avenger, which was by far the best. And let's not forget about the flavor text on some of these cards. Everyone knows that a real Black Lotus has a very distinctive taste. Do the lick test. Of course, it's not all fun and games. There are some cards out there that can be downright frustrating to play against. Thassa's Emissary is one of those cards that can turn the tide of a game in an instant. But that's just part of the challenge of playing Magic. You have to be prepared for anything. And speaking of challenges, I once tried to see how many zombies I could get just sitting there with an Endless Ranks of the Dead. I forget where the tokens maxed out, but the combat step took forever. But it's not just about quantity, it's also about quality. Divinity of Pride is one of those cards that can really buff up a B/W devotion deck. But it's not just about individual cards or decks. It's also about the community. I've met some of my closest friends through playing Magic, and I've seen firsthand how the game can bring people together. Whether it's playing in a local tournament or just hanging out with friends, Magic is a great way to connect with others who share your passion for the game. So if you're a new player just starting out, don't be intimidated by all the different cards and strategies out there. Take your time, experiment with different play styles, and most importantly, have fun. And who knows, maybe one day you'll be the one shaking your opponent's head in frustration with a well-timed Deranged Outcast or Guardian of the Gateless.
