I recently made the switch from a MacBook Pro to an Asus N550JK, and I have to say, I'm pretty happy with my decision. My MacBook Pro had a common issue that Apple refuses to acknowledge, and I was tired of dealing with it. Plus, the Asus N550JK is much more affordable and runs games really well, which is a big plus for me. I know I've already explained my view on this topic in this thread, but I'll say it again just in case: I don't think it's worth having long discussions about the best way to communicate a message. We all have different views on this, and that's okay. I don't expect everyone to agree with me, and I don't want anyone to feel like they have to concede to my point of view. That being said, I do think it's important to be mindful of how our messages are being perceived by others. The message may be clear to us, but it may not be clear to everyone else. And if our message is being perceived in a negative way, then it's not constructive. For example, I recently saw a shirt that said "Take your deluded male power fantasies somewhere else." While I understand the message behind the shirt, I don't think it's the best way to approach the issue of gender equality. It makes it seem like gender equality is a war of the sexes, when in reality, it's not. We should be addressing these issues with empathy and understanding, not by creating two opposing sides. I also don't think it's fair to make broad statements about any group of people, whether it's white people, men, or any other group. It's not productive to accuse an entire group of people of something, even if some members of that group are guilty of it. We should be focusing on the individuals who are perpetuating these issues, not the entire group. That being said, I do think it's important to acknowledge that there are issues with sexism, racism, and other forms of discrimination in our society. We need to work together to address these issues and create a more equal and just world for everyone. On a lighter note, I recently discovered a simulation game called Long Live the Queen, and I highly recommend it. It's a game where you have to manage your time and actions to prepare for life-threatening events that will happen to you. It's challenging, but also really fun. In terms of game development, I've dabbled in it a bit myself. I started with gamemaker when I was 14, and I've since tried my hand at Objective-C development and using frameworks like Cocos2D and Ren'py. I've found that there are a lot of new cross-platform engines and frameworks that make game development much easier than it used to be. I think interactive fiction and visual novels are an area that still hasn't been fully explored in the gaming industry. Most stories in games are fairly linear, but there's so much potential for interactivity and player choice. I was really fascinated by an experiment called Fa√ßade, which allowed players to interact with the story in a much more meaningful way than most games do. Coding can be difficult to digest at first, but I think the end result is worth it. Before I started studying computer science at university, I was worried that I would end up doing something boring that wouldn't allow me to express myself creatively. But watching Indie Game: The Movie and participating in game jams like Ludum Dare convinced me to keep pursuing my dream of making games. If you're interested in game development, I highly recommend participating in a game jam. It's a great way to learn and grow as a developer, and even if you don't finish your game in time, you'll still learn a lot from the experience. Just remember to take it easy and not get too stressed out. Even a failed project can be a huge learning experience.
