Hey there! I couldn't agree more with Charlie's love for Star vs. the Forces of Evil, Gravity Falls, and Over the Garden Wall. Those shows are all fantastic and definitely deserve all the love they can get. But let's talk about Steven Universe, shall we? First off, I feel Charlie's pain about waiting for new episodes. It's tough being a fan of a show that has such long hiatuses between seasons. But when the new episodes finally do come out, it's always worth the wait. And speaking of new episodes, I can't wait to see what happens in the upcoming Stevenbomb. The last one was so intense and emotional, and I have a feeling this one will be just as good. I also love the idea of doing reaction videos to the new episodes. It's always fun to see other fans' reactions to the show, especially when something big happens. And speaking of big things happening, can we talk about how amazing it was when Steven fused with Connie for the first time? That was such a powerful moment, and the song that played during it was so beautiful. I also agree with Charlie's desire to ask the Gems (and Greg) a bunch of questions and not let them evade them. There are so many things I want to know about the show's lore and characters, and I'm sure other fans feel the same way. Hopefully, we'll get some answers in the upcoming episodes. And can we talk about how amazing the show's music is? The songs are all so catchy and well-written, and they add so much to the show's emotional moments. I especially love "Stronger Than You" and "It's Over, Isn't It?" Those songs give me chills every time I hear them. I also love how the show handles its characters' flaws and toxic traits. It's so refreshing to see a show that doesn't shy away from showing its characters' imperfections and how they affect those around them. Pearl is a great example of this, and I love how the show has explored her character over the course of the series. And let's not forget about the show's amazing world-building. The show has created such a rich and detailed world, full of interesting locations and creatures. I would love to see more of the Galaxy Warp and other planets in the show's universe. Overall, Steven Universe is an amazing show that deserves all the love and attention it gets. It's a show that's full of heart, humor, and emotion, and it's one of the best things on TV right now. I can't wait to see what happens next in the show's story, and I'm sure other fans feel the same way.
