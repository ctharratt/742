Windows updates can be a real pain, especially if you have an older hard drive that isn't performing as well as it used to. It's not uncommon for updates to get stuck for an hour or more, and the thought of starting over can be daunting. That's why it's important to be patient and wait as long as possible before attempting to restart the update process. If you're updating your system, it's best to do all the updates at once. However, be careful not to select any optional updates, install anything, or enable Microsoft Updates if your updates are that out of date. Just let everything complete with just important updates until you've spent around six hours updating and rebooted around 15 times. Once everything is up to date, then you can consider other optional updates. Otherwise, you may get stuck in Windows' famous update loop of death, which can be frustrating and time-consuming. It's not uncommon for Windows updates to fail, and when they do, you may see a message that says "rolling back updates." This can take up to 20 hours, so it's best to avoid this situation if possible. To prevent this from happening, it's important to keep your system up to date and to be patient when updating. If you're experiencing slow performance or your hard drive usage is high, it's important to identify the culprit. Open Task Manager and look for the resource monitor button. This will show you which app is using up your hard drive usage. It's likely that scans, updates, or the collection of spy data is causing the issue. If nothing sticks out as eating up your HDD usage, then it's time for a full disk fitness scan. If you're having trouble with your BIOS, it's important to understand that many BIOS fields control overclocking of the CPU, power voltage controls, and other important settings. Some motherboards default to the GPU if it detects anything in the PCIe slot, but not all do. During testing, it's common to have a monitor connected to both, but you can still set it to on-board. Testing and/or replacing the CMOS battery is often the first step in resolving BIOS issues. If you're experiencing no video but can navigate into Windows by memory, you may need to select an on-board versus PCI-E graphics option in the BIOS. The BIOS may be defaulting to the wrong one, which will make video not work until Windows decides to activate the correct video output. You can confirm this by connecting the on-board video to a monitor. When it comes to updating drivers, it's important to remember that Windows Update will update everything for you, especially if you check the optional updates. Your motherboard drivers never really need to be updated unless you have a problem with new hardware working. Your GPU drivers should be updated manually, always directly from the manufacturer's website, maybe about once every six months, or when you purchase a new graphics intense game to make sure it works at the best of its ability. For the most part, if everything works, driver updates are not needed. Some important security updates come out for things like Ethernet/wifi cards, but Windows Update should push those. Newer graphics drivers can come with improved gaming performance, and brand new games can require the latest graphics drivers to work properly. Never use other automatic driver programs other than Windows Update. If you're experiencing issues with your computer, it's important to diagnose the problem properly. Some things can take hours, like scans, especially if you have a regular non-solid-state hard drive. These will be easy to see by opening Task Manager, going to the Performance tab, clicking the Resource Monitor button, going to the Disk Activity section, and clicking on the Read column to sort, showing what program is doing the most disk reading. Then click the Write column to sort by what program is doing the most disk writing. Google the program name to expedite finding out what it is and if this seems correct. Ignore things like Prefetch and search indexer. It still could be something malicious, so check for a program hogging CPU in Task Manager. Some things can see you are using your computer, moving mouse / typing, and pause until it thinks you are away. Malwarebytes/Antivirus are just a very dumb last line of defense, they don't catch everything, just common stuff. Probably just annoyingly updating or doing things in the background that you didn't ask for. If you're experiencing issues with your Ethernet connection, it's important to understand that cheaper doesn't convert to Ethernet, it just puts it over a similar data cable. There will be many to convert serial to RJ45 cables, but not to the IP protocol (such as TCP/IP). When they do this, it is just a data cable, not Ethernet. So like "this adapter" you linked, you do want a TCP/IP Ethernet to RS232 converter. Note the protocols included, not just the connector, as opposed to a DB9 to RJ45 converter. You also have to be careful as many products that look like what you want are just USB Ethernet adapters. They have software and drivers that make the USB device that connects to Ethernet a regular Ethernet adapter without exposing a serial data stream as a COM port. In conclusion, Windows updates can be frustrating, but it's important to be patient and wait for them to complete. If you're experiencing issues with your computer, it's important to diagnose the problem properly and take the necessary steps to resolve it. Remember to always update your drivers manually and to be careful when selecting optional updates. With a little patience and know-how, you can keep your computer running smoothly and avoid common issues.
