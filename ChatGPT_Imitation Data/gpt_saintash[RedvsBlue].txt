So, I finally got my hands on the Red vs Blue: The Ultimate Fan Guide, and I have to say, I have some mixed feelings about it. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of great content in there, but I feel like a lot of it is stuff that fans of the show would already know. Let's start with the good stuff. I absolutely loved the behind-the-scenes section at the end of the book. It was really interesting to read about how the show is made, and I especially enjoyed the interviews with the voice actors. It was cool to get some insight into what it's like to work on the show, and to hear some funny stories from the recording booth. I also really enjoyed the sections on the robot laws, O'Malley's evil plans, and Donut's diary. Those were all really fun to read, and they added some great depth to the show's lore. I also loved the section on Wash's recruitment, and the meeting between Leonard and Allison. Those were both really well-written and added some great backstory to the show. However, there were some things about the book that I didn't love. For one thing, I thought the layout was a bit strange. The book is longer than it is tall, which makes it look a bit odd on a bookshelf. I also didn't understand why there were 30 pages dedicated to location information. While it's cool to know where all the different locations in the show are, I don't think it needed to take up that much space in the book. Another thing that bothered me was the timeline. It just doesn't make sense to me that all the freelancer backstory stuff in seasons 9 and 10 took place over years, while Blood Gulch only took place over a year and a half. And the fact that season 10 took a whole year just seems crazy to me. I know it's a nit-picky thing, but it really bothered me. I also didn't love the fact that there were only a few pages dedicated to some of the characters. For example, there was no profile for Junior, which I was really disappointed about. I know not everyone loves Junior as much as I do, but I still think he deserved a profile. And while there were profiles for most of the characters, there were a few missing, which seemed odd to me. Finally, I thought the book was a bit expensive for what it was. While there was some great new content in there, a lot of it was stuff that fans of the show would already know. And while I understand that the book is meant to be a fan guide, I still think it could have been a bit more comprehensive. All that being said, I still think the Red vs Blue: The Ultimate Fan Guide is worth checking out if you're a fan of the show. There's a lot of great content in there, and it's really well-written. And while there are some things about the book that I didn't love, I still think it's a great addition to any RvB fan's collection. One thing I would have liked to see more of in the book is in-depth pre-war stuff about the reds and blues. I know there's a lot of information out there about the show's lore, but I think it would have been cool to have more of that in the book. Even silly things would have worked, it didn't have to be anything that messed with headcanons. I also would have liked to see more information about the wars, both Alien/Chorus. It's still not clear to me if this is in the Halo universe or not, and I think it would have been cool to have some reports from past leaders from both sides before Kimball and Doyle. Another thing I would have liked to see more of is information about what Charon Industries has their hands in. We know they're up to no good, but I think it would have been cool to have more information about what they're actually doing. Finally, I would have loved if every voice actor wrote something about the character they play. It would have been cool to hear what it's been like for them for the last 13 years, and to hear some funny stories and things they didn't see coming. I think that would have added a really personal touch to the book. Overall, I think the Red vs Blue: The Ultimate Fan Guide is a good addition to any RvB fan's collection. While there are some things about the book that I didn't love, there's still a lot of great content in there. And if you're a fan of the show, I think it's definitely worth checking out.
