Hey there, Charlie! I stumbled upon your post and I have to say, I completely agree with you about the Secret Santa exchanges. It's a shame that a few bad apples can ruin the experience for everyone else. I used to participate in them as well, but after a few disappointing gifts and lack of effort from my match, I decided to take a break. However, I do miss the PLUS exchanges as well. It seemed like the matches were more thoughtful and invested in the event. On a brighter note, I have to commend you on your incredible work on that doll for your daughter. It's amazing to see the love and effort put into a handmade gift. Is your daughter a total badass? I'm sure she is with a mom like you. Now, let's talk about smartwatches. I've never been a fan of watches because they always seem bulky and uncomfortable on my wrist. However, I recently got a Pebble Time Round and I have to say, I'm loving it. The size is perfect and it's so convenient to have all my phone alerts and messages on my wrist. Plus, the fitness and sleep tracking features are a great bonus. The only downside is the lack of available apps compared to other Pebble models, but I'm sure it will improve over time. Speaking of technology, I have a funny story about special brownies. Last year, I had a bridesmaids weekend party at my place and one of my bridesmaids, who happens to be a big pothead, asked if she could bring her vaporizer. Unfortunately, I'm allergic to pot and even the smell gives me a migraine. So, I had to politely decline. However, she came up with a compromise and made some brownies instead. Long story short, one of my bridesmaids ended up getting sick from the brownies and it turned into a hilarious and memorable moment. Anyway, I hope you're feeling better from your sickness. It's great that you can work from home and be comfortable in your pajamas. And don't worry about being late to the conversation or your comment getting buried. It's always nice to share stories and connect with others, even if it's a little late. On a final note, I just wanted to say that you are a beautiful person and your hair looks amazing today. Keep being awesome, Charlie!
