The recent Republican National Committee (RNC) debate was a complete disaster. The moderators were biased, the questions were leading, and the audience reactions were hilariously overacted. It was clear that the RNC was trying to stack the deck against certain candidates, particularly Donald Trump. However, this heavy-handed approach is only going to strengthen Trump's support among the base, as it treats them like idiots who can't make up their own minds. The RNC's tactics were so obvious that even the most casual observer could see what was going on. Whenever Rubio spoke, the audience would overreact with applause and cheers, while Trump was met with silence. This was a clear attempt to make Rubio look like the more popular candidate, and to undermine Trump's support. However, this tactic backfired, as it only made Trump look like the victim of a biased establishment. The moderators were also clearly biased against Trump. They asked him leading questions that were designed to make him look bad, while giving Rubio and Cruz softball questions. This was a clear attempt to make Rubio and Cruz look like the more serious candidates, while making Trump look like a clown. However, this tactic also backfired, as it only made Trump look like the victim of a biased media. The RNC's tactics were not limited to the debate itself. They have been using similar tactics throughout the campaign, trying to stack the deck against Trump and other anti-establishment candidates. This is a mistake, as it only makes the Republican Party look like a bunch of blustering children who can't handle a fair fight. The RNC's tactics are also hurting the party's chances of winning the general election. By treating the base like idiots, they are alienating the very people they need to win. The base is tired of being told what to think and who to support. They want a candidate who will listen to them and represent their interests, not the interests of the establishment. As a super liberal, I find the RNC's tactics to be particularly offensive. They are treating the base like idiots, and trying to manipulate them into supporting candidates who don't represent their interests. This is not how democracy is supposed to work. We should be encouraging people to think for themselves, not telling them what to think. The RNC's tactics are also hurting the Republican Party's chances of winning the general election.
