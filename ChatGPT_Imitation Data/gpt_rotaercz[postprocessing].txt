Hey everyone, I just wanted to say thank you for all the feedback on my previous post. I really appreciate all the constructive criticism and suggestions. I've taken them all into consideration and have made some changes to my post-processing workflow. Firstly, I've made sure to white balance all my images before doing any further editing. This has helped to ensure that the colors are accurate and consistent across all my photos. I've also realized that split-toning doesn't always work for every image, so I've been more careful with that technique and only use it when it's appropriate. One thing that I've been trying to focus on is the overall flow of my post-processing. I want to have a consistent approach to editing all my photos, rather than just randomly tweaking each one. I've been trying to learn more about the different techniques and tools available in Photoshop and Lightroom, and how to use them effectively. I know that everyone has different post-processing goals, and mine is to achieve a more rugged and natural look for my photos. I take thousands of pictures at weddings, so I can't spend too much time on each individual photo. Instead, I'm approaching it on a larger macro scale and trying to create an action that can do a lot of the tweaks for me. This will help me to batch process hundreds of images at a time, while still maintaining a certain level of quality. I've also realized that it's really easy to overdo it on post-processing, especially when you've been staring at the same image for a long time. That's why it's important to get another person's opinion and have them look at the image from a neutral standpoint. This can help to prevent you from going too far with your edits and ruining the image. One thing that I've been struggling with is cutting people out cleanly. I've seen some amazing examples of this on this subreddit, and I'm wondering if anyone has any tips or tutorials on how to do this effectively. I've tried using the lasso tool and the pen tool, but I still end up with jagged edges and messy cuts. I've also been trying to learn more about different post-processing styles and techniques. I've noticed that a lot of people seem to be going for that vintage, airy look, but that's not really what I'm going for. I want to create images that are a bit darker and moodier, and that use shadows effectively. If anyone has any links or resources that they could recommend, I would really appreciate it. I've been using Photoshop for most of my editing, but I've also been trying to learn more about Lightroom. I've found that the workflow for Lightroom isn't always easy to understand, but I'm willing to put in the time to learn it. I've also been experimenting with different tools and techniques in Photoshop, such as the black and white adjustment layer and highlight crushing. One thing that I've been struggling with is exporting my images. I have a lot of different versions of the same image, and I want to make sure that I'm saving all the changes that I've made up to that point. I've tried exporting as a JPEG, but it doesn't always save all the changes that I've made. If anyone has any tips or tutorials on how to export images effectively, I would really appreciate it. Overall, I'm really enjoying the process of learning and experimenting with different post-processing techniques. I know that I still have a lot to learn, but I'm excited to continue improving and creating beautiful images. Thank you again to everyone who has provided feedback and support. It's always great to be part of such a talented and helpful community.
