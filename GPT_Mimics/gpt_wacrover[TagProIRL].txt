The ability to convert matter into energy and then back into matter again. It's a concept that has always fascinated me, but I've come to realize that it's not just a scientific theory, it's a metaphor for life. We all have the power to transform ourselves, to take what we have and turn it into something greater. And that's what I've been trying to do, both in the short term and the long term. In the short term, I've set myself some goals. They may seem small, but they're important to me. First, I want to learn how to solve a Rubik's Cube. It's a challenge that's been bugging me for years, and I'm determined to crack it. Second, I want to get my time down to sub-20 minutes. I know it's not world record pace, but it's a personal best that I'm striving for. Third, I want to go to a comedy club. I've always loved stand-up comedy, and I think it's time I experienced it live. Fourth, I want to get to over 30 tosses in a single juggle. It's a skill that I've been working on for a while, and I'm getting closer every day. And finally, I want to do all of these things with a smile on my face, because life is too short to be miserable. But it's not just about the short term. I have long-term goals too. First and foremost, I want to continue to stay stronger than the depression that has plagued me for years. It's a battle that I fight every day, but I'm determined to win. Second, I want to keep the company that I've built from the ground up running and keep people in a job and my family supported. It's not easy being an entrepreneur, but it's worth it when you see the impact you can have on people's lives. Third, I want to strengthen my relationship with my wife and keep her happy. She's been my rock through thick and thin, and I want to make sure she knows how much I appreciate her. And finally, I want to do right by my son, give him everything I can, and be a good father. It's the most important job I'll ever have, and I take it seriously. I know that life can be tough. There are days when it feels like everything is against you, when you're struggling just to get out of bed. But I believe that we all have the power to transform ourselves, to take what we have and turn it into something greater. It's not easy, but it's worth it. And that's what I'm striving for every day. I've been asked what my daily life is like, how I'm able to not have an ounce of physical human contact. It's not easy, but it's something that I've learned to live with. I have my family, my friends, and my work to keep me busy. And I have the internet, which has opened up a whole world of possibilities for me. I can connect with people from all over the world, share my thoughts and ideas, and learn from others. It's not the same as physical human contact, but it's something. I've also been asked about my thoughts on downvoting and negativity on the internet. It's a tough subject, because on the one hand, I believe in free speech and the right to express your opinion. But on the other hand, I think that there's a lot of unnecessary negativity out there. It's easy to hide behind a screen and say things that you wouldn't say in person. And it's easy to get caught up in the negativity and forget that there are real people behind those usernames. I've seen it happen time and time again, where someone posts something innocuous and gets downvoted into oblivion for no apparent reason. It's not fair, and it's not productive. We should be using the internet to connect with each other, to share our ideas and learn from each other. We should be building each other up, not tearing each other down. I've also been asked about how to help someone who is experiencing abuse. It's a tough subject, and there's no easy answer. But I believe that the most important thing you can do is be there for them. Listen to them, support them, and let them know that they're not alone. Encourage them to seek help, whether it's from a therapist, a support group, or a trusted friend or family member. And most importantly, don't judge them. It's not their fault, and they need your support now more than ever. Finally, I've been asked about my thoughts on the role of the admins on Reddit. It's a complicated issue, and I don't have all the answers. But I do believe that the admins have a responsibility to the community. They should be working to make Reddit a better place, to root out spam and abuse, and to support the moderators who keep the site running. And they should be doing it in a transparent and accountable way. I know that there are a lot of frustrations with the admins, and I share some of those frustrations. But I also believe that we can work together to make Reddit a better place. We can hold the admins accountable, we can demand transparency, and we can work together to build a community that we can all be proud of. In conclusion, I believe that we all have the power to transform ourselves, to take what we have and turn it into something greater. It's not easy, but it's worth it. And I believe that we can use the internet to connect with each other, to share our ideas and learn from each other. We can build each other up, not tear each other down. And we can work together to make Reddit a better place.
