The No Fly List: A Flawed System The No Fly List is a controversial topic that has been in the news for years. The list is a government database of individuals who are not allowed to board commercial flights in or out of the United States. The list is supposed to be a tool to prevent terrorism, but it has been criticized for being ineffective and for violating the rights of innocent people. It takes some pretty twisted logic to criticize using the No Fly List while at the same time supporting its use, all while calling one's opponents "unreasonable." Personally, I'm not a big fan of the initial idea either - banning folks from flying based on a government "hunch" smacks of precrime. Anyone who has had a basic government or history class understands that throwing out the laws and the Constitution and justifying every decision based on someone in power's idea of the "greater good" is the road that leads to tyranny and oppression. What's just insane to me is that when watching the mainstream media, no one ever mentions this point. Democrats and Republicans support or oppose the idea for various reasons, but hardly anyone seems to mention "due process", the Constitution, or the fatal flaws in the No Fly List. I think it's a clever political approach by Obama (other than the whole Constitutional part...): Most Democrats (broadly generalizing here) won't criticize the No Fly List over this point because they want increased more gun control, and politically this seems like a good way to get that, so they ignore the fact that it's a flagrant violation of the right to due process. Most Republicans (broadly generalizing here) won't criticize the No Fly List because they really don't care about due process when it comes to Muslims, suspected terrorists, people who aren't like them, etc. The No Fly List is a flawed system that has been criticized by many people. The list is supposed to be a tool to prevent terrorism, but it has been criticized for being ineffective and for violating the rights of innocent people. The list is secret, there is no transparency for the process of getting on it, and no due process for contesting it if you've been added to the list in error. The No Fly List is a violation of the right to due process. Currently, the terror watch list is secret, there is no transparency for the process of getting on it, and no due process for contesting it if you've been added to the list in error. It's pretty sickening how much Republicans, Democrats, and pretty much everyone is trying to ride this terror fear to advance their own agendas. The No Fly List is a flawed system that needs to be reformed.
