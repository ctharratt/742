Resident Evil 6: A Game in Need of Improvement Resident Evil 6 is a game that has been both praised and criticized by fans of the series. On one hand, it is the second best-selling Resident Evil game, with 6.4 million copies sold. On the other hand, many players have found the game's menu system to be confusing and the gameplay to be too action-oriented. As a fan of the series, I believe that Resident Evil 6 has its strengths, but it is also a game that is in need of improvement. One of the biggest issues with Resident Evil 6 is its menu system. When players start the game, they are presented with a confusing array of options that can be overwhelming for many. I believe that Capcom should rework the main menu in RE6 so that players are presented with more user-friendly options. For example, the Auto Action Button, which has possibly been improved in some way, and the FOV sliders and laser sight settings should be presented when players start the game. This would make it easier for players to customize their gameplay experience and get into the game more quickly. Another issue with Resident Evil 6 is its focus on action over survival horror. While the game has its share of tense moments, it is clear that the developers were more interested in creating an action-packed experience than a horror one. This is a departure from the earlier games in the series, which were known for their emphasis on survival horror. I believe that Capcom should find a way to strike a better balance between action and horror in future Resident Evil games. One way to do this would be to take inspiration from the Outbreak series. I can't help feeling that Resident Evil 6 was meant to be in some ways a spiritual successor to Outbreak. Not just because they were directed by the same man, but the multiple overlapping campaigns. The problem with the Outbreak series is that Outbreak 2 was something of a flop, which led to Outbreak 3 being cancelled. However, there's a chance it might come back if something comes of the remaster rumors. The fault likely lies with Valve. I believe that Capcom should take a closer look at the Outbreak series and find ways to incorporate its survival horror elements into future Resident Evil games. Another issue with Resident Evil 6 is its reliance on melee combat. In earlier games, even the action-oriented Resident Evil 5, running out of bullets forced players to flee. In Resident Evil 6, the player can unleash a flurry of punches, kicks, melee counters, and head slams. In some cases, an unarmed player with a knife/prod is more deadly than one using firearms. While this can be fun, it takes away from the survival horror elements of the game. I believe that Capcom should find a way to make firearms more important in future Resident Evil games. One game that I believe strikes a good balance between action and horror is Resident Evil Revelations 2. They rip you out of your comfort zone. They barely give you enough resources to clear certain areas, but you can still get through if you hussle. Revelations 2 tries to find a balance between action and more traditional design elements. As I'm fond of pointing out, it lifts a lot of ideas from Alan Wake, but it isn't as ammo happy as Alan Wake was. And the chief difference from RE6 is that Revelations 2 characters can't casually knife fight their way out of the zombie apocalypse. This is of course significantly less "cool" and "good feeling" than RE6, but I think this design approach is extremely important in setting Revelations 2 apart from the action-oriented mainline games. Another issue with Resident Evil 6 is its use of stealth mechanics. While I think the stealth was an interesting concept, it should have been more effectively used. Sneaking up on enemies, hiding in closets, hiding in trash bins. Resident Evil 6 has these things, but they're mostly limited to specific scenarios the developers anticipated. Hence you can only hide in closets in China, and they're only useful when playing as Sherry. One problem lies in gelling stealth with cooperative-supporting design and/or an AI partner. The Evil Within's hiding in closets and sneaking up behind enemies works a bit better, although it can be frustrating at times, because you're solo. In Ada Wong's campaign, we get a glimpse of being able to watch enemy patrol patterns and sneak up behind them for a killing blow. The Evil Within tried this exact same design idea, but with single-use melee items that could only be used if you snuck directly behind an enemy, and enemies that would chase after you if you spotted you, forcing you to hide behind/under/inside something and wait. As I said, TEW was frustrating at times because of its stealth system. I thought the stealth was interesting conceptually, but should have been more effectively used. In conclusion, Resident Evil 6 is a game that has its strengths, but it is also a game that is in need of improvement. Capcom should rework the main menu in RE6 so that players are presented with more user-friendly options. They should also find a way to strike a better balance between action and horror in future Resident Evil games. Firearms should be made more important, and the use of stealth mechanics should be more effectively used. By addressing these issues, Capcom can create a Resident Evil game that is both fun and scary, and that will appeal to both action and survival horror fans.
