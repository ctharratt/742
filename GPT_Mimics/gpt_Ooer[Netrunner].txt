Oh man, where do I even start? I just had my first ever match on jinteki.net and it was amazing! I mean, I usually avoid 1v1 online games because let's face it, running into a bad egg is never fun. But this time, I met the nicest person ever! The netrunner community is just awesome, you know?  And can we talk about the buying guide? It's totally out of date now. I mean, I would guess that the first cycle would become non-tournament legal early 2018, which still gives you two whole years of playing with highly competitive cards. That's like, a lot of time to get your game on. And even after 2018 hits, you can still use those cards casually. I mean, who doesn't love a good casual game, am I right?  But wait, there's more! I'm sure some places will hold legacy tournaments too. I mean, that's just awesome. It's like, you get to keep playing with your favorite cards even after they're not tournament legal anymore. And let's be real, some of those cards are just too good to let go of.  I can't believe how much I enjoyed my first match on jinteki.net. I mean, I was a little nervous at first, but my opponent was just so nice. It's like, I didn't even care if I won or lost (although let's be real, winning is always better). It was just so much fun to play with someone who was as passionate about the game as I am.  And can we talk about the netrunner community for a second? I mean, these people are just awesome. They're so welcoming and friendly, and they really know their stuff. I feel like I learned so much just from that one match. It's like, I didn't even know half the cards my opponent was playing, but they were so patient and explained everything to me.  I can't wait to play more matches on jinteki.net. I mean, I'm still a little nervous about running into a bad egg, but I feel like the chances of that happening are pretty low. Everyone I've met so far has been so nice and welcoming.  And let's not forget about the buying guide. I mean, it's seriously out of date now. But that's okay, because there are still so many great cards to play with. I mean, I'm not even close to having all the cards yet, but I feel like I have a pretty good collection so far. And with two whole years of playing with highly competitive cards, I feel like I have plenty of time to build up my collection even more.  I can't wait to see what the netrunner community has in store for the future. I mean, legacy tournaments? That's just awesome. And who knows what other cool stuff they'll come up with. All I know is that I'm excited to be a part of it.  In conclusion, my first match on jinteki.net was amazing. The netrunner community is awesome, the buying guide is out of date but that's okay, and I can't wait to play more matches and see what the future holds. Thanks for reading my ramblings, and I hope to see you on jinteki.net soon!
