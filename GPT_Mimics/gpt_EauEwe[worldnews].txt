Probability is a fascinating subject that can be difficult to grasp for some people. It involves understanding the likelihood of an event occurring and using mathematical formulas to calculate the probability of that event happening. One interesting comparison that has been made is the probability of a random American dying in a plane crash versus becoming President in their lifetime. At first glance, it may seem like the odds of becoming President are much higher than dying in a plane crash. After all, there have been fewer than 50 people elected President, while millions of Americans travel by plane every year. However, when you look at the actual statistics, the opposite is true. In 2010, there were 1,301,013,967 American airline passengers, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Of those, there were 22 fatalities, according to Plane Crash Info. This means that the incidence rate of dying in a plane crash for an American in 2010 was 1.69*10-8. On the other hand, there were 52,463,817 age-appropriate, native-born citizens in 2010, according to the US Census. There was only one President during that time, according to the same source. This means that the incidence rate of becoming President for an American in 2010 was 1.91*10-8. So, as an American in 2010, you had a higher chance of becoming President than dying in a plane crash. This may seem counterintuitive, but it is important to understand the difference between sheer numbers of occurrences and ratios. For example, let's say you and a friend have a dice-rolling contest. You have to roll a 1, 2, or 3 every time or you lose. Your friend has to roll a 1 or 2 every time or he loses. Who has the greater chance of winning? You do, obviously, because you have a 2/3 chance of winning each time you roll. Your friend only has a 1/3 chance of winning each time he rolls. Now, let's say your friend gets to roll five times more frequently than you. Would his odds improve? No, not at all. His probability of losing is still 2/3. This is because for every circumstance of winning that he adds with each additional roll (a 1 or 2), he also adds more circumstances for losing (3, 4, 5, or 6). This same principle applies to the plane crash versus President comparison. Each plane trip adds more people to the pool of potential plane crash victims, but it also adds way more people who will not die from a plane crash. And the ratio of these two pools is far, far lower than the ratio for presidential election. It is important to note that these statistics are based on a specific year and do not take into account other factors that may affect the likelihood of dying in a plane crash or becoming President. For example, if there were a sudden increase in plane crashes or a sudden decrease in the number of people running for President, the probabilities would change. Additionally, it is important to understand that statistics cannot be manipulated. They are simply numbers that represent the likelihood of an event occurring. However, inferences drawn from those numbers can be manipulated or misinterpreted. It is important to use accurate data and understand the limitations of statistical analysis. In conclusion, while it may seem like the odds of becoming President are much lower than the odds of dying in a plane crash, the opposite is actually true. This is because probability is not just about sheer numbers of occurrences, but about ratios. Understanding this concept is important for accurately interpreting statistical data and making informed decisions based on that data.
