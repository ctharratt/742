I just don't understand why people hate on cruise ships so much. I mean, sure they can be a bit of an eyesore in some places, but in others, like Kotor, they're actually part of the reason the place is so beautiful. The natural harbor is what has allowed Kotor to thrive and maintain its charm over the years. And let's be real, it's much better to have pleasure vessels docked there than navy vessels like they had 100 years ago. That being said, I was lucky enough to score a day to hike up to Kotor when there weren't any cruise ships in port (except for some seriously big private yachts). And let me tell you, the place is even more stunning without all the crowds. I highly recommend taking the time to explore Kotor and the surrounding area, whether you're on a cruise or not. Now, if you're looking for some other romantic destinations in Europe, I can certainly vouch for Gent (Ghent) and Bruges (Brugge). Bruges may have become a bit overrun with tourists since the movie, but it's still one of the cutest cities I've ever been to. And as a couple, you'll love wandering the streets and taking in all the sights. But if you're looking for a bit more activity, monuments, and restaurants, then Gent is the way to go. Plus, it's got a university which helps give the city a bit more of a buzz. I was there in August and had a blast. If you're looking for a cool cafe to check out, I highly recommend Hot Club De Gand. Don't be put off by the dodgy alleyway to get there, it's totally worth it. If you're planning a trip to Flanders, I highly recommend doing a First World War tour of some sort. It's the single most significant event to occur in Belgium (at least in the last century) so it would be a shame to ignore it. Plus, Ypres is a great place to visit and any tour will take you there (or you may want to stay there for a night). And when it comes to food, always ask a local for recommendations. They know the best spots. Now, if you're planning on driving from the Lepetane/Kemanari ferry crossing to Kotor at night, let me warn you, it's not for the faint of heart. I did it and it was one of the most challenging experiences I've had in Europe. If you're not staying in that part of the bay (like we were in Prcanj), I would recommend taking the scenic route instead. It takes about the same amount of time to get to Kotor town and it's much more relaxed. Just be aware that there are loads of police around with radars, so watch your speed. And if you're looking for picture postcard Germany, most people tend to head south. Places like Rothenburg OdT and FÃ¼ssen are tourist destinations for a reason, but they're still lovely to see. Munich itself is also a great city with plenty to offer, including beer halls (beer, sausage, pork knuckle, beer, pretzel, sauerkraut, beer). But for me, Berlin is where it's at. The city has so much history and culture to explore, and the public transportation is easy to navigate. I highly recommend doing a "Third Reich" walking tour to learn about the city's significant past. And don't miss the Checkpoint Charlie museum, Museum Island, Tiergarten, Brandenburg Gate, and Bundestag. The East Side Gallery is also a must-see, as it's a part of the Berlin Wall that's been turned into an art project/monument. It's surreal to think about what it must have been like to be in a divided city, just across the river from somewhere you weren't allowed to go. And if you have time for a day trip, check out Potsdam for some beautiful architecture. Finally, if you're visiting during the World Cup, be prepared for every bar and restaurant to have a TV showing the football. But even if you're not a fan, there's still plenty to see and do in Berlin. So go ahead and check out all these places, and don't be afraid to ask locals for recommendations. You never know what hidden gems you might discover.
