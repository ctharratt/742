Why would swallowing food be bad for his palate? I mean, I get it, you want to savor the flavors and all that, but come on, sometimes you just want to scarf down a burger or a slice of pizza. And let's be real, who has time to chew their food 20 times before swallowing? Ain't nobody got time for that. Speaking of food, let's talk about Girl Scout cookies. Samoas were always my favorite, after Thin Mints of course. But I haven't sold or bought any in years, so who knows if they're still the most popular. Maybe they've come out with some new flavor that's taken over the top spot. I wouldn't be surprised, those Girl Scouts are always coming up with new ideas. Now, let's switch gears and talk about introductions. I recently saw this band and the person introducing them just did a quick 30 second intro. I mean, what's the point of that? If you're going to introduce someone, you might as well give them a proper introduction. But then again, maybe I'm just old-fashioned. Speaking of things I don't understand, who the hell is this person that everyone's talking about? I had to look them up and still don't really get it. But hey, at least there's a website that can help me with the pronunciation. That's pretty cool. Moving on to something more entertaining, Ellen's laugh is just the best. I could listen to her laugh all day. And speaking of things that make you feel good, have you ever tried shrooms? I hear that 4g is the minimum needed to get hallucinatory effects. But anything below 2g just seems pointless to me. If you're going to do shrooms, you might as well go all the way and do 4g. Now, let's talk about something that's been bothering me. I saw this video of some actors goofing around on the set of a movie and this one guy was just so cringey. I don't understand why his videos have so many views. It's just a bunch of awkward 15-year-old boys trying to learn how to pick up chicks. Who wants to watch that? Let's switch gears again and talk about emojis. I personally love the Apple and Samsung ones the best. They just look the most realistic to me. But hey, to each their own. Now, let's talk about something that's been in the news lately - clear backpacks in schools. I've heard that in really bad schools, students are required to use clear backpacks or no backpacks at all. That just seems ridiculous to me. What's the point of having a backpack if you can't even carry your stuff in it? And having to switch books at your locker between classes? That just sounds like a hassle. Speaking of things that are awesome, have you ever done Reddit gifts? I recently did it and my secret santa was from Vermont. She sent me these maple syrup candies that were just amazing. I definitely overindulged on those. Now, let's talk about something that's a little controversial - bacon and syrup. I've heard of it as a joke or an unusual dish, but do people actually eat that regularly? I'm not sure I could handle that combination. Moving on to something more practical, I recently found a free anti-malware program. That's pretty cool, right? And speaking of cool things, I love cover songs. Especially when they're done by someone like Nirvana. I recently heard a version of one of their songs and it was just amazing. Now, let's talk about someone who's just a genuine guy - that actor who had a rough start but went on to be successful. I'm glad he didn't let his past hold him back and was able to make something of himself. Speaking of things that can be painful, have you ever tried waxing? My cousin used to do it and it looked difficult and messy, but also cheaper than shaving. Maybe I should give it a try. But then again, I'm scared of the pain. Maybe I should start with a bikini wax and work my way up to a Brazilian. Speaking of things that are painful, have you ever watched a waxing video? It's painful just to watch. But the end result is great, so maybe it's worth it. I've done full legs, bikini line, armpits, and upper lip. The armpits always bleed and the upper legs and back of thighs hurt a lot. But it's pretty convenient if you're interested, and most places offer a package deal. Now, let's talk about something that's been on my mind lately - Disney movies. They always make them kid-friendly and leave out the more adult themes. But hey, that's their thing. And speaking of things that are lovely, have you seen those acapella Disney covers? They're just amazing. Moving on to something more serious, let's talk about the environment. In DC, there's a 5 cent charge for plastic bags and they recently banned styrofoam takeout containers. That's a step in the right direction. Now, let's talk about something that's just fun - video games. I recently saw a Kickstarter for a card game that looked really cool. But I'm not sure I want to pay money towards something that might not even happen. Why can't they just start selling the cards? And finally, let's talk about something that's been in the news lately - Chris Brown and Mike Tyson. It's interesting to see the difference in response that Reddit has towards them. But hey, I'm just an objective observer. In conclusion, there's a lot of things to talk about in this world. From food to introductions to waxing, there's always something to discuss. And that's what makes life interesting.
