As a die-hard NBA fan, I can't help but feel a sense of disappointment when I think about the lack of footage from some of the greatest players in the league's history. It's a shame that players like Mike, Bill, Magic, and Larry may not be remembered as vividly in future conversations about NBA greatness because of the quality or complete lack of footage. I mean, can you imagine if we had footage of James "Flight" White doing a between the legs dunk from the free throw line? That's a feat that deserves to be immortalized in the annals of basketball history. But alas, we may never get to see it. Speaking of missed opportunities, it's also a shame that we didn't record games on film instead of tape. Tape degrades over time, and we've already lost so much footage of some of the greatest moments in NBA history. It's a tragedy that we may never get to see some of those moments again. But let's talk about the present for a moment. As awesome as it is to see players like Kevin Durant dominating on the court, I can't help but feel a sense of sadness when I think about players like Derrick Rose. It's clear that he's done, and even if he does come back, it will only be briefly before he tears his other ACL within 20 games. I'm curious about what will happen to his Bulls contract and his shoe contract. Will they still pay him even though he can't play for the year? It's a tough situation, and I hope that he's taken care of financially. On a lighter note, I'm excited to watch some basketball during the Olympics. I'm hoping to catch a game soon, but it's been tough trying to figure out when they're being played locally for me. I'm in Australia, so the time difference can be a bit tricky. Speaking of Australia, did you know that one of their athletes did a naked calendar for the 2000 games? I love me some tall girls, so that's definitely something I need to check out. In fact, one of my greatest moments on earth was when I dropped a friend off at Sydney International and got to give Lauren Jackson a hug. She smells like rainbows and has buns of steel! I didn't have the heart to tell her that she was brushing the Jackson off as she walked past. But let's get back to basketball. It's a shame that Blake Griffin is out for the entire Olympics. I'm curious about what will happen to his $100 million plus MVP supplement contract while he's doing nothing all year. Does he still get paid? What if he never comes back? It's a tough situation, and I hope that he's taken care of financially as well. As someone who is always afraid of getting sacked, I can't help but worry about what will happen to players like Rose and Griffin. It's a tough world out there, and injuries can be devastating both physically and financially. But let's talk about some of the greats for a moment. I'm curious about what Chris Webber did to make people from Chicago hate him. I've heard a lot of negative things about him, but I'm not sure what he did to earn that reputation. And speaking of the Bulls, it's clear that they won't be winning a championship anytime soon. Ever since Rose snapped his leg off, he's been done. Even if he does come back, he'll be a glass cannon, and he'll likely snap his other leg off within the first few months of 2014. It's a terrible shame, but he has the biggest sneaker contract and team contract to add to his "greatest coulda been ever" legacy. "Too big, too strong, too fast, too good" not anymore and never again. His jumper isn't that good, and he won't be spending any time in the paint with his busted ass old man leg in the future. But let's not end on a negative note. Basketball is a beautiful game, and there are so many amazing players out there. I'm excited to see what the future holds for the NBA, and I'm hopeful that we'll get to see some more amazing moments that will be remembered for years to come.
