Yo, what's up Rust players? It's your boy, Rusty McRustface, back at it again with some thoughts on the game. So, I was playing the other day and I had this realization - if you're in a shootout with someone, your hands are pretty vulnerable. Like, 25% of the shots they're gonna hit are gonna be your hands. So, it's better to be safe than sorry and upgrade that wall to wood so your masterpiece base isn't destroyed by some asshole with a bow. Speaking of assholes with bows, have you guys seen Killerbong's latest video? I'm usually not a fan of his stuff, but damn, that compilation was amazing. It's like the greatest Rust video of all time. And then Trausi releases a new video and I'm like, "Come get me, bitch!" I play on Rustralasia, by the way. And can we just take a moment to appreciate how awesome Bchillz and Zuckles are? But then Trausi comes along and blows them out of the water. Fucking A. But enough about videos, let's talk about the game itself. I've been having some issues with my keyboard lately. Whenever I try to press my 123456 keys, they're unresponsive or only bring up the item for a second before disappearing. It's really frustrating and I don't know how to fix it. Any suggestions? Also, have you guys ever gone up against Cortex? They're the worst clan on Rustralasia and I really want to help someone take them down. Let me know if you need backup. Oh, and speaking of weapons, where's the trigger on the semi-auto rifle? I swear, I will never understand how some of you guys do this. And have you seen my latest base design? It's like a fortress, man. I AM SHODAN. But enough about me, let's talk about the community. I think we need a subreddit dedicated to Rust stories. I love reading about people's experiences in the game and I think it would be a great addition to the community. Or just more stories in general. I fucking love these. And can we all just take a moment to thank whoever finally killed Froxer? That guy was a menace. Damn, I miss Chapelle's Show. And that's why I always let the heli kill me if I'm at my base. Safety first, people. But seriously, how do you wear these new skins? Is this for real? Can someone else confirm? And which server is that lovely psychopath on? I need to avoid that guy at all costs. And can we just talk about that ending to the video? Upvoted for that alone. Damn you, Froxxer! You've killed me too many times! But let's not forget about the game mechanics. As long as steam chat and TS are a thing, groups of players will always reign over solos. It's just the way it is. But I still love you guys. Please make more videos. And can we talk about the recent changes to the game? Swapping the explosive rounds from the ammo to the shotgun? Really? Well, so long to the only good early game advantage. And can we please have more mountainous areas and valleys where people can hide their houses like they used to? I always built my house in the rocks in the old Rust. And speaking of building, I think we need a better system for moving boxes. It should be possible to move them even when there are items inside, but carrying the box should disable the player from doing anything else. And when you first place the box, it should appear as the blue shaded box in front of you when moving it. Just a thought. And can we talk about the recent controversy with the voice chat? I think it would be weird to have my voice coming out of a woman's body, but I also understand the desire for more options. Maybe there could be a choice to be a man or a woman? I don't know, I just wanna play the game. And finally, let's talk about raiding. I think it would be cool if there were more events like the ones on the Psisyndicate server where traders have to trust each other and there's always a risk of betrayal. It adds a whole new level of tension to the game. Well, that's all for now, Rust players. Keep on surviving and let's hope for some more awesome updates in the future. Rusty McRustface out.
