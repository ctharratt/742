I gotta say, this whole banning of subreddits thing really gets my goat. I mean, isn't Reddit supposed to be a place where free speech reigns supreme? So why are they banning subreddits left and right? It just doesn't make sense to me. Now, I'm not saying that people should be allowed to doxx or harass others on the site. That's just not cool. But if someone is doing that, then ban them, not the entire subreddit. It's like punishing the whole class for the actions of one student. It's just not fair. And what about those who are offended by certain subreddits? Look, if you know that a subreddit is going to offend you, then don't go there. It's that simple. You don't need to stir up drama and get the whole thing shut down. That's just ridiculous. Speaking of drama, did you hear about the whole thing with Fonda and the Vietnam War? Yeah, she messed up, but she wasn't the only one protesting that war. There were plenty of American kids who were being drafted and were going to Canada on Conscientious Objector status. It was a crazy time, man. But let's switch gears here for a minute. Have you heard about Yao Ming's birth? Apparently, communist officials had been tracking his family for two generations, all in the hopes of boosting national pride through sports. I mean, is there any proof of this? It sounds like something out of a spy movie. And speaking of movies, have you read The Lord of the Rings? I mean, the books are so much better than the movies. Tolkien created this whole world that is just so varied and complete. The Silmarillion goes into the Valar, how "Earth" was created, and the history of the people of Middle Earth. It's just amazing. But let's get back to the real world for a minute. Did you know that toxoplasmosis and pregnancy are not a good combination? Yeah, it's pretty scary stuff. And don't even get me started on radiation-induced mutations. I mean, the Chernobyl accident was just insane. The land is coming back, but it's still hot as hell. And what about sex in movies? I mean, why can't we have good solid scripts and excellent production, but with porn? I'm not talking about those crappy, no-plot porns. I'm talking about a legitimate drama where the producers aren't afraid of showing well-acted sex. It's like a new genre waiting to be invented. But I digress. Let's get back to the banning of subreddits. It's just not right, man. Reddit is supposed to be a place where people can express themselves freely. But if they keep banning subreddits left and right, then what's the point? It's like they're trying to censor us or something. And don't even get me started on the whole thing with the animals in the Chernobyl area. They're still highly radioactive from the soil around the reactor area getting in their fur/feathers/etc. It's just crazy. But you know what really grinds my gears? When people add text to my comments that I didn't actually type. It's like, come on, man. Let me speak for myself. And don't even get me started on April Fools' Day. It's just a bunch of nonsense. Anyway, I think I've rambled on enough for now. But seriously, Reddit needs to get its act together and stop banning subreddits. It's just not cool.
