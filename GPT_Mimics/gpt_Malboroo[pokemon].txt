Nintendo has been a household name for decades, and their games have been enjoyed by millions of people worldwide. However, their PR department has been a topic of discussion among gamers and reviewers alike. In my personal experience, I have had some frustrating encounters with Nintendo's PR department, particularly in Europe. I have been reviewing games for Nintendo for about 5-7 years, and I have always enjoyed the games they sent me for review. However, one day, when I requested a review copy of a game, they flat out said no. This was odd, as they had sent me numerous review copies before, and I had never written anything overly negative about the games I was sent. I understand that they have the right to refuse to supply me with a review copy, but it was frustrating to be suddenly dropped without any explanation. To make matters worse, every email I sent to them after that bounced, and I was unable to get any reason as to why I was suddenly dropped. This was around the time the 3DS came out, and they were planning on sending me a review unit. However, I never received a Nintendo review copy since then. I highly doubt that the Pokemon Company uses HostGator or their hosting, as the second link is HostGator. They can head to their local store and pick up an eShop card and an SD card at the same time. It was released on more than just the PC though. They can't. They can try though. The trademark will be rejected, but the Pokemon Company won't be able to register their own trademark until it has been. In all fairness, people would still buy special 3DS in droves. A digital release wouldn't hamper sales on that front. If you wanted to play Pokemon on the 3DS, you would have a console already. It is frustrating that Nintendo's PR department seems to be so inconsistent and unresponsive. I have heard similar stories from other reviewers and gamers, and it seems that Nintendo needs to improve their communication and transparency with their PR department. In terms of the recent release of Pokemon Sun and Moon, there has been a lot of speculation and excitement among fans. Some have even speculated that the Pokemon Company will announce that World of Warcraft will be updated to include Pokemon assets, allowing players to catch Pokemon in WoW. While this is just a rumor, it is an exciting prospect for fans of both franchises. However, there have also been some frustrations with the release of Pokemon Sun and Moon. Some fans have had difficulty obtaining the special Pokemon 2DS consoles that come pre-installed with the games. It seems that Nintendo of Europe has been very strict on distribution with these consoles, and some fans have been unable to get them shipped to their countries. Additionally, there have been issues with obtaining the special Mew PAL codes that were given out at certain stores. Some fans have reported that the codes were gone within seconds, and there have been rumors of bots snatching up the codes before real fans can get them. It is frustrating that some fans are unable to obtain these special items, and it seems that Nintendo could do more to ensure that they are distributed fairly. Overall, while Nintendo has been a beloved company for many years, there are certainly areas where they could improve. Their PR department could be more consistent and transparent, and they could do more to ensure that special items are distributed fairly to fans. However, despite these frustrations, fans continue to love and support Nintendo and their games.
