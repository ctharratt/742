As a political independent, I find myself constantly evaluating my interests and weighing my options when it comes to voting. I don't buy into the two-party dichotomy and instead judge my vote based on particular elections and the issues of the day. Sometimes I vote for only one party, other times I split. It all depends on how many issues I can see being achieved. For climate change issues, the Republican majority is bad for my interests. But the market and other countries have begun to make up ground. China, for example, is not stupid and is gunning for alternatives. Their coastal cities depend on them solving this issue. China is the top polluter in the world, but even if my interests are not being represented in Congress, the issue is being addressed by outside forces. Commercialization of renewables has been a long time coming, but within five years or so, full commercialization will be in swing. This is a single case of my interests being represented by outside forces and does not apply to every issue. Last election was a bit of a freak show, and almost perfectly represented me. Without the majority, Obama would not have issued his executive action. He needed to be trapped. The Republican majority is needed to represent my interests on Keystone XL and abortion. The minimum wage and marijuana legalization initiatives passed due to pragmatic Republican voters. The TPP can now move forward without a liberal block opposing it. The TPP's section on intellectual property is horrible, but there won't be much that can be done to enforce it. Piracy and technology will represent my interests on that issue. The net benefits of trade outweigh the negatives, and piracy will mitigate the negatives. Due to larger liberal influence in Congress, libertarians and liberals can move on prison population reduction without corporate Dems blocking the way. When you're on the fringes like me, you learn to see the outside forces representing you. Sometimes your interests are best represented when the party that agrees with you is on the run and is forced into executive action. Sometimes you just have to accept outside forces being your rep. Sometimes you side only with one party. The immigration debate is a great example. Obama could have dogged this fight had there been too much Dem influence in the Senate. Since there is no way for this Congress to pass reform, it falls on Obama's executive action. He may not have done what he did till he was forced like he is now. Sometimes your interests are best represented when the party that agrees with you is on the run and is forced into executive action. Sometimes you just have to accept outside forces being your rep. Sometimes you side only with one party. 2014 was really an anomaly for me. These two articles sum it up perfectly for the split nature of the things I support. Without Obama binding the Republicans together, their unity will be smashed. The worst thing that could happen to the Republican Party is if Christie or Jeb is elected in 2016. Without an enemy to fear, they must deal with their own internal enemies. Pushed to the edges, Democrats will have to deal with liberals. The conservatives are larger in size than the liberal faction of the Democrats, but being a smaller party, the Dems will fight tooth and nail with the progressives. This will set the stage for the strange bedfellows effect. Progressives can work with Green Tea Party Republicans. Libertarians can work with liberals on gay marriage. Blue Dog Dems can work with conservatives on repealing gay marriage. Bipartisan factionalism will become more effective than party unity when pushing agendas. The divisions within the parties will grow. It should take 10 more years for the full fracture of the traditional alliances to be seen in full. Could you support a pro-Wall Street, pro-fracking, anti-abortion, anti-gay rights, pro-nuclear, anti-union Democrat? I split my vote because I'm highly motivated on different issues. Climate change is a national security threat, but I'm also marginally pro-life. Christian democratic parties are very strong in Latin America and Europe. I'd like to see a Christian democratic party here. Not all who vote split are uninformed. Some of us know exactly what we are doing and vote to promote our agendas. Marijuana legalization in Alaska and gay marriage court battles will force libertarians and liberals to start working together. It's only a matter of time. When partisanship halts all political progress, political evolution begins to take place. Both parties will start evolving in odd ways to bypass this rabid partisanship. The most adaptable politics survive and reproduce. The most ideologically rigid politics will be selected out of the mainstream. As a Hispanic, I've been hearing about the drought in northern Mexico for a while. Many in my family are still farmers and need the water to survive. Here in California, we are experiencing a horrid drought as well. Most Latinos and Hispanics live in drought-prone states. We won't just sit back and watch our families and our states die of dehydration. One of the things that pisses me off the most is the NSA usage of water.  One more thing, fuck almonds. That's why I vote split and keep my ear to the ground when it comes to ballot initiatives. This is why I have to pinch my nose when I vote for Democrats. It's a shame the whole party doesn't denounce this police state. We have a mudslinger here. In due time, respect and earnest outreach from both camps to each other is needed. "I told you so" posts come from a place of tribal elitism.
