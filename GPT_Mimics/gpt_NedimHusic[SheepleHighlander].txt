Hey there, thanks for the update! I'm excited to hear that Skiftnycklar is interested in playing in the Pan tournament as well. I've gone ahead and edited the original post to include all the people who have expressed interest so far. It's always good to have some reserves just in case. I was wondering if you would be willing to lead the RSP team for the tournament? I'm not very good at melee and I already have my hands full organizing the UGC matches and scrims. If you're up for it, that would be great. For those who are interested in playing, you can download the custom maps we'll be using for the tournament: pl_barnblitz_pro, koth_artic, and pl_badwater_snowy. We already have Logophobia on board to play for us, but I did have a question - aren't you in TMM? And isn't TMM in the Round Robin too? I had planned on posting this thread next week, but I suppose this works just as well. I'll go ahead and post the signups next week instead. I remember our last scrim against TMM - it was a good match, but as far as I recall, they barely won it. No worries though, I've found a merc to fill in for us. Just let me know if anything changes and you won't be able to play on Sunday. On a different note, it's sad to see Gramm go, but thanks for all the games! Moving on, I'm thinking that we'll buy the game after our first playoff match next week. That means everyone will need to transfer 17.25 euro to our PayPal account (perhaps a bit more since PayPal takes a fee) and then I'll go buy it for us. So far, we have Helgrim, cXhristian, Spupy, and myself interested in buying a 4-pack. If anyone else wants to join in, just send me a message. Also, let's keep Prof. Gentleman's skills on the down-low, shall we? I've submitted the demo to Top 10 Plays and Helgrim submitted it to Moments of Glory. Hopefully, both Skifty's engie play and Helgrim's skills will get some recognition! Thanks for the info on our upcoming match against After.Dark [AD]. They won against us on koth_waste, so this will be a nice comeback for us. Also, it seems that this will NOT be pre-season after all. The map is pl_upward. I think we should play in silver for the next UGC season, especially now that we may have to find new subs who probably won't have much competitive experience. And if we win enough games, we'll end up in platinum anyway. More people are using the mumble, so we should probably change the password now. We'll need a heavy for the first match since Triton won't be playing. Could you play heavy? I'm still interested in playing in the Round Robin, even if we ran through each team last time. It's good practice for our pushing and regrouping skills. Do you know when the signups are? And would we be allowed in? I'm also interested in trying out Guild Wars 2. I haven't played it yet, but the people I've spoken to who have played it during the beta say it's a very good game. And the lack of a monthly subscription certainly helps. Lastly, I'm thinking of organizing an RUGC team event. My idea is to ask who's interested in being on the team, do a random draw to determine who will be the mains and who will be the subs, and then create a Steam group for them. Hopefully, the team leaders can practice and get ready among themselves. We can even get Janninge to do a small banner thingy on the server to advertise the event in advance, so people who want to watch can join the stream or use the Source TV. That's all for now. Thanks for reading and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
