Alright, let's get into it. So, I was thinking about the Axtinguisher and how it deals damage to burning targets. From what I understand, hitting a burning target deals 75 fire damage and puts out the fire, while also dealing 42 melee damage. That's a total of 117 damage. And if you crit a burning target, you can deal a whopping 351 damage. But if the target isn't burning, you only deal 42 damage, or 126 on a crit.  Now, the Axtinguisher currently deals 88 damage to burning targets from the front and 195 from the rear. Non-burning players take 33 damage. So, if you were to use a variant of the Axtinguisher that deals more damage to non-burning targets, you'd do around 27% more damage to them, 33% more damage to burning targets from the front, and 66% less damage to burning targets from the rear. Plus, you'd be able to get random crits, but you'd also be putting out the targets you hit, which could cost you between 3-57 damage over time.  Honestly, I'm not sure if I'd use this variant. I still think the powerjack with the degreaser and one of the sapper removal ones is the way to go. And I don't think the -10% swing speed on the variant is a big deal. It only slows your attack interval down by .08s, which isn't relevant 99% of the time. It's just a tiny downside that was probably added to stop people from complaining about it being a direct upgrade.  Now, let's talk about the Solemn Vow. I think it's a useful weapon for the Medic because it allows them to see the HP levels of players and choose to kill them if necessary. Apparently, 54% of Medics in pubs use the Ubersaw, which has a -20% swing speed. But swing speed is irrelevant on your first attack, and Medics get lots of melee crits. I personally use the Vow on my Medic at all times. I don't think it's underpowered, and I actually think the see HP should become a base Medic mechanic.  But your variant of the Vow severely reduces the combat potential of the Medic by cutting their speed when they aren't using the medi-gun. That's not something that would be fun for pub play. Plus, unless I'm pocketing one of my friends because they're having a bad day, chances are I'll be healing individuals that won't be able to take effective use of the information. I think you're severely overestimating the effectiveness of this variant. You'd provide your team with 60% of the enemies' remaining HP in healing, but you'd also be dramatically risking yourself. Medics get lots of crits due to the damage of their healing target applying to their crit chance. If you used a stock melee, you'd have a very good chance of one-hitting the person rather than leaving them alive.  Moving on to the BFB, I think it's a problematic weapon. The hitboxes don't match the player at times, and that's even worse with the BFB. And if a team has multiple engineers, you might die easier, but the other guy can repair your stuff. But what slot would the BFB variant take up? Or would it be an addition? Or do you mean +primary damage? Combined with the Escape Plan, you could possibly move at around 144% speed, which would be faster than the Scout. But at a certain point beyond the Scout's base speed of 135%, the hitboxes stop matching the player.  Increasing the radius of the Cow Mangler's charged shot wouldn't necessarily buff your damage much unless you tend to miss, and you'd take more incoming damage, which would mean each HP the Medic healed you for would be worth less. I think Medics would avoid healing individuals using the weapon because it hints that the player doesn't expect to be at high levels of HP or expects that having a better blast radius will increase their damage. It might be underpowered, but I'm not sure it wouldn't hit an appeal problem. Do I want to give up ~20 HP so I can move faster when I'm losing? Not really. Does an extra 10% explosion radius really matter to me? I think the rocket launcher's radius is plenty big for my purposes most of the time. And I'm not really sure I'd like fighting it either. The person will have a slightly easier time hitting me if they're overhealed, and they become harder to kill as they get close to death. Neither is really fun to fight.  As for the DDS, I think it might be better to revamp the weapon than to alter the damage. If the shield is supposed to reflect its name logically, the stats would be something more like:  Darwin's Danger Shield  Level 10 Shield  +35 Health  20% Critical Resistance  Regenerate 1 health per second  50% Critical damage dealt below 6/13ths of charge  15% Damage penalty on any attack that does not hit the head  The amount of charge to get full crit damage would be clearly marked (equivalent of 6/13 for the Huntsman). This leaves the player with 160 HP - effectively 200 vs pure critical hits. The player using this weapon is in roughly the same position if they're using the Sniper Rifle: until around 1.5s of charge, they can't kill the other party. The Huntsman would still be able to kill another Sniper, but it would be losing a significant amount of damage.  And finally, let's talk about the Phlogistinator. I was wondering if it would be possible to have a variant that doesn't require taunting to activate the crits, but instead has a time limit on the effect. Maybe around 8-10 seconds, or it could cost ammo additionally. And I think the damage should stay around 225-250. The damage per life would really depend on the build and map. If you're just Phlogging head-on, 200 is a significant amount of the damage you'll do in a life. But if you're just spamming the Scorch Shot, you can easily do 400 damage or more, but the damage doesn't necessarily kill anyone.  Overall, I think these variants could be interesting, but they would need some tweaking to be balanced and fun to play with and against. And who knows, maybe some of these ideas will make it into the game someday.
