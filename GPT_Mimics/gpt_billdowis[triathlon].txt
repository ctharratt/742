As a triathlete, there are a lot of things to consider when preparing for a race. From training to gear to race day logistics, it can be overwhelming. But with some careful planning and preparation, you can set yourself up for success. One of the first things to consider is your gear. While there are plenty of high-tech options out there, sometimes simple is better. For example, when it comes to shirts, I prefer a cotton shirt for regular wear and a tech shirt for training. However, I recently did a half marathon where they gave out both a short sleeve tech shirt and a long sleeve cotton shirt, both with nice designs that I'll actually wear. It's important to find what works for you and stick with it. When it comes to triathlons, it's important to remember that you're not just competing in one sport, but three. While it may be tempting to focus on just one sport and become great at it, being good at all three is what will ultimately lead to success. But with the rise of bike share programs in cities like Philadelphia, there has been an increase in inexperienced riders on the road, leading to frustration from drivers. It's important for both drivers and cyclists to understand the laws and share the road safely. When it comes to training for a triathlon, 40 weeks is usually enough time for most people. However, it's important to have the motivation and dedication to stick with it and complete the race. And on race day, it's always better to arrive early and take in the atmosphere rather than rushing and feeling stressed. As for gear, the Garmin 920xt is a popular choice among triathletes. While some races may not allow it, it's usually not an issue as long as it's used for live tracking and not texting while riding. But no matter how much training and preparation you do, there are always unexpected challenges on race day. For example, the water temperature may be colder than expected, or the swim may be more difficult than anticipated. It's important to stay focused and adapt to the situation. And while it's important to take the race seriously, it's also important to have fun and enjoy the experience. After all, the after party is often the most crowded place in the finish area. In the end, the key to success in a triathlon is preparation, dedication, and a willingness to adapt to unexpected challenges. With the right mindset and gear, you can achieve your goals and have a memorable race day experience.
