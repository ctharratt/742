I don't know about you, buddy, but I've been hearing a lot of crazy stories lately. And you know what they say, "That's just crazy enough to work!" Take, for example, the man wearing an "Obama is a nigger!" t-shirt. Now, that's kind of hilarious, in a way. It's an obvious fact stated as offensively as possible. It's like saying "Hillary Clinton has shit kids out her pussy!" or "George Bush does big turds out his honky white ass!" It's just so ridiculous that it's almost funny. But let's move on to something a little more serious. Did you know that Visa used to be owned as a co-op by the banks that issued cards? That's right, if you were a bank that wanted to issue a Visa card, you would join the co-op and become a part owner of the Visa organization. Of course, things have changed now. Visa is just a regular listed company. It used to be a co-operative, but now it's a publicly listed company. Now, let's talk about voting. What if there isn't someone you want to vote for? Well, you can always write "None of these candidates are any good" on the ballot. Or tear it up. Or write "I refuse to vote" or register as an objector. There are any number of ways you can have your objections heard. I mean, I forgot to vote in a council election once, and I just said that I did. It's not like they're going to come after you for not voting. And speaking of elections, did you know that Australia didn't send anyone for the 100m, 200m, or 400m at Munich? It's true. So, when people complain about not having enough representation in the Olympics, just remember that sometimes countries just don't have anyone good enough to compete. Now, let's talk about something a little more controversial. There's no evidence that Magic Johnson's daughter even died of AIDS. That Iraqi veterinarian told her it was an allergic reaction to penicillin. And you know what? I believe him. I mean, why would he lie about something like that? It just doesn't make sense. And while we're on the topic of controversial things, let's talk about evolution. Did you know that if you have eyes, you are related to every other organism with eyes? That's what a species is, closely related organisms. So, the next time someone tries to argue with you about evolution, just remember that we're all related in some way. Now, let's talk about something a little more lighthearted. Did you know that the Westboro Baptist Church spends much more on protests than they earn in lawsuits? It's true. They sue so they can afford to protest, not the other way around. I mean, it escapes me how people don't recognize this. It's just a typical Reddit spread myth, and the real world facts don't reflect that. And speaking of myths, did you know that the Venus flytrap is not the most printed biological organism in the world? In fact, there have been more than 127 cows in The Far Side. So, the next time someone tries to tell you that the Venus flytrap is the most printed biological organism in the world, just remember that they're wrong. Now, let's talk about something a little more personal. Generally, tattoos for medical purposes are legal. Most places allow tattoos on kids for medical reasons. So, if you want to get a tattoo for a medical reason, go ahead and do it. It's perfectly legal. And speaking of personal things, I found Paris to be beautiful, charming, exciting, romantic, and utterly pleasurable in every way. It didn't seem expensive or noticeably dirty either. So, the next time someone tries to tell you that Paris is overrated, just remember that they're wrong. Now, let's talk about something a little more unbelievable. Did you know that a crocodile can feel love towards a human? It's true. There's a man named Chito who had a crocodile that he loved and trained. And you know what? I believe him. I mean, why would he lie about something like that? It just doesn't make sense. And speaking of things that don't make sense, did you know that people who like spicy foods are not necessarily alcoholics? It's true. It's far more likely that people who like spicy foods don't understand correlation, statistics, and probability. So, the next time someone tries to tell you that you're an alcoholic because you like spicy foods, just remember that they're wrong. Now, let's talk about something a little more historical. Did you know that the Mormons and Native Americans were working together in the Wild West? It's true. And you know what? I think it's kind of cool. I mean, if you can't slaughter everyone in a wagon train, what's the point of even being in the West in the 1850s anyway? And speaking of history, did you know that the Bible doesn't actually mention an apple in the story of Adam and Eve? It's true. The fruit is never actually named. So, the next time someone tries to tell you that the fruit was an apple, just remember that they're wrong. Now, let's talk about something a little more controversial. Did you know that if all the presidents before Obama were black, he would be the first white president? It's true. And you know what? I think that's kind of funny. It just goes to show you that race is a social construct, not a biological one. And speaking of social constructs, did you know that Niue is not fully independent? It has a complicated relationship with New Zealand. NZ handles Niue's foreign affairs, which is usually considered the defining element of full independence. So, the next time someone tries to tell you that Niue is fully independent, just remember that they're wrong. And finally, let's talk about something a little more personal. Did you know that no one should be restricted from using general words, even in certain contexts? It's true. Usually, they are not. It is only if there is likely to be confusion among consumers that there would be an issue. So, the next time someone tries to tell you that you can't use a certain word, just remember that they're wrong. In conclusion, there are a lot of crazy stories out there. Some of them are true, and some of them are not. But the important thing is to keep an open mind and not be afraid to question what you hear. After all, the truth is out there, and it's up to us to find it.
