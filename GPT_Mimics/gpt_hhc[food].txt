I recently had the pleasure of indulging in some of the most delicious desserts I have ever tasted. From cranberry bliss bars to peanut butter toffee chocolate cookies to cranberry pistachio biscotti, every bite was bursting with flavor. And the best part? None of the flavors were overpowering, they all worked together in perfect harmony. But it wasn't just desserts that I had the pleasure of trying. I also had the opportunity to taste some savory dishes, such as chicken with corn and sesame. The broth was rich and flavorful, but I have to admit, it was a bit too much for me to finish. However, I still managed to eat plenty of it because it was just that good. One of the standout desserts for me was a piecaken. Yes, I know, the name is a bit ridiculous, but trust me, the taste more than makes up for it. The recipe came from a few different sources, including the Sweety Pies cookbook for the raspberry filling, the Butter cookbook for the chocolate cake and frosting, and a ganache recipe from another source. I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about the piecaken at first. I mean, a pie and a cake combined? It seemed like it could be a disaster. But I was pleasantly surprised. The raspberry filling cut through the richness of the chocolate perfectly, and the combination of the two was heavenly. The filling for the piecaken had a few unexpected spices, such as black pepper and allspice, which gave it a unique flavor that I wasn't used to in apple pie recipes. I couldn't quite tell if I could taste the bitters that were also included in the recipe, but either way, the filling was absolutely delicious. I also had the pleasure of trying a salted caramel apple pie from the Four and Twenty Blackbirds cookbook. The recipe was slightly tweaked to include more vanilla and salt to make it a butterscotch flavor. And let me tell you, the salted caramel was amazing. I even had some extra that I served on top of vanilla ice cream with the pie, and it was a match made in heaven. The cookbook also had a recipe for mini salted honey pies that I would love to try, but unfortunately, the bakery that sells them is only open until 4pm and is an hour away from me. Maybe one day I'll make the trek, but for now, I'll just have to settle for drooling over the recipe. One dessert that I was surprised to find myself loving was a blueberry galette. I had never had a galette before, but I was intrigued by the idea of a free-form pie. The crust was made with flour, sugar, salt, and lemon zest, and the filling was a mixture of blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, more lemon zest, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. The blueberries made the filling quite runny, but after letting it cool for a few hours, it eventually set thanks to the cornstarch. The crust was a bit scraggly around the edges, but that just added to the rustic charm of the galette. And let me tell you, it was absolutely delicious. Overall, my taste buds were in heaven after trying all of these amazing desserts and savory dishes. I highly recommend giving them a try if you ever have the chance. And who knows, maybe you'll discover a new favorite dessert or dish like I did.
