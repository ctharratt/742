Hey there! I totally agree with you on your second point about Stannis at the Wall being the highlight of Season 5. It was absolutely epic! And regarding the Starks, family definitely comes first for them. Ned refused to kneel to Joffrey until Varys convinced him it was for his family. It just goes to show how important family is in the world of Game of Thrones. But let me tell you, you need to be careful when using the Game of Thrones wiki. It's not official whatsoever and its summary of season 5, written before the season aired, is way off on some things. It referenced the crown's debt, the Riverlands, and Quentyn Martell, none of which were featured in season 5. So, always take what you read on the wiki with a grain of salt. I've always thought that George R.R. Martin's writing is hit or miss. His imagination more than makes up for it though. And that picture of Catelyn? I thought it was terrible too. She looks nothing like that, not even by the book description. She isn't a fighter, and she's not a Stark. But if it's Arya, then it makes total sense and is badass. As for the characters who died, I don't get the point of explaining why they died. Don't most show watchers know why? I say, screw "moral gray areas" and "breaking the tropes". I want to see some major characters die! When it comes to Tyrion being Azor Ahai, I doubt it. There's certainly evidence, but not enough or as much as there is for Jon or even Dany. He wasn't literally born from smoke and salt like Dany nor does he have the "song of ice and fire" like Jon (assuming R+L=J). He definitely has the best Nissa Nissa (remember that Jon didn't actually kill Ygritte), but no Lightbringer. However, if you buy into the "three heads of the dragon" theory, Tyrion is the best third head. It seems that each person doesn't have all the characteristics of Azor Ahai, but collectively they do. Tyrion has the Nissa Nissa, even if R+L=J is wrong Dany has the blood of the dragon and is born among salt and smoke, and Jon has the resurrection aspect plus Lightbringer (he's the only one with a sword, a sword that kills White Walkers no less). All of that, plus Dany's three dragons, provides heavy support for the three heads theory. I would pay so much to see a Game of Thrones movie. And let me tell you, Stannis is dead in the show. Why didn't they show his death then? I know we all like the "he's not dead until we see a body" rule, but I think it's clear enough this time. The "too gratuitous" thing I don't get though. We've seen Ned's head on a spike and we've seen Robb stabbed to death. But I think the director just left it out with Stannis in order to save time. The episode was already rushed as is. Yes, Stannis is alive in the books. Along with a hundred other different things that aren't in the show. The two stories have diverged a lot by now. You may say that this is too big of a plot moment to be split up, but The Winds of Winter hasn't been released yet. Is it too radical to think that maybe a similar thing happens in that book, just later? And when it comes to reviving Stannis, who do you think can revive him? He's surrounded by his enemies, Melisandre is at the Wall and to the best of my knowledge Thoros of Myr is still in the Riverlands. Also, let's consider how reviving him affects the plot. First of all, we're very likely already getting one revival this season, Jon Snow. It would be pretty lazy on the screenwriters' part to just bring back two major characters after they die. And we need to consider what would come next if Stannis was revived. He has no family, no army, and no advisors. He has nothing at all except the person who revives him (whoever that may be). He already had one major defeat that he came back from, doing it twice seems, again, lazy. I know we all like Stannis a lot. I know I did, he was my favorite character and the person I rooted most for. The concept of him dying seems far-off, but we have to remember what show we're watching. He bears an uncanny resemblance to Roose Bolton. Now, let's talk about the Iron Throne. Why is it outside of the Red Keep? And why is Winterfell right next to the Wall? And why are Jon Snow and a white walker fighting in Winterfell? I don't mean to overanalyze things, but I think this throne is telling us something different than the one that George R.R. Martin approved. Let's start with the similarities: it's dark, sharp, and unlike any other throne in fiction or in the real world. The picture of the throne according to GRRM shows how imposing the throne is and how intimidating it looks to those not on it. The throne in this post is very similar, but I think it's also showing how intimidating it is to those who are on it or want to be on it. As we know, the path to the throne is deadly indeed, and most people fail in their endeavors to reach it. And those who do reach it, reach it in the wake of (at least one, but usually many) death. If you see it like that, then it's not over-the-top at all. It perfectly demonstrates the long and deadly path to the throne and what awaits whoever makes it there: isolation, darkness, and fear. And don't even get me started on the direwolves. They're a creature of the North, plain and simple. But too many people try to connect every aspect of history to something in the story. GRRM uses snippets from history in his books, he's not writing an allegory. Lastly, I think a Lannister comeback would actually be really cool. That picture of Joffrey and Tommen combined? Genius! And the top part of Jaime's head is Renly while the bottom part is Robert. He needs longer hair and a bigger crown. The face is definitely Robert though, and to anyone who's not an obsessive viewer like me, they'll easily see Robert. Overall, Season 5 really wasn't that bad. The King's Landing story was great and well executed (and it came right from the books so you can't complain about that), Tyrion travelling to Meereen with Varys and then Jorah was fun and it was a lot less tedious compared to the books, watching Dany's success unravel, watching the greatest knight in Westeros fight and watching Drogon burn Harpies was entertaining, Stannis' storyline had me hyped all the way up to episode 10, and of course Hardhome. The only bad parts were Sansa in Winterfell (which had its moments too), Arya, and Dorne. And let's be real, even if every guest wore chainmail, which would make no sense, they'd still die because they don't have weapons. So, let's just enjoy the show for what it is and not overanalyze everything.
