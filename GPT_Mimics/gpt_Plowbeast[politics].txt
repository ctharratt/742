In today's world, the media industry is still very much for profit. The majority of the wealthy, as well as stockholders, do not see the media part of their portfolio as a loss leader but as simply another private company they demand to seek revenue at all costs. The more money your portfolio makes, the more one has to be a philanthropist, political donor, or nutjob. They do, and it's worth far more for your money to use a PAC than to somehow influence a news organization all the way down to subtly hope it will sway voter sentiment. Those news networks and newspapers have been spending the past decade trying every trick and chasing every ambulance from native advertising to on-air product placement. We have actual media firms that have owner capture which are visibly loss leaders and/or blatantly ideological. Except CNN, the networks, and affiliates are all making moves specifically for ratings and revenue. This battalion of reporters didn't chase after Hillary because their corporate overlords wanted a puff or slam piece, they did it because they needed a point bump that day. If your argument of partiality is a firm's moves in its self-interest, the corporate media has made moves for over a decade in that direction away from any one candidate or even ideology. The corporate media doesn't care. They can sell Hillary going to Chipotle, they can sell Sanders as an underdog story, they can sell Trump on pure outrage fuel, and so on. Besides FOX and MSNBC, the cable networks, broadcast networks, and even the affiliates are judged on whether they produce sufficient ratings for their content to justify ad rates - that's it. The executives, the wealthy board members, and especially the shareholders care far more about that than taking a hit to push their favorite candidate - that is literally why so many championed for PACs so they can separate business from politics to maximize their control in both separately. McCain as a surprise running mate would be very interesting if Sanders gets the nomination. It would torpedo whoever the Republican nominee is for good assuming the DNC doesn't freak out all the way to the White House. On the other hand, if both of them pass while in office, the successor would be Paul Ryan followed by Orrin Hatch. And instead of maximizing his unique value on these moments and minimizing it everywhere else, he decided to play the existing system instead of innovating and seeking out new coalitions of voters. It's more or less the same mistake John McCain made although Paul would have likely picked a far better running mate. What pharmaceutical company wouldn't love to be able to have the insane markup on a medicinal product with the scalable production costs of a medium-maintenance agricultural crop and minimal processing? It costs hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a blockbuster pill and at least double that to market it for a profit before the patent expires; the argument that these firms would have a business incentive to suppress weed is almost as bad as the argument that they would suppress a uniform one-shot cure for cancer. It gives advantages to the Republicans in the short term as it forces the opposition party away from being able to create compromise bills after bipartisan negotiation. There is a long-term bonus but bear in mind that the largest barriers are around amendment-tacking once a bill reaches the floor. The House has already added restrictions on doing this especially for appropriations bills which has limited pork barrel spending greatly. Unless the bill is written well, there's every chance this will be used as a cudgel to prevent large reform bills such as the ACA or pretty much anything by a Democratic President from properly reaching the floor. This bill will also not prevent legislators tacking on "poison pill" provisions that killed reform bills such as the bipartisan amnesty proposal a decade ago due to months of needless wrangling - you need legislators acting on good faith to really clear through the gunk here. There will be dozens and hundreds page long bills for the foreseeable future though due to the complex nature of the federal legal code no matter what this one bill says. The exact language will have to pass a lot of muster. There are also restrictions on adding amendments once a bill leaves committee which have prevented a great deal of pork barreling even though that was about 1% of the budget at its height. Not being able to create a compromise omnibus could have some huge implications even if it favors Republicans in the short-term. I believe Bloomberg is more left-leaning than Hillary too; he'd probably get a lot of votes just by saying Americans are too fat and like guns too much. He is very pro-law enforcement although has been surprisingly mute on the issue of financial regulation. There's not much you can offer someone who has 9 to 10 zeroes in their net worth; the same goes for the conspiracy theories that Hillary somehow bribed Trump to run. A President isn't who you go to for boosting your real estate holdings or TV show profile, and it's not like he would take a Cabinet position. The Kochs would never run, and they're not that well-liked even in monied circles. Bloomberg made some headlines protesting firearm proliferation, but that's also why he'd never win. Yeah, finance was already hugely complex and arcane before it unraveled into the public consciousness. That the principal actors barely understood their own models and risk should underline the truth of Hanlon's Razor; the coverups and "passing" of the toxic debt didn't take place until it was too late. Glass-Steagall's repeal and some other banks played a role in the speculation that turned a "routine" bust into a recession but by that same standard, we'd be lining up a lot of non-finance actors against the wall too, and that realization is necessary to prevent another collapse with precise legislation instead of more years raging at the faceless 1%. Did you read the article like at all or any source that wasn't biased against Soros/Koch brothers/Trump/RothschildCouncil/whoever? Peaceful demonstrators are not the same thing as opportunistic looters (many of whom showed up outside of the area) with many of the funded groups even defending businesses from attacks and demonstrating peacefully alongside law enforcement close by for weeks. What's more, the groups which Soros didn't even directly fund or at most received a quarterly update about, have long existed without being terrorists. It's almost like he's not funding terrorism in any shape or form even if you disagree with his politics. Civil rights or social justice are different animals than financial reform. In conclusion, the media industry is still very much for profit, and the majority of the wealthy, as well as stockholders, do not see the media part of their portfolio as a loss leader but as simply another private company they demand to seek revenue at all costs. The more money your portfolio makes, the more one has to be a philanthropist, political donor, or nutjob. They do, and it's worth far more for your money to use a PAC than to somehow influence a news organization all the way down to subtly hope it will sway voter sentiment.
