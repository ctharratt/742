Gundam games have come a long way since the days of Crossfire and prior releases. The latest release, Gundam Versus, is a testament to the evolution of the franchise. The game mechanics are perfect, and the combat is awesome. The meta never got the chance to grow to Gundam VS levels, but it had the fundamentals. The game is not about combo execution as much as maneuvering properly in a 3D space. Combat is more about gaining an advantage over your opponent by getting in a position where they can't attack. Sure, combos are mashy, but the game isn't about that at all. Constantly getting team assists and guarding are crucial, along with knowing your kit. The game is a spinoff of the main Gundam franchise, and it features a roster of over 90 mobile suits from various Gundam series. The game is a 2v2 or 3v3 team-based fighting game, where players can choose their mobile suits and fight against other players online. The game is fast-paced and requires quick reflexes and strategic thinking. The game's customization options are limited, with only a few cosmetic options available. The skill system they had for bonuses was tedious and artificial. The kits on each character were fine as is as far as combat's concerned. The game's advertising did a terrible job selling it. The characters/story was pretty cool, especially for a new IP, but most of the game pages focused on only a few character designs. In addition, the game itself didn't explain the story/lore at all, you had to read a comic to get that so that wasn't ideal. The game's free-to-play system was pro-consumer. Characters didn't cost too much, and you could absolutely enjoy the game without paying. Default outfits looked better than their DLC counterparts. I didn't like the skill system in general and certainly didn't see the need to put money into it. So I believe Rise of Incarnates failed because it wasn't making any money. And with the cost of the comic's production, could have actually been losing money. The game's poor marketing and free-to-play system were the main reasons for its failure. The game's alpha/beta stage lasted way too long, killing hype. The kicker was the free-to-play system. What's funny is it was pro-consumer. Characters didn't cost too much, and you could absolutely enjoy the game without paying. Default outfits looked better than their DLC counterparts. I didn't like the skill system in general and certainly didn't see the need to put money into it. Gundam Versus is a great game, and it's a shame that Rise of Incarnates failed.
