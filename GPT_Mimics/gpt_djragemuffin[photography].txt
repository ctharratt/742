I've been getting more and more into photography lately, and I'm starting to realize that my current equipment just isn't cutting it. I have a Canon Rebel xTi, which is a decent entry-level DSLR, but it's definitely showing its age. I've been doing some research and talking to other photographers, and I think it's time for me to upgrade my camera and lenses. First of all, I've been using a 50mm lens for portraits, but I'm looking to get a macro lens for food and nature photography. I also have a strange desire to take macro shots of everyday items, so I want a lens that can handle that as well. I've been considering renting lenses first to see which ones work best for me, and I've heard good things about the 70-200 lens. I also have a Yongnuo flash, and I'm planning on investing in another one with a transmitter built in so I can fire the one I already have. I'm really interested in Rembrandt lighting for portraits, so I'm excited to experiment with that. I also enjoy street photography and documentary-style photography, and I'd like to get into astrophotography as well. All of these styles would benefit from a camera with a higher ISO than my current one, which maxes out at 1600. I'm also interested in getting into portrait and wedding photography, so I know I'll need some new lenses as well. I really like prime lenses, so I'm trying to get to the point where I use my 50mm and whatever other prime lenses I can find. I've been considering the Rokinon brand, but I didn't realize they weren't specifically for Nikon cameras. I'll have to do some more research on that. I've been considering upgrading to a full-frame camera, but I'm not sure if it's worth the investment. I don't know much about mirrorless cameras, so I'm not sure if that's a better option for me. I'm currently running Windows 10, and I recently had a scare where I thought I lost all my photos due to a corrupted memory card. I've learned my lesson about saving over original files and making sure I have backups! I've also been wondering about the pros and cons of Canon vs Nikon cameras. I know both brands have their loyal followers, but I'm not sure which one would be better for me. I don't think I'm losing anything too important by sticking with a crop sensor, but I'm open to suggestions. As for photo processing software, I've been using Lightroom 5 but I'm not sure if I should upgrade to 6. I've also been considering other programs like GIMP, Paint.net, and Lightzone, but I'm not very familiar with them. I'm still very new to photography and I'm trying to learn as much as I can, so any suggestions or tutorials would be greatly appreciated. One thing I've been curious about is reverse mounting a lens to achieve a macro effect. I've seen some interesting photos using this technique, but I'm concerned about damaging the lens. I'll have to do some more research on that as well. Overall, I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a photographer. I know that upgrading my equipment will help me achieve my goals and improve my skills. I appreciate any advice or feedback from more experienced photographers, and I'm looking forward to seeing where this journey takes me.
