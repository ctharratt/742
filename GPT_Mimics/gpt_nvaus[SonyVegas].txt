Hey there! It's great to see you working with Vegas Pro. I've been using it for a while now and I've learned a lot of tips and tricks that I'd love to share with you. Let's dive in! First off, if you're having trouble with a plugin not applying or not working properly, try reinstalling Vegas Pro. It could be a simple fix and save you a lot of time troubleshooting. When working with multiple tracks, keep in mind that whatever is in the top track will cover what's beneath it for the duration of the clip. This can be useful for layering effects or text over your footage. If you're having trouble applying a plugin, try clicking the plugin icon on the clip instead of dragging it onto the clip. This will open a menu where you can choose from the available plugins. Note that some plugins may only work on the track highest in the timeline. When using the blur plugin, there are sliders to increase or decrease the blur effect. Masking is also very easy, especially for the sort of blurred edges you may be looking for. You can use the masking tool to mask out the center of the clip and feather the edges as desired. If you're looking for a way to create blurred edges without using the blur plugin, try copying the entire video track and pasting it into a new track higher in the timeline. Then apply blur to the new track and use the masking tool to mask out the center so the original footage shines through. Just make sure not to put a video clip in that part of the timeline or it will be black. When it comes to rendering your project, make sure to select the appropriate settings for your desired output. For example, if you're rendering for YouTube, select the Internet 1920x1080-30p preset under Sony AVC and customize the settings to your liking. Keep in mind that setting the bitrate too low will result in lower quality video. If you're experiencing slow render times, try disabling smart resample on the clip. This can help speed up the rendering process, especially for longer clips. When it comes to upgrading to a newer version of Vegas Pro, keep in mind that newer versions may offer better performance and features. For example, Vegas Pro 13 offers improved playback performance and independent volume meters on each audio track. If you're a hobbyist, Vegas Pro 11 may be a great option, but if editing is your job, you'll appreciate the performance increase in Vegas Pro 13. If you're having trouble with a clip not rendering or causing issues in your timeline, try opening a new Vegas Pro window and pasting all your clips into the timeline as they are in your current project. If it renders fine in the new project, it may be a glitch in the timeline itself. When it comes to stretching a clip, make sure to unlink the audio from the video before stretching the clip to leave the audio unaffected by the stretch. You can also shrink the image size in an external program before importing it onto your timeline to avoid stretching altogether. If you're looking to rotate a clip using keyframes, it's important to make sure you've made the correct selection. Double check your selection and try again. When it comes to uploading your video to YouTube, keep in mind that YouTube enables higher bit rates for 4k videos than for 1080p videos. If you render out and upload in 4k, even if the video was only recorded at 1080p, you'll avoid artifacting and have a higher quality video. If you're having trouble with a transition between clips, try double clicking on the edge of the clip again to go back to normal. If you're looking to change the pitch of your audio, use the change pitch audio plugin to make it go higher or lower. If you're having trouble with the crop box, try taking a screenshot of your window and sharing it with others for troubleshooting. And if you're having trouble with a corrupted clip, try converting it to a different format with a separate program to see if that solves the issue. Finally, if you're having trouble with your product license, it may be expired or installed on too many computers. Contact Sony for assistance or consider purchasing a new copy on eBay for a simpler solution. I hope these tips and tricks help you in your Vegas Pro journey. Happy editing!
