At least it didn't affect you in any way. I mean, sure, the ship was sunk on the 7th, but wouldn't it have been 9 days since then? IIRC, that Merlin engine transformed the P-51 into the dominant presence that it became. Naa, it's because the best plane engines were the Merlin or Sabre engine. :-P And let's not forget about Italy getting their asses handed to them in Africa, which delayed the invasion in the spring as originally planned. And then the Japanese decided to attack the US instead of helping pincer the Russians. There are countless mistakes made by Hitler and I'm grateful for every one of them. Or if their Jap allies had attacked the Soviet Union to the east instead of rushing to take over the Pacific, thus awakening the sleeping giant. Pre-edit edit: I'm only calling them Japs because I'm talking about those Dec 7, 1941 Japanese. I totally less than three our current allies from the land of the rising Sun. And so it begins. You know, that's pretty fucking wasteful when they could just drop one of the great whites that already has the tracking tag. I'm part of that crowd that will tip you more for a $20 meal with happy than $40 without happy. Why punish me if it's the restaurant's fault? I understand, but I end up with a waiter who no longer has my best experience in mind and pushes the more expensive meals and drinks instead of the tastiest. I can't stand places that don't list prices on their drink menu and waiters that only recommend the filet or the lobster, but now I see the motivation. tl;dr: I shouldn't be punished either. This man does not reflect what our people are actually like! Okay, he does, but some of us apologize ðŸŒ· Yes! I can remember thinking I could get around objects/people with the knight movement. I've also had this happen with countless video games, computer programming, and Stratego. Found the billboard salesman. I learned about the Han Dynasty from Destiny of an Emperor. One of my fav RPGs ever. Han Dynasty for 1,000 years! The Lord has killed many. Doth this make his wisdom any less true? Why does a brainless monkey need animal rights? Also, what about the chimp? Basically, you experienced Europe slightly better than a hobo. I'm down for traveling on the cheap, but restricting your experience down so much isn't worth it, IMHO. Organized religion is one step away from a cult. Well...she made a human and didn't take care of it herself, so I wouldn't say it's not her fault whatsoever. Oh, okay. So you experience the crash, but not the depression type after-effects? I've never done anything beyond weed, so it's all foreign to me. That's interesting. I've never heard anyone say that about coke. You may be in a minority who aren't really affected by the chemical crash. I was thinking acid, but I guess I prefer Dylan. I remember a cop in New Orleans asking me and my two black lady friends the color of 2 men that attacked them: Officer: "What color were they?" Friend: "Black" Officer: "how black?" Friend: "not brown, black. What do you mean?" Officer: "I mean, does the oil light come on every time they get out of the car?" Friend: mouth open, speechless Me: "Did you seriously just say that?" Officers: chuckling "heh...we had 9 murders last night, so this isn't really a priority." I fucking hate New Orleans. They'll find another place to make money, they always do. His comment was no such thing. He said that, in his experience, pre-med, law, or science student rejects ended up going into social work. You're being overly defensive because you are either A) one of those rejects or 2) just taking personal offense since you're in the field. In my experience (not a blanket either), people who go into psychology and social services have serious issues of their own that they can't resolve. I've always wondered if feeling like they're helping others makes them hope it will somehow help themselves. Kind Regards, Internet Expert. I've tried to kick time so often, but I just can't stop using. Get your stinking paws off of me, you DAMN DIRTY APE!!! This was my first thought as well, but your phrasing is better. Wait, is it vital or trivial? "This is the most important unimportant thing we can do!" -Author. I'm not watching this shit either, but I'm curious where it took place? That work is always processed under dual control (2 people present), so it's not easy to do. That being said, there are always shitty people, and they end up infesting every facet of our society. I can tell you that now that our ATMs count the cash right there in front of you and that work is processed in cash vaults as much as possible, where there are casino-level controls, so this situation should be extinct. There are still shitty people on Earth though, and they'll find other ways to take advantage. Edit: grammarz. Well, let me put it this way because it's the only thing I can say with certainty. 99% of the people at the 1st 3-4 levels of customer service have no malicious intent. If they screw up, it's because they lack training or common sense. Now as for the people who manage our products and influence the fee structure, a bunch of salesman. Literally, that's their background. I TRULY loathe that group, as I find myself battling with them more than others. Now, I understand that money needs to be made somewhere and that means fees, but I'm no expert there. I do believe though we are getting better, slowly, which is a good thing. It just takes some time when you're a massive company. Maybe I should go to a smaller bank and help them succeed so that a larger one will gobble them up :-/ - Anyway, sorry you had a shit experience, wish I could have helped. Edit: Grammaticals. Months? No. It could have been months before they read the statement, not really sure. There's something not right though. Not saying it's your fault, but I wish I could help you. We don't send anything that small to collections, so it was either a misunderstanding or you had an outstanding transaction post, and the tenants saw the OD Notice. What experience have you had that compares to Comcast? It's actually BAC, in an attempt to move away from that BofA crap. I can tell you that internally, there is no malicious intent. As the story says, it went to an outside attorney who is no longer in business. Lack of controls to ensure the issue was resolved to completion is the root of the problem. Like every business, we have a lot of not so smart people. I can tell you that SO much of our resources in the past 3 years have been allocated to correct issues that present risk to our company. I, and the other "smart" ones (we just use logic), spend most of the day on the phone helping, arguing with, and convincing the idiots what the right course of action to take. I, seriously, fight for the customer every single day I'm there because it's the right thing to do. Does your job not have idiots that you battle? They lost me about 5 years ago. I have Netflix & HuLu for 1/4 what I used to pay, and I'd gladly subscribe to some HBO GO. Ooga booga, where da white women at!? ftfy. I think the idea is that he potentially ruined or ended more lives by many magnitudes, even if it was somewhat indirect. And that's all I have to say about that.
