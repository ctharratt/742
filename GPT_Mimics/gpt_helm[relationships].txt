It's been 18 months since my daughter was born, and I'm starting to doubt my abilities as a father. I thought I had it all figured out, but it seems like every day brings a new challenge. My wife babies her more than I do, and I'm an aikidoka, so I have my own ways of dealing with her. But sometimes it feels like nothing works. One of the biggest challenges is dealing with her tantrums. When I restrain her, she cries as if I'm abusing her. It's exhausting, but I know that if we don't reward her tantrums, they will eventually stop. But what's even harder to handle is when she says, "No, not you daddy, I want mummy!" It's like a punch to the gut every time I hear those words. I know it's just a phase, but it's still difficult to deal with. And then there's the physical aspect of dealing with a toddler. My daughter has a way of fighting back that makes it hard to do anything without using borderline abusive amounts of strength. She'll hit us in the face or throw herself headfirst on stone tiles. It's a constant battle to keep her safe and under control. But despite all of these challenges, I still love being a father. It's the most rewarding thing I've ever done, even if it's also the most difficult. And I know that with time and patience, we'll get through this phase and come out stronger on the other side. One thing that's been on my mind lately is my crush on a coworker. It's something I've been trying to ignore, but it's getting harder and harder to do so. I know it's not fair to my wife, but I can't help the way I feel. I've never had a crush like this before, so I'm nervous about what might happen if I act on my feelings. I've been texting with my coworker a lot lately, but it's mostly just about work stuff. I want to flirt with him and see how he responds, but I'm afraid of making things awkward between us. I don't know if he feels the same way I do, and I don't want to risk our professional relationship. But at the same time, I can't help but wonder what might happen if I take a chance. Maybe he feels the same way I do, and we could have something special. Or maybe it would just be a mistake that I regret for the rest of my life. It's a difficult situation to be in, and I don't know what the right answer is. All I know is that I need to be careful and think things through before I make any decisions. Another challenge I've been facing lately is dealing with my daughter's behavior. She's been throwing tantrums more frequently, and it's been hard to know how to handle them. My wife and I have different approaches, and it's been causing some tension between us. I know that some people don't like infants and toddlers, but I love my daughter more than anything. It's just hard to know how to discipline her without resorting to physical force. I don't want to be the kind of parent who locks their child up or leaves them in the hall until the tantrum ends. But at the same time, I don't know what else to do. It's a constant struggle, but I know that we'll figure it out eventually. We just need to keep trying different approaches until we find something that works. One thing that's been helping me lately is my aikido practice. It's a martial art that emphasizes using your opponent's energy against them, rather than relying on brute force. It's been a great way to stay in shape and relieve stress, and it's also given me some new tools for dealing with my daughter's behavior. Overall, being a father has been the most challenging and rewarding thing I've ever done. It's not always easy, but it's always worth it. And I know that with time and patience, we'll get through this phase and come out stronger on the other side.
