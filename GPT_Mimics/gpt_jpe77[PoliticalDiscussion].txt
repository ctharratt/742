The topic at hand is the potential exclusion of Muslims from entering the United States. This is a highly controversial issue that has been brought up by various politicians, including Donald Trump. The idea of excluding an entire religious group from entering the country goes against the principles of religious freedom and tolerance that the United States was founded upon. First and foremost, it is important to understand that the power of the government over the border is plenary. This means that the government has the authority to control who enters and exits the country. However, this power is not absolute and is subject to constitutional limitations, including the establishment clause of the First Amendment. The establishment clause prohibits the government from establishing a national religion or promoting one religion over another. Excluding Muslims from entering the country based solely on their religion would be a clear violation of the establishment clause. It would be promoting one religion (Christianity) over another (Islam) and would be seen as the government endorsing a particular religion. Furthermore, the idea of excluding Muslims from entering the country is not only unconstitutional but also impractical. It is impossible to determine someone's religion simply by looking at them or their passport. It would be a violation of privacy to ask individuals to disclose their religious affiliation, and even if they did, it would be difficult to verify the accuracy of their response. Additionally, excluding Muslims from entering the country would not necessarily make the country safer. The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and law-abiding citizens who pose no threat to national security. It is important to focus on identifying and preventing individuals who pose a threat, regardless of their religion. It is also important to consider the potential consequences of excluding an entire religious group from entering the country. It would send a message of intolerance and discrimination, which goes against the values that the United States was founded upon. It would also damage relationships with Muslim-majority countries and could lead to increased hostility towards Americans traveling abroad. In conclusion, excluding Muslims from entering the country based solely on their religion is unconstitutional, impractical, and goes against the values of religious freedom and tolerance that the United States was founded upon. It is important to focus on identifying and preventing individuals who pose a threat, regardless of their religion, and to uphold the principles of the establishment clause.
