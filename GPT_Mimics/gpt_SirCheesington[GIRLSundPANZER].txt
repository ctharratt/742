Yo, what's up my dudes? It's your boy back at it again with some hot takes on the Girls Und Panzer subreddit. First off, let me just say that this isn't the place for your random posts. This is a place for us to talk about Girls Und Panzer, so let's keep it on topic, okay? Now, I know some of you are concerned about that account with the inappropriate content. Let me tell you, there's not much we can do about it unless we can contact the owner or get the site it's hosted on to take it down. So let's not waste our time worrying about it, okay? But seriously, how did you even get here? This subreddit is for true fans of Girls Und Panzer, not some random person stumbling upon it. And can we talk about that picture? It's nice overall, but those misshapen faces are really bothering me. They look like Nichijou face shapes with GuP eyes, and it's just not right. And let's talk about hentai for a second. I like my hentai with plenty of plot and development. Sure, "plot" is nice and all, but it gets boring after a while. And that Anchovy pr0n? No thanks, not my cup of tea. Now, I know some of you are eagerly awaiting the official sub release. But let's be real, it's going to be a while. Fansubs will start popping up a few weeks after its DVD release, so we're looking at around April or May for that. So just be patient, my dudes. And can we talk about that mildly NSFW picture? It's not really NSFW unless you consider the blush to imply something lewd. But let's be safe and give it a 10/10 Mildly NSFW tag. And how did you even get it to turn red? Now, let's talk about the cuteness of our favorite characters. As you can see, the one on the left is so much cuter than the one on the right. Look at those fabulous eyes, that more defined hair, that moe smile. This is the pinnacle of her beauty, my dudes. And can we talk about that sitting stretch? I googled it, and apparently it's just a pretty generic name. But all thoughts of lewdness have been dashed, thank goodness. Now, let's talk about those pictures of the girls in their natural habitats. It's a bit creepy, but whatever, the lace is nice I guess. But seriously, they need to learn how to hydrate. And what's up with Yukari wearing her boots with her bathing suit? That's just not right. And that picture of the witchcraft user? How the hell is she floating like that? And what exactly happens in those situations? I have so many questions. But let's end on a positive note. Yukari is hands down the best model, and that #5 picture of her is the most adorable one I've seen so far. Unfortunately, I have no idea what the letters say. But who cares, she's so freaking adorable. So there you have it, my dudes. My ramblings on all things Girls Und Panzer. Let's keep it on topic and keep the discussion going. And remember, always stay true to your waifu.
