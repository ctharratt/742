I have to admit, I'm not the biggest fan of awards shows. It's not that I don't appreciate the recognition and celebration of great work in various fields, but I often find myself questioning the criteria and validity of these awards. Are they truly honoring the best of the best, or are they just popularity contests? Take the Emmys, for example. Every year, we see the same shows and actors nominated, and while they may be deserving, it can feel like a bit of a revolving door. And then there are the snubs - the shows and performances that are overlooked year after year, despite critical acclaim and fan adoration. But perhaps what bothers me most about awards shows is the way they can overshadow the actual content being celebrated. Instead of focusing on the artistry and storytelling, we get caught up in who's wearing what, who's sitting next to whom, and who's going to win. It's like the actual work being honored becomes secondary to the spectacle of the event. That being said, there are certainly moments from awards shows that have stuck with me over the years. One that comes to mind is Viola Davis's acceptance speech at the 2015 Emmys, where she became the first Black woman to win Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Her powerful words about the lack of opportunities for Black women in Hollywood and the importance of representation still resonate with me today. But even with moments like that, I can't help but feel like awards shows are missing the mark. Instead of focusing on the same handful of shows and performers, why not use these platforms to highlight lesser-known but equally deserving work? And instead of turning the ceremony into a glitzy, self-congratulatory affair, why not use it as an opportunity to have meaningful conversations about the state of the industry and how we can make it more inclusive and equitable? Of course, I understand that awards shows are a business, and there's a certain level of spectacle and glamour that's expected. But I can't help but feel like we're missing out on something more meaningful in the process. All of this brings me to the recent controversy surrounding the Golden Globes. For those who may not be aware, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the organization that puts on the Golden Globes, has come under fire for its lack of diversity and questionable ethical practices. Earlier this year, it was revealed that the HFPA has no Black members, and that some members have engaged in unethical behavior, such as accepting gifts and other perks from studios and publicists. In response to this, many high-profile actors and industry figures have spoken out against the HFPA and called for change. Some have even pledged to boycott the Golden Globes until the organization makes significant reforms. While I applaud these efforts, I can't help but wonder if they're enough. Is it really enough to just boycott one awards show, or do we need to fundamentally rethink the way we approach awards and recognition in the entertainment industry? One potential solution that's been proposed is the creation of a new awards show that's more inclusive and transparent. This new show would be run by a diverse group of industry professionals and would prioritize recognizing work that's often overlooked by traditional awards shows. While this is certainly an intriguing idea, I worry that it could just end up being another popularity contest. After all, any awards show is only as good as the people who are voting on it. And if those people are still operating within the same flawed system, then what's the point? Ultimately, I think the key to fixing the problems with awards shows is to focus on the work itself. Instead of getting caught up in who's winning what, let's celebrate the stories and the people behind them. Let's use these platforms to have meaningful conversations about the state of the industry and how we can make it better. And let's make sure that the people who are voting on these awards are truly representative of the diverse voices and perspectives that make up our world. In the end, it's not about the awards themselves - it's about the art and the people who create it. And if we can keep that in mind, then maybe we can start to make some real progress.
