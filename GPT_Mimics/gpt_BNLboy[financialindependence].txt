I've been thinking a lot lately about the concept of retirement. It's something that seems so far off in the distance, yet it's something that we all need to plan for. I know some retired guys that worked at a bike shop part time. All they did was fix and tune up bikes for people. They would assemble some as they were delivered to the store. It didn't pay great but it gave them something to do and paid for their cycling hobby and coffee. It's a great example of how you can find something you love to do and make a little extra money on the side. But retirement isn't just about finding a hobby to keep you busy. It's also about making sure you have enough money to live on. And that's where things can get a little tricky. There are so many different retirement plans out there, and it can be hard to know which one is right for you. One thing that I've learned is that vesting is a big deal. I didn't really understand what it meant at first, but now I know that it's all about making sure you get to keep the money that your employer has contributed to your retirement plan. If you leave your job before you're fully vested, you might not get to keep all of that money. For example, I'm a public employee with a 10% contribution into my pension and a 14% match. If I leave before 5 years, I might not get to keep the full 14% match. That's a big deal! It's important to understand the vesting schedule for your retirement plan so that you can make informed decisions about your career. But retirement planning isn't just about your employer's retirement plan. It's also about your own personal savings. And that's where frugality comes in. I don't even know if the amount of money I've saved using a library over my lifetime is calculable. I've slowly been weening myself off of my book collection by selling back and donating. I'm currently reading Amazing Fantastic Incredible the stan lee graphic novel biography, inside cover says $30 retail. I'm enjoying this book, but I'd never touch it again if I owned it! “What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like they're trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?” ― Jerry Seinfeld Being frugal doesn't mean being cheap. It means being smart with your money. It means focusing on the things that are important to you and cutting back on the things that aren't. For example, when it comes to buying a car, I focus more on the dependability of the car than the gas mileage and style. Make sure the car does what you need it to do. If you have kids you may need a minivan, long distance commuters want small and efficient, service guys want vans, etc. You are the one that's going to be spending time in this car everyday. Above all just make sure you are happy with the purchase. Remember we're frugal, not cheap! I recently got a used car and purposely stayed away from things I have seen others lose money on. Sunroofs, keyless starts, GPS/computer screens are all things I have seen break in friends vehicles. They had to pay to have them replaced and they were not cheap. I avoided these things because I realized I don't need that luxury and don't want to chance them breaking in the 10 years I hope to have the car. But being frugal isn't just about saving money. It's also about making smart investments. And that's where things can get a little tricky. There are so many different investment options out there, and it can be hard to know which one is right for you. One thing that I've learned is that online investing accounts can be a great option. People are weary of financial planners because they shift money around for their own profit. Many aren't fiduciaries anymore which causes a lot of mistrust. My parents have lost money in the past 8 years with their financial planner but won't listen to my thoughts on them. You can always go for the military or fire fighter route. 20 years for a full pension! I am a state worker at a university and it's 32 years to a full pension. "Full pension" means 67% of your income at retirement based on your highest 3 years of earnings. We have a guy coming in now as a full timer that started as a student. He already has a year saved up and could retire at 50 easily. You have to put in 10% and they match 14% on top of that so the pension can really cover a good chunk of change when you're out and you still get health benefits when you retire. But no matter what investment option you choose, it's important to remember that retirement planning is a long-term game. It's not something that you can just set and forget. You need to be actively involved in your retirement planning, and that means staying up-to-date on the latest investment options and making adjustments as needed. And finally, it's important to remember that retirement planning isn't just about money. It's also about your mindset. You have to enjoy your work culture to stay in a job that long. A lot of city and state workers blow their money and have to stay decades to cover their bad spending habits. I know a few 7 digit club members in the 3 government jobs I've had so far though. If you play your cards right you will be just fine. I often remind myself that smoke inhalation is still the #1 cause of premature death worldwide. I have a gas stovetop and electric oven and have to worry about how much fat is in my diet because that's more likely to kill me in the US than cooking with wood. In the end, retirement planning is all about finding a balance. It's about saving enough money to live comfortably in your golden years, but it's also about enjoying your life now. It's about finding a job that you love and that pays well, but it's also about being frugal and making smart investments. It's about finding a balance between living for today and planning for tomorrow.
