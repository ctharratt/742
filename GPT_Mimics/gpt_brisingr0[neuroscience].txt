No thank you! Yeah, it's quite interesting. I am still waiting to hear back from EnChroma scientists to see if the lens is completely cutting out wavelengths or shifting a certain range of wavelengths up or down in length. I believe it is the former though. But I agree it really is striking how well it works. Despite the cones response being overlapped only taking out the peak response area results in such profound improvement. Very interesting experiment for color vision. I am running a survey in conjunction with this post, if you would like to participate click here. Oh have no fear, I share your anti-dualism views. I haven't written about philosophy in quite a while so any feedback on semantics and wording is helpful to me! Ah, I see your point. Thanks for the feedback. I never claimed dualism or the existence of a Cartesian theater. However, our consciousness (directly resulting from brain activity, obviously) is unable to access the processing of say V1. We do not have the ability to break the world down and see only lines. Therefore, color is a construct for our brain's conscious perception of the world. From what I can tell from Enchroma's website, the problematic wavelengths of light are completely filtered out rather than "re-mapped". Their notches are quite small and in the regions that caused poor color discrimination. No particular color would get worse because it was never there prior. I'm also not sure you can just claim "re-mapping' wavelengths would lead to a better product. "Re-mapping" 560 to 580nm would create artificially more red than there is in the world and that would not be realistic. Hahaha reactions are always priceless when they discover the mysteries of color. Fixed the discrepancies. Haha that's a few more years than I have! Ah sounds very interesting! I'm really interested in the rhythmic coordination between cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus; I've probably read some of your work! Best of luck with your research. Thanks again for all the help. Ah! Yes, that all clicks now! That really clears up my understanding up filtering. Brilliant idea about the ratios. Hmmmm I should make those buttons stand out more, also good feedback! Yeah working with logical arrays of spiking data is quite a bit easier than working with LFP data. Thanks for all your help, I'll keep you in mind if I get stuck or have new ideas! May I ask what you work on? I understand if you don't want that info on Reddit though. Thank you so much for your ideas and spending time on this, I really appreciate it. When there is no clear rationale, very fair point. I really did not have a rational. An even more accurate title would have been "What does stock data look like with a bandpass filter?" is an odd choice. Agreed, but as you saw simply stock price change runs into issues with stock splits. I could try to look for non-split adjusted stock data... a comparison with the brain's 1/f distribution no longer appropriate. Yeah, I guess I may need to try to hunt down non-adjusted data then. Detrending and z-scoring each segment between splits. That makes perfect sense I'll give it a go! Thanks for that. I think there might also be some confusion. There definitely is in regards to the stock data and picking the correct sampling rate. Your rat theta activity seems to be showing a modal frequency of about 10Hz or so. I wouldn't be too surprised at that, the data comes from a rat running on a track so I'd expect 8-10Hz to be dominant based on the literature. Don't try to downsample once the filter is designed. I could be wrong, but it is my understanding that the Matlab function I use, butter, designs the filter based around the sampling rate I input. From the documentation: If Wn is the two-element vector [w1 w2], where w1 < w2, then butter designs a bandpass or bandstop filter with lower cutoff frequency w1 and higher cutoff frequency w2. But, I've just begun to get into oscillation analysis (I'm mainly an action potential guy) so I could be wrong. Edit: formatting. I'm just curious, this is just a hobby and the overarching goal is to improve my programming knowledge. I guess we will see what the data says. Not sure if you're trolling... But if I can easily get bitcoin historic data I'll give it a go. If you have any good resources for that let me know. Yeah, I've given a bit of thought to different nodes. There are hundreds of possible variables to include for a stock so I'll need to think a lot about and test different variables at different weights. Basic things like revenue, profit, P/E ratios, earnings per share, debt, margins, the list goes on and on! I agree with you, IF I can think of the interesting and most relevant units to use. Thanks a lot for that first paper, I'm going to give that a close read. I was hoping to first go through and look to see how best to translate stock/market data into data that resembles brain activity. Then, use basic analysis to see if patterns emerge, for example granger causality (I know this is used often in econometrics), phase locking, coherence between stocks/indexes/commodities/twitter, lead-lag measures. And ultimately program a neural network that does not just rely on nodes but has physiologically similar dendrites and axons. Train it on historical data and feed into it real-time data to see if it can be predictive. So my thinking here is, LFPs indicate the underlying brain processing going on, with different frequencies and their prominence (relative power) being behaviorally dependent, theta for exploratory behavior, beta for associative processing. Now we have the stock market. Information comes in, investors and traders process it, and the stock/market reflects their processing. So, it may be, like during the financial crisis, the "processing state" of the market changed, and perhaps higher frequency oscillations emerge due to the panic. Since 2009, the market has been very stable, perhaps a different oscillation band is prominent. That was going to be the next thing I look at, doing an average PSD and PSD time series then power/frequency distribution. Hi r/Neuroscience. By day I am a PhD student looking into the neural mechanisms of self-control, but outside the lab, I am very fascinated with the stock market. I'm going to start attempting to apply neural analysis to stock and market data. This was my first step, and I would greatly appreciate any and all feedback, from analysis, to theory, to even grammar. This is on my personal blog, and it is in no way monetized. I avoided a text post because the figures are necessary for the piece. Yes, I do think for something as specific, and frankly difficult, as Statistical Computing an MS would serve you very well when looking for a job. Big data is huge now. For my technique, we are going from a few dozen electrodes in the brain 5 years ago to 512 and beyond now. That is a lot of data. The freedom with that degree is immense in terms of what field you can work in and your mobility to change fields.
