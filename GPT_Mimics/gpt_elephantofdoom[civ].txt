I have always been a huge fan of the Civilization series, and I have spent countless hours playing each iteration of the game. From the early days of Civ 3 to the latest release of Civ 6, I have enjoyed every moment of building my empire, exploring new lands, and engaging in epic battles with other civilizations. One of the things that I find most satisfying about the game is the sense of irony that often arises. For example, in Civ 5, there is a museum that is designed to demonstrate Chinese military strength, but it has to imitate an American ship. This is a perfect example of how the game can be both entertaining and educational at the same time. Another aspect of the game that I love is the way that different civilizations have unique abilities and strengths. For example, in Civ 3, the Privateers worked in a way that allowed for a production bonus if you had one major hub city and four trade routes. This was a godsend for me, as I often focused on building up my army and expanding my empire. Another civilization that I think is often overlooked is Germany. If you are planning to wait until the late game for victory, then Germany is a great pick. Their UA lets you maintain a massive military, and the Panzer's extra movement point is actually surprisingly good. I have found that expanding around a core and then settling the core like in later games is a great strategy for Germany. However, you need to be careful, as the AI can and will go through your territory, so don't wait too long to build up your military. Barbarians can be annoying, but unless you are in a multiplayer game, building your military will not be that much of a concern for the first 30-40 turns. The Keshiks could have won if they had taken advantage of their movement speed. They could have either flanked behind the camel archers and killed the damaged ones, or forced the camels to spread out to chase them, allowing the keshiks to pick off the smaller groups. But in a large group fight, they can't win. Plus, most of the fighting during these wars is not very interesting when we only check in every little while. The most critical part of wars like this when both sides have large armies is grinding units until one side collapses. Once one of the sides loses enough units, cities will fall very fast. This is sort of why Attila seemed to be able to hold out forever against the Sibir then lost all his cities in a couple of slides. One of the things that I find frustrating about the game is the way that the difficulty is often more about letting the AI cheat than anything else. This turns high difficulty into exploiting various quirks in the game until the way you play is completely different than on lower difficulties. However, this is just a minor annoyance, and overall, I still love the game. I also enjoy the way that the game allows for different playstyles. For example, if you want to rush Petra, you can, but you need to be prepared to rage-quit if you don't get it. I have found that switching back to Civ 3, which IMO has the best 'feel' to it, is a great way to get back in the mood and sick of the exploits. Then, I go back to Civ 5. Trading posts are really good late game when you need cash and your cities are already big, but early game you want more production and food. I always try to rush Petra, as it is one of the best wonders in the game. The only difference is how likely you are to rage-quit if you don't get it. I also love the way that the game allows for different victory conditions. The diplomatic victory is one of my favorites, but it can be difficult to achieve. The fact that you cannot get votes from reputation alone kind of ruins the diplomatic victory IMO. Basically, it means that diplomacy is useless, and the victory essentially turns into the economic victory, with whoever has the most gold getting the most city states. I have tried to get other civs to vote for me other than buying votes and liberating them, but they always seem to vote for themselves. One of the things that I find most interesting about the game is the way that it allows for different strategies and playstyles. For example, in Civ 3, global warming would turn grasslands into plains and plains into deserts. This added a whole new level of complexity to the game, and I would love to see something like this added to the newer versions of the game. Overall, I think that Civ 5 is one of the best strategy games ever made. It is actually one of the top games on Steam, and a lot of people still play it. If you only play single player, it will never be an issue. And don't worry, we are all established players, and you have been treated well. It will take a couple of games on a lower difficulty to get the mechanics, but it doesn't take long to play way on an average difficulty. In conclusion, I think that Civ 5 is a fantastic game that offers endless hours of entertainment. From the unique abilities of different civilizations to the different victory conditions, there is always something new to discover. Whether you are a seasoned player or a newcomer to the series, I highly recommend giving Civ 5 a try.
