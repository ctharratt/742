Hey guys, thanks for starting this thread. I just knew it, something big was going to happen and it did. I can't believe how incredible this whole thing has been so far. We need to post it soonish, we're halfway there and we need to keep the momentum going. I have to say, the difference between the media questions and the student questions is incredible. These students are amazing, they ask the real questions that matter. We need to work super hard to make sure Bernie becomes our president. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and we can't let it slip away. I mean, seriously, who do you guys think is winning the argument? Hillary or Bernie? I think it's pretty clear that Bernie is the one who can actually get things done. Republicans hate Hillary 10 times more than Bernie, they will block every step of hers, they've hated her throughout history. Chris is working for Clinton, trying to use her argument that "Bernie can't do it and she can". But we all know that's not true. And what about that "YUGE percentage of their income" comment? Haha, he still uses "yuge" everywhere. We need to get more people to watch this, tell your parents, your sisters, everyone! We need to spread the word and get more people on board. I love how these student questions are really making a difference. It's like what Star Citizen did, and it's the world's most successful crowd funded project. We need to keep the trends going, individual polls have margins of error, but Bernie has been trending up for months. We just need to keep pushing and we can win this thing. But I have to admit, I'm constantly worried in case there is a ceiling for Bernie. We should think about what chances we have that there is a ceiling. What percentage of Hillary's voters are extremely loyal? I guess we will see. But the fact that it's a dead heat shows that every day that passes Hillary is losing voters to Bernie, this has been true for months and months. I missed the Hillary part, did she do well or bad? Either way, it doesn't matter. Bernie killed it and we need to keep sending him our energy so his voice keeps going strong. And what's with this Cuomo guy? Haha, the Trump joke! He's a bit low energy today, not that it's a bad thing, but I like him when he's angry. You guys are hilarious, keep it up. Why does Hillary have to endorse a winner? Why can't our politicians endorse whoever they agree with the most? It's a messed up system, but we can change it. I plan to max out my contributions this month too! Thank you so much, don't listen to the brigaders. How many donations after the NH win? We should match or improve that. Also, how much money did he get after the NH win? Bernie is an awesome human being and we need to support him in any way we can. We are actually within the winning path by Nate Silver since we are tied nationally, and yes, this includes losing NV. We are within Nate Silver's path to winning, we just need to keep pushing and working hard. And what about that guy who asked about the transcripts? He was amazing, he destroyed her more than anybody I've seen. We need to follow him and make him famous. He deserves it. Overall, we just need to keep pushing and working hard. Every little bit helps, whether it's phonebanking, donating, or just spreading the word. We can win this thing, we just need to believe in ourselves and in Bernie.
