Oh, cats. They are such fascinating creatures, aren't they? I mean, they can be the bane of your existence one minute and the source of endless entertainment the next. Take plastic bags, for example. They are the ultimate temptation for cats. You can hide them away in a closet, but they will always find a way to get to them. And if you have a polydactyl kitty like mine, well, good luck keeping those bags out of their reach. That mutant paw of hers can reach places you wouldn't even think possible. But despite their mischievous ways, I can't help but love my cats. I still miss my old cat Butterbean so much, even though it's been almost four years since she passed away. Cats just have a way of worming their way into your heart and never letting go. And my current cats, well, they have me whipped. I can play with them for hours and just laugh and laugh. They are so smart and have such unique personalities. I'll continue being their slave forever, and I wouldn't have it any other way. One thing that always amazes me about cats is their ability to hoard things. My cats, for example, love to hoard milk rings. As soon as my boyfriend and I finish a gallon of milk and squish the jug, they both come running for the ring. And if we don't keep an eye on them, they'll stash them away under the couch. I swear, there are probably more than thirty milk rings under there now. It's both hilarious and slightly concerning. But it's not just milk rings that my cats hoard. They'll hoard anything they can get their paws on. I once found a string, a pad from a swimsuit, a little thing of lube I got from an AIDS fundraiser party, a milk ring, and my MAC makeup application pad all in one pile. It's like they have a sixth sense for finding random objects and claiming them as their own. Of course, cats aren't always a source of joy and laughter. Sometimes they can be downright frustrating. Take my cats' obsession with plastic bags, for example. It's cute when they play with them, but it's not so cute when they start chewing on them and potentially ingesting bits of plastic. And don't even get me started on the hairballs. Ugh. But despite their quirks and occasional annoyances, I wouldn't trade my cats for anything. They bring so much joy and love into my life, and I can't imagine not having them around. And I know I'm not alone in my love for cats. There are so many people out there who are just as obsessed with their feline friends as I am. In fact, there are entire stores dedicated to cats. Have you ever been to one of those pet stores that has cats up for adoption? I have, and let me tell you, it's both heartwarming and heartbreaking. On the one hand, it's wonderful to see these cats getting a second chance at a loving home. But on the other hand, it's so sad to think about all the cats out there who don't have a home and may never find one. I sometimes go to these stores just to pet and love on the cats because I know they won't get it anywhere else. It does make me depressed, but as someone who has volunteered at a humane society in the past, I know that these stores are often the last chance for a cat to get adopted. And I want them to feel like they got some love somewhere. Speaking of humane societies, I have to say, volunteering at one is not for the faint of heart. It's utterly soul-destroying, especially if you're a huge cat lover like me. Seeing all those cats in cages, knowing that they may never find a home, is just heartbreaking. But at the same time, it's also incredibly rewarding to know that you're making a difference in their lives, even if it's just for a little while. And let's not forget about the health issues that cats can face. Kidney failure, for example, is a common problem in cats. My old cat Butterbean died from it, and it was devastating. I remember wondering if there were any symptoms that I missed, anything I could have done to prevent it. One of the symptoms of kidney failure is crystal-like things in the urine, so if you notice that in your cat, it's definitely worth getting them checked out by a vet. Another common health issue in cats is the herpes virus. It's incredibly contagious and can cause all sorts of secondary symptoms, like conjunctivitis and nasal discharge. But the good news is that it can be treated with antibiotics and eyedrops. Lysine tablets and treats can also help reduce potential flare-ups. And let's not forget about the joys of fostering kittens. I've fostered about five or six litters in my time, and it's always an adventure. The last litter I fostered had eye infections, most likely a result of the herpes virus. But after six days of treatment with antibiotics and eyedrops, they were as healthy as can be. It's amazing to see how quickly they can bounce back from even the most severe illnesses. Of course, fostering kittens isn't always easy. I once fostered two completely feral kittens, and they got everywhere. I remember spending hours trying to find them, only to realize they had gotten stuck between my bathroom cabinet and the wall. But even with all the challenges, fostering kittens is one of the most rewarding things I've ever done. And if you're thinking about fostering kittens or cats, I highly recommend it. There are so many cats out there who need a loving home, even if it's just a temporary one. And who knows, you might just end up falling in love with one of them and giving them a forever home. In conclusion, cats are amazing creatures. They can be frustrating, hilarious, and heartwarming all at the same time. They have a way of worming their way into your heart and never letting go. And while they may have their quirks and health issues, they are worth every bit of love and attention we give them. So here's to all the cats out there, may they continue to bring joy and love into our lives for years to come.
