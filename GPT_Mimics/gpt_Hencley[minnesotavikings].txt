I'm pumped for next week's game. I hope the Vikings bring their A-game and show the frozen dump what they're made of. I mean, Joe Buck's dad was a big-time announcer and a die-hard Packer fan, so it's only natural that his son would follow in his footsteps. But let's not dwell on that. Let's focus on the game ahead. I used to be a Teddy "meh"-er, but I have to say, I'm really liking him tonight. And if anyone has anything negative to say about him, they can shut their whore mouth. I mean it. I'll even suck them off if they get this wrong. Blair, if you're reading this, send me a PM. You've got a sucking off coming your way. Now, let's talk about that controversial play. The difference between Palmer and Rodgers is that Palmer was actually facemasked, while Rodgers was only grazed by a thumb. If that had been Palmer, it would've been an immediate touchdown and discontinuation of the Cardinals drive. So yes, that play had much more weight in the outcome of the game. And let's not forget about that missed interception. I know you can't completely blame an injured Rhodes for missing it, but that might've been the ultimate decider of the game. I wanted that pick six so badly, but instead, we got a first down. Suck it, God. I don't understand why people believe that NFL players are robots who aren't affected by momentum. Momentum is a huge factor in any sport, and football is no exception. And why the hell can't we sack the QB? Come on, guys. Well, it was good while it lasted. GG. I noticed that Peterson has a tendency to cut when he could get more yards with his speed. He's doubting himself on some of those plays. And that throw was just terrible. I hate these posts that say "don't lose hope, we're rebuilding." Yes, losses like this are frustrating, but we can't just ignore the problems with the team. We need to figure out what's not working and fix it. And injuries don't excuse losses. It's part of the NFL, and we need to figure out how to deal with it. I hate to say it, but Teddy doesn't look like a franchise QB. We can't sacrifice that much time to develop a QB anymore. If he doesn't develop in three years, he's gone. And let's not use the excuse of a terrible offensive line. Yes, it's bad, but that doesn't excuse everything. You're in the NFL now, and you either be the best of the best or you'll be replaced. And can we talk about how the Packers fans are always giving us shit? I live near Green Bay, and I've been given more crap from Packer fans than I could ever explain. So when I see Viking fans, I like to poke fun at the Packers because I rarely get that comfort living here. It's nice to "virtually" talk some trash with other Viking fans. Overall, the team needs work. The offensive line needs major improvement, and we can't waste Adrian Peterson's precious years. Let's hope the Vikings can figure out what's not working and fix it before it's too late. SKOL.
