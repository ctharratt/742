It was a game that had all the makings of a classic. Two teams with a rich history and a fierce rivalry, battling it out on the pitch for bragging rights and crucial points. But unfortunately, the match between Liverpool and Manchester United failed to live up to expectations. United, who have struggled to create chances all season, were once again toothless in attack. Mata was the only player who looked capable of unlocking the Liverpool defense, but even he was unable to find a way through. Rooney and Depay were both poor, and the service into Benteke was woeful. Liverpool, on the other hand, had their fair share of chances. Coutinho and Benteke both had opportunities to score, but they were unable to convert. The Reds were also denied an early goal when Ramsey's effort was incorrectly ruled out for offside. The first half was a scrappy affair, with both teams struggling to find their rhythm. Arsenal's defensive errors gave Liverpool a number of chances, but they were unable to take advantage. Chambers was particularly poor, and it was a surprise to see him start ahead of the more experienced Mertesacker. The second half was a different story, with Arsenal dominating possession and creating a number of chances. The passing and movement improved, but they were unable to find the back of the net. Liverpool's chances were limited to counter attacks, and they were unable to create any clear-cut opportunities. In the end, a draw was a fair result. Both teams had their chances, but neither was able to take advantage. Petr Cech was the standout performer for Arsenal, making a number of crucial saves to keep his team in the game. Moving on to other matches, Dortmund have looked brilliant early on this season. They had numerous chances to score early on in their match against Ingolstadt, but they were unable to convert. Ingolstadt's first good spell was early on in the second half, but this was squandered after a lovely Ginter goal and a Marco Reus penalty. Douglas Costa was the standout performer for Bayern Munich in their match against Hoffenheim. Muller and Lewandowski both had chances to score, but it was Costa who stole the show. Hoffenheim will be disappointed to concede so late with a man advantage. In the Champions League, there are a number of intriguing groups to keep an eye on. Group A looks like a two-horse race between Real Madrid and PSG, with Malmo likely to finish last. However, they could be a dark horse and snag the Europa League spot from Shakhtar. Group B is a difficult one to call, with any of the four teams capable of advancing. However, I expect United and Wolfsburg to go through, with PSV getting the final Europa League spot. Group C is another tough one, with Benfica and Atletico Madrid the favorites. However, the newcomers Astana will likely steal some points at home, but won't replicate that form away. Galatasary will come third, with Atleti and Benfica advancing in that order. Group D is possibly the toughest group, with Juventus and Manchester City both expected to advance. However, I think Sevilla will sneak into the last 16, leaving City in the Europa League. Juve should win the group. Group E is a straightforward one, with Barcelona expected to top the group. Bayer Leverkusen won't get the better of Roma twice and will fall to the Italian side. I don't think Bate will put in a great showing. Group F is another interesting one, with Bayern Munich expected to advance. I am really keen on Olympiakos, and I think they can beat Arsenal to second place. Zagreb shouldn't expect much. Group G is a tough one to call, with Chelsea and Porto both expected to advance. Dynamo Kiev and Maccabi Tel-Aviv will be difficult trips away from home, however. Group H is another interesting one, with Valencia and Lyon the favorites. Gent will hold their own in what will be a tight group, but they won't see more European football after the groups. Moving on to the Portuguese national team, I've held great hope that Ronaldo's supporting cast can give him enough help to make a deep run in a major tournament. Unfortunately, with the exception of 2012, the Portuguese NT has been quite poor in this decade. The good news is the next crop of youngsters have great potential, which was on display at the U21 Euros. Bernardo Silva, William Carvalho, Paulo Oliveira, Joao Mario, Rafa, and Ruben Neves all look set to be regulars in the Portugal XI in the next few years. One major issue still lies up top, where Portugal have yet to develop a top striker since the days of Pauleta. Fernando Santos has called on Ronaldo to fill that void, and he has done well so far. However, as Ronaldo grows older, that hole will once again open. Fortunately, Portugal seem to have another Golden Generation of great talent. Combined with Ronaldo, they can yield great results over the next four years. I think Portugal will make a semifinal run in the Euros in France and a World Cup quarterfinal run in Russia. In terms of the Premier League, United's defense is solid, but the attack is toothless. Mata was the only creator against Swansea, and both Rooney and Depay were poor. The service into Benteke was poor, partially due to the Stoke defense, who were brilliant. Muniesa, in particular, was outstanding. All in all, it was a disappointing weekend of football. There were a few standout performances, but for the most part, the matches failed to live up to expectations. Hopefully, we'll see some more exciting football in the weeks to come.
