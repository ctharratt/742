As the presidential race heats up, it's becoming increasingly clear that the Republican Party is in disarray. With Donald Trump leading the pack, many are wondering how the party will recover from this debacle. Some are even speculating that Trump's candidacy is part of a larger conspiracy to ensure a Democratic victory in November. While this may seem far-fetched, it's not entirely implausible. First, let's take a look at Trump's candidacy itself. Despite his many controversial statements and lack of political experience, Trump has managed to maintain a significant lead in the Republican primaries. This is largely due to his charisma and ability to tap into the fears and hopes of his supporters. Many of these supporters are working-class Americans who feel that the system has failed them. They see Trump as a way to stick it to the establishment and shake things up. However, Trump's support is not limited to working-class Americans. There are also many intelligent people who are voting for him. This is partly due to his charisma, but it's also because he's far more intelligent than the other Republican candidates combined. Trump knows how to play the media and he knows how to get attention. He's a master at self-promotion and he's not afraid to speak his mind. Despite his intelligence, Trump is deeply unfavorable. This is partly due to his controversial statements, but it's also because he's seen as a loose cannon who can't be trusted. The Democrats will undoubtedly use this to their advantage in the general election. They will launch a barrage of attack ads questioning his business leadership and invoking fear to motivate their traditional voting blocs to come out and block Trump. Given all the media attention in the race thus far, I predict a really high turnout in the general election. Trump's supporters are the most dedicated and the most motivated of any Republican candidate I've seen by far. However, the demographic map favors the Democrats heavily. No blue state is going to turn red, and Trump is going to need to win all the swing states to win. I'd give the edge to Hillary in the electoral map. So, is Trump's candidacy part of a larger conspiracy to ensure a Democratic victory in November? It's certainly possible. Trump has only triumphed in GOP primaries so far. In the general election, he's going to get many more different types of voters and most of them are not going to buy his message. They are too educated and smart for his shtick. Furthermore, Trump has given Hillary all the ammo she needs to discredit him in general. The Republicans haven't attacked Trump in a sustained way beyond "we're not racist and he doesn't represent us". I think Trump's support is understated because no one wants to be seen as a racist or a bigot by supporting Trump. So they keep it to themselves or pretend to support another candidate. But at the ballot box, they vote Trump. If the conspiracy is true, I'd expect Hillary to hit hard with attack ads while Trump holds back for the most part. Trump may seem off the cuff and undisciplined, but he's not dumb. He'll know to keep his mouth shut when he needs to. Once Clinton is president, I'd expect she'll give him or his kids a little something as a reward (as a way to bridge the divide after a bitter election, blah, blah, blah...) You know, it's not totally implausible. Clinton and Trump could have easily met one on one to discuss this possibility privately at one time. Trump runs for the GOP and weakens the party inside out, but to keep their conspiracy hidden, Clinton lets Trump handle all the details once she encourages him to run. And they keep this between only themselves and their closest aides. Of course, if they had a deal to do this, I don't think Trump realized how far he would eventually be able to go. At some point, gaining the presidency for oneself increasingly sounds too attractive just to give it away to a friend. Hillary's going to need to poke holes in his business record and invoke fear to motivate the traditional Democratic voting blocs to come out and block Trump. There are signs that the economy is slowing down, so any acceleration in that slowdown will help Trump. Or, if there's another Islamist-inspired shooting like the one in California. Hillary herself has a lot of liabilities though. A lot of voters view her as an untrustworthy corporate shill and some Democrats could stay home because Bernie wasn't nominated. Hillary needs to play the evil fascist label against Trump hard to win. In conclusion, while it's not entirely clear whether Trump's candidacy is part of a larger conspiracy, it's certainly possible. Trump's support is understated because no one wants to be seen as a racist or a bigot by supporting him. However, at the ballot box, they vote Trump. The Democrats will undoubtedly use Trump's controversial statements and unfavorable image to their advantage in the general election. While Trump's supporters are the most dedicated and the most motivated of any Republican candidate, the demographic map favors the Democrats heavily. No blue state is going to turn red, and Trump is going to need to win all the swing states to win. I'd give the edge to Hillary in the electoral map.
