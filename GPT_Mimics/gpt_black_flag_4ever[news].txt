Finally, some real news. I stumbled upon an article about a worldwide, male-only society that wears dark-green robes emblazoned with a large cross and the motto “Deum Diligite Animalia Diligentes,” which means “Honoring God by honoring His creatures,” according to the group’s website. At first glance, it seems like a noble cause, but upon further investigation, it turns out that they honor animals by hunting them down. How does that make any sense? I hope they don't honor me next. It's not just this society that has me scratching my head. I recently came across a Craigslist ad for a roommate that read, "What could go right?" That's not exactly the most reassuring statement when you're looking for someone to share your living space with. And then there's the fact that they want to be Ben Affleck in MallRats. I'm not sure what that means, but it doesn't sound like a good sign. But let's move on to more pressing matters. President Barack Obama is expected to make a last push to close the questionable US jail at Guantanamo Bay, fulfilling an unfulfilled campaign promise. This is a legitimate issue, especially after seeing the conditions that prisoners are subjected to at the facility. And to top it off, they have college that's nearly free. It's about time we start prioritizing education and making it accessible to everyone. Speaking of accessibility, I also need Morgan Freeman text to speech. I'm not sure why, but it seems like a cool thing to have. On a more serious note, I've been doing some research on serial killers and it's alarming to see how many of them create a family image and work hard at looking normal. It's a reminder to always be vigilant and aware of our surroundings, especially when our little ones are involved in activities. But let's not dwell on the negative. We should focus on making positive changes, like making people vote by putting a sticker on a politician and then counting the stickers. It may not be a foolproof system, but it would certainly be entertaining. And speaking of entertainment, I just got a BluRay and now it's going to be this shit. I'm not sure what that means, but I'm assuming it's not a good thing. Moving on, bullying is a serious issue that we need to address, but it's disheartening to see teachers joking about it. How can we expect our children to take it seriously when the adults in charge are making light of it? It's time to take a stand and make it clear that bullying will not be tolerated from anyone. And while we're on the topic of standing up for what's right, let's talk about the recent news of a man who cut off his own feet and bled to death. How many people commit suicide in such a gruesome manner? It's a reminder that mental health is just as important as physical health, and we need to do more to support those who are struggling. On a lighter note, I'm an expert at moving with little to no money. I've done it three times and each time, I had to sell everything I had of value and bust my ass, but it's doable. Of course, I'm not suggesting that everyone should do that, but it's a reminder that we can make it work if we're determined enough. Speaking of determination, there's a person who is so concerned about their living situation that they've been there for four years, despite the fact that they could go live with relatives. It's a tough decision to sell a house, but sometimes we have to make hard choices. And while we're on the topic of hard choices, let's talk about the recent election. He drinks Brawndo, so I'm voting for him. I try not to assume the worst, but it's hard not to judge someone based on their actions. But let's not get too caught up in politics. I recently came across an article about a device that lets people control wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs with their brain. It's not "mind control," as some have dubbed it, but it's still an incredible advancement in technology. It's a reminder that we should always be pushing the boundaries of what's possible. And speaking of pushing boundaries, let's talk about the recent news of a baby saying the word "Dead" at a crematorium. It's creepy as hell, but it's also a reminder that we should cherish every moment we have with our loved ones. But let's not end on a somber note. I recently discovered that my state has Whataburger, so there's no need for Wendy's. And on a more lighthearted note, there's an article that asks if you can spot the difference between an animal and a churro. It's a reminder that sometimes, we need to take a step back and appreciate the absurdity of life. In conclusion, there's a lot going on in the world right now, both good and bad. It's important to stay informed and engaged, but it's also important to take a step back and appreciate the little things in life. Whether it's a good meal or a funny article, we should always make time for the things that bring us joy.
