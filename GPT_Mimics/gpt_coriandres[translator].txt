Yeah, so I was looking at this lock and it's written in simplified Chinese, pronounced yang ban. I tried searching it up in the dictionary, but no luck. The characters say 한국 (Korea) but they're really distorted, so I'm guessing it's the name of the company which made the lock - 한국콘솔 (Korea Console). The middle character looks like a logo. The last two characters say 콘솔 in Korean, which means 'console'. TIL you need to put a space before writing a question mark.  I also found some French text on a map. It says things like "Map # (left, right)", "Name of area, scale (left, right)", and "Map legend for convenience". There's also something about a "scale bar" and "nearby pages". I'm still learning Japanese, so it'd be nice if others could correct my translations if there are any errors.  Then there's this review for a hair product. Apparently, it's more effective than other down perm products. I have no idea what that means, but some people wrote that it raises your hair or something. I don't understand them because my hair is thick and sticks down pretty well without any gel or anything. If I use it once more, I'll be finishing the bottle and ordering more soon.  There's also a love note with nice handwriting. The second image says "there is only one truth". I'm not sure what that means, but someone explained it to me.  I'm learning Japanese in Korean, and I've noticed that neither language lines up very well with English. The text on this image is asking you to check your SEGA ID password again. It's a mixture of modified and traditional Kanji, and as far as I can see, they hold no meaning.  Then there's this score that I can barely make out. It says something about "quantification type I" and "dummy variables". I'm running low on time, so I can't translate the rest right now.  I also saw a comic with a message below it. I made some changes to the translation, so hopefully it helps.  There's also some game jargon that I don't understand. It's about a black core that only Steville has and a transparent lid that's been swapped.  I found something about a Chinese painter and calligrapher named Tianjin. His works are really impressive.  I also saw something on a North Korean news website. It's weird because as I was talking, I started to miss someone even more.  Overall, there's a lot of different things going on in these images and texts. It's interesting to see how different languages and cultures can come together in one place.
