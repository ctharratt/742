It's frustrating when the tl;dr (too long; didn't read) is vague and useless. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack, except the needle is the important information and the haystack is a jumbled mess of words. It's even worse when you take the time to read through the entire post, only to find that the tl;dr was a complete waste of time. But let's talk about something else that's disturbing - the sound of cows being slaughtered. Have you ever heard it? It's not something you can easily forget. The sound of their screams and the sight of their blood is enough to make anyone feel sick to their stomach. It's a reminder of the harsh reality of the meat industry and the price we pay for our carnivorous habits. Speaking of harsh realities, let's talk about fuck ups. We've all had them - those moments where we wish we could turn back time and do things differently. Maybe it was a mistake at work that cost you your job, or a drunken night that ended in a regrettable hookup. Whatever it was, it's important to remember that we're all human and we all make mistakes. But sometimes, it's not a mistake that we make. Sometimes, it's a freak accident that we couldn't have predicted or prevented. And in those moments, all we can do is react and hope for the best. Like when you accidentally drop your phone and watch in horror as the screen shatters into a million pieces. Or when you slip on a wet floor and land on your back, gasping for air. In those moments, it's natural to curse and swear. "Fuck me," you might say, as you try to process what just happened. But let's be real - "fuck me" is not the first choice of words in that situation. It's more likely to be a string of expletives that would make a sailor blush. And speaking of things that make us blush, let's talk about penis size. Specifically, the size of your neighbor's penis. Wait, what? How did we get here? Let me explain. You see, I have this neighbor who is always bragging about his sexual conquests. He's like a walking, talking version of r/ihavesex. And one day, he made a comment about the size of his penis that left me feeling a little... inadequate. I mean, I know that size isn't everything. But when your neighbor is going on and on about how he's hung like a horse, it's hard not to feel a little self-conscious. And then there's the fact that his mom is always hanging around, making things even more awkward. Speaking of moms, let's talk about mine. Or rather, let's talk about how she's cut ties with my brother after years of accumulated shit. It's a sad situation, but sometimes it's necessary to distance yourself from toxic people, even if they're family. And while we're on the topic of family drama, let me tell you about my uncle. He recently texted my mom and grandma to let them know that he was getting married, but only having a "small thing" with his girlfriend's family. I'm not sure what he meant by that, but it doesn't sound good. In fact, it sounds like the kind of thing that would make you want to puke. And speaking of puking, let's talk about Fuckcloud. Who or what is Fuckcloud, you ask? Well, according to some people, it's the mind. Others might say it's a state of being. Personally, I think it's just a bunch of nonsense. But speaking of nonsense, let's talk about drugs. Specifically, acid. I've never tried it myself, but I've heard some pretty wild stories. Like the time my friend took acid and thought he was a piece of toast. Or the time my cousin took acid and ended up naked in a field, covered in mud. It's not something I'm particularly interested in trying, but to each their own. And speaking of things that are each their own, let's talk about license photos. Have you ever taken a really bad one? Like the kind where you look like a serial killer or a potato with eyes? I recently had to renew my license and let me tell you, the photo is not flattering. But at least I'm not the guy who's never had a girl make a move on him. Seriously, dude, get it together. And speaking of getting it together, let's talk about drugs again. Specifically, getting high. I never planned on doing it, but once I did, I have to admit, it was kind of fun. Would I do it again? Maybe. But only if I had a really good reason. And speaking of really good reasons, let's talk about cheating. Specifically, whether or not the wife in a certain story was actually cheating. It's hard to say for sure, since the OP hasn't given us much to go on. But if she was, that's a pretty big fuck up. And speaking of fuck ups, let's talk about clogged toilets. Specifically, how to fix them. I've heard some pretty creative solutions, like stretching plastic bags over the bowl and flushing. It might sound crazy, but apparently it works. And speaking of crazy, let's talk about dogs. Specifically, my dog. He's a good boy, but he hates getting his nails clipped. Like, really hates it. He'll bare his teeth and growl and try to bite anyone who comes near him with clippers. It's a problem, because his nails get really long and it's not good for his health. We've tried everything - treats, distractions, even sedation - but nothing seems to work. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. And speaking of suggestions, let me suggest that we all take a deep breath and remember that life is full of ups and downs. We'll have good days and bad days, fuck ups and freak accidents, moments of joy and moments of despair. But through it all, we'll keep going, because that's what humans do. We persevere. We adapt. We survive.
