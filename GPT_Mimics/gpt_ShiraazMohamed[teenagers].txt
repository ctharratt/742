Hey guys. I just wanted to talk about some things that have been on my mind lately. First off, let's talk about politics. My parents voted for Billy Clinton both times, but I'm not completely sold on him. I mean, of course my own interests and well-being come before anyone else's. Shouldn't it be that way for everyone? But let's have a civilized discussion about it. I'm open to hearing other viewpoints. Speaking of viewpoints, let's talk about race and religion. As a Muslim who was once considering becoming an atheist, I have a unique perspective on this. My parents are totally different - my dad is a racist who hates blacks and gays, while my mom is not religious and supports LGBT rights. So what's a guy to do? I see three options: get a job and move out, tell my mom how I really feel, or just keep quiet and pretend everything is fine. Personally, I was about to tell my mom that I was an atheist, but then I decided to stay Muslim. It's a tough decision, but I think it's the right one for me. Now, let's talk about some more controversial topics. I know some of you might not agree with me, but hear me out. First off, let's talk about gun control. Imagine if the shooter at Sandy Hook had an assault rifle with extended magazines. It's a scary thought, but it's a reality we need to face. And speaking of scary thoughts, have you ever seen those extreme videos about animal rights? My ERWC teacher showed us some of those videos, and let me tell you, they were brutal. But sometimes you need to see the truth in order to make a change. And let's not forget about drugs and alcohol. I know some people are against legal weed, but really, if you're not stupid about it, you won't get caught. And if you want to drink, just make your own moonshine. It's not that hard. But of course, alcohol is haram, so maybe stick to wine if you can. And if all else fails, just spend $10 on a dose of heroin. Go big or go home, right? Now, let's talk about some political candidates. I consider myself a realist, and I know that there are only a few candidates with a shot to win. Cruz, Rubio, Trump, Clinton, and Sanders. Personally, I think Trump is out of the equation, and Sanders goes against my interests. Cruz is way too far right, and Rubio wants to close all sanctuary cities, which I think is wrong. Clinton wants a path to citizenship for all immigrants, which I support, but I disagree with her on capital punishment, homosexuality, and abortion. But let's not get too bogged down in politics. Let's talk about something fun, like video games. Why spend $400 on a console when almost any computer can handle those games? And let's not forget about the joys of masturbation. I thought it was spelled "masterbation", but apparently I was wrong. And as for kissing after oral sex, well, that's just a matter of preference, isn't it? I know some of you might not agree with everything I've said, but that's okay. We can still have a civilized discussion about it. And if you want to talk more about any of these topics, just message me. I'm always up for a good debate.
