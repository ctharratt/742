The topic of taxation has been a hotly debated issue for decades, and it seems that every election cycle brings new proposals and ideas for how to tax the wealthy. As a Sanders supporter, I believe that the wealthy should be taxed at a higher rate than they currently are. However, I also believe that there should be an incentive for people to make more money. One of the arguments against higher taxes for the wealthy is that it will cause them to move to other countries where taxes are lower. While this may be true for some people, I believe that the majority of wealthy individuals will choose to stay in the United States. There are many reasons for this, including family, friends, business connections, and language. It is difficult to pick up and move to another country, especially if you have a family and a business to run. Another argument against higher taxes for the wealthy is that it will discourage people from making more money. This is a valid concern, as people are naturally motivated by financial incentives. However, I believe that there should be a balance between incentivizing people to make more money and ensuring that the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. One proposal that I support is a top tier tax rate of 80-90% for people making over $1 million per year. This would ensure that the wealthy are paying their fair share of taxes, while still providing an incentive for people to make more money. It is important to note that this proposal would not apply to everyone, only to those who are making over $1 million per year. Another proposal that I support is paying athletes over 30 years instead of 2-5. This would help to prevent athletes from going bankrupt a few years after they retire. A 4 million dollar 4 year deal is only $133k/year over 30 years, which is a much more sustainable income for retired athletes. I also believe that artists should be paid more for their work. Many artists struggle to make a living, and it is important to support the arts in our society. While it may not be possible for every artist to become rich, they should at least be able to make a decent living from their work. In addition to these proposals, I believe that we need to address the issue of gun violence in our country. Every year, there are a massive amount of gun deaths in the United States. While some people argue that this is a mental health issue, I believe that it is also a gun control issue. We need to have common sense gun laws that protect the rights of responsible gun owners while also keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. Finally, I want to address the issue of blackmail. If you show that you are willing to be blackmailed about something, the person who is blackmailing you will keep doing it forever. It is important to stand up for yourself and not let anyone use your secrets against you. In conclusion, there are many proposals and ideas for how to tax the wealthy and address other issues in our society. While there may not be a perfect solution, it is important to find a balance between incentivizing people to make more money and ensuring that the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. We also need to address issues like gun violence and blackmail, and stand up for ourselves and our values.
