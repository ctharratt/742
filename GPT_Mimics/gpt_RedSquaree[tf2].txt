Ah, the world of TF2. A game that has been around for over a decade and still manages to captivate players with its unique blend of class-based gameplay and quirky humor. But with any game that has been around for so long, there are bound to be some intricacies and nuances that only the most dedicated players will understand. And that's where I come in. Let's start with the Spy. Ah, the Spy. The class that can turn invisible, disguise as the enemy team, and backstab unsuspecting foes. It's a class that requires a certain level of finesse and strategy to play effectively. And yet, there are still so many Spies out there who don't use their brains. They'll go for the far less reliable stab when they could just gun down the Heavy who has no ammo. It's aggravating, to say the least. But it's not just the Spies who can be frustrating. In lobbies and pubs, there are too many players who don't use their brains. They'll make silly mistakes, like walking 10ft hoping the enemy team won't turn around, instead of taking the safer route. It's like they're not even thinking about the game, they're just mindlessly running around trying to get kills. And then there's the competitive scene. In Highlander and 6s in both NA and EU, there are groups of players who are particularly familiar with one another and treat others within those groups differently to other people. It's a status thing. Some people have let it go to their heads and with others, you wouldn't even know aside from their high skill they were in such a group. It's like they're playing a different game altogether. But let's talk about something more positive. Matchmaking. Finally, after years of waiting, Valve has implemented a matchmaking system for TF2. And while the initial footage may not have been the most exciting, it's a step in the right direction. When there are thousands of people playing and ranks are established, the fun will begin. It's a competitive team game, after all. If you're not on a team, you should join one. You'll improve at a more rapid rate! Speaking of competitive play, let's talk about the different Medi Guns. The Quick-Fix, Kritzkrieg, and Vaccinator all have their strengths and weaknesses. The Quick-Fix allows you to be more aggressive all the time, while the Kritzkrieg makes the class you're healing very, very deadly. The Vaccinator allows you to negate certain types of damage, but it's also the least used gun in competitive. It's all about how well your medic's understanding of the Medi Guns is. Lower level medics play around charges, which loses games against medics who really know how to operate the Quick-Fix. But let's not forget about the other classes. The Heavy, for example, is a powerhouse of a class. But when he has no ammo, his tunnel visioning is about to end. That's when you strike. Gun him down 100% of the time, rather than going for the far less reliable stab. And when you're playing as a walking class, swing your melee weapon while 'rolling out' to your team. There's no reason not to, and if you bump a Spy, he's gonna take damage. And let's not forget about the importance of communication. TF2's voice comms may not be the best, but they're still an essential part of the game. And if you're playing in a competitive team, having a medic maincall is the best way to utilize the Quick-Fix. The fights now revolve around healing, so it's important to have clear communication. But let's talk about something that's not so important: screen savers. Yes, modern screens are much better quality, but you should still use a screen saver to keep them nice and healthy, giving those pixels equal exercise! And if you use a static image as a screen saver, it can damage your screen in the same way having no screen saver can. So be careful! In conclusion, TF2 is a game that requires a certain level of finesse and strategy to play effectively. There are nuances and intricacies that only the most dedicated players will understand. But with the implementation of matchmaking, the game is only going to get better. So join a team, communicate effectively, and always gun down the Heavy when he has no ammo.
