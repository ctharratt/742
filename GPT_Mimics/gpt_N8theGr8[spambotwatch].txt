Hey there, thanks for making me an approved submitter. I appreciate it. I've been keeping an eye on some of the comments and threads on Reddit lately, and I've noticed some suspicious activity. I'm not sure if it's bots or spammers, but something seems off. For example, I came across a thread in /r/hockey that had two comments that looked like they were removed. I'm not sure why they were removed, but one of the comments was definitely Markovian. I'm wondering if you notified the /r/hockey mods about this? It's important to keep the community safe and free from spam and bots. Speaking of bots, I've seen some strange behavior from certain accounts that could be bots. However, I'm not entirely convinced. In some threads, there are spammers commenting for weeks with generic comments like "wow, thanks for the post" and "I agree, this is a good item". It's possible that it's just a group of spammers trying to make money on pageviews, or even just one person in another country. It's hard to tell if it's a bot or not because it's not exhibiting clear bot behavior. I've also noticed some usernames that seem suspicious. They're pretty crappy and don't seem like they were created by real people. I'm not sure if these are bots or just people who don't really get Reddit. Either way, it's important to keep an eye on them and make sure they're not causing any harm to the community. One thing I find interesting is how bots and spammers are evolving. They're becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect. For example, I saw a bot that couldn't recreate the lenny face from one of the posts. It's a small detail, but it shows that bots are becoming more advanced and trying to blend in with real users. It's important for moderators to stay vigilant and keep an eye out for suspicious activity. Bots and spammers can harm the community by flooding it with irrelevant or harmful content. They can also manipulate discussions and skew the conversation in a certain direction. However, it's also important to not jump to conclusions and assume that every suspicious account is a bot or spammer. It could just be someone who doesn't understand Reddit or is new to the platform. It's important to give them the benefit of the doubt and educate them on how to use Reddit properly. In conclusion, bots and spammers are a growing problem on Reddit. They're becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect. It's important for moderators to stay vigilant and keep an eye out for suspicious activity. However, it's also important to not jump to conclusions and assume that every suspicious account is a bot or spammer. We need to give people the benefit of the doubt and educate them on how to use Reddit properly. Let's work together to keep the community safe and free from spam and bots.
