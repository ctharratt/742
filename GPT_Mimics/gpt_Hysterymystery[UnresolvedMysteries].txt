Compulsive liars are a fascinating breed of people. They have a tendency to lie about anything and everything, even when there is no apparent reason to do so. It's a strange compulsion that can be difficult to understand, but it's also something that can be overlooked if the person is otherwise a good friend or partner. I know a couple of people who are compulsive liars. They lie about the most random things, like what they had for breakfast or what they did over the weekend. It's annoying, but I keep them in my life because they are otherwise very reliable and trustworthy. They are good people who just happen to have this strange compulsion to lie. This is how everyone described Casey Anthony. She was a great friend, a great girlfriend, and a compulsive liar. Everyone knew it about her, but didn't really see it as a big deal because she treated them really well. Yeah, I think she did serve time with someone whose child drowned, although she claims she never told Casey about it. And yes, Cindy and George had a lot of issues. The problem with Casey Anthony is that as much evidence as there was against her, there was just as much exculpatory evidence to tip the scales the other way. Literally everyone raved about what a great mom she was and how much she loved Caylee. Everyone said she really didn't party that often and it wasn't really her scene, so it's hard to see why she would commit murder to go do it. She frantically called her mom the afternoon Caylee died (something you probably wouldn't do if you'd just committed premeditated murder). She has a lengthy history of lying about just about everything and hiding problems instead of dealing with them; history that implies that a hidden death and lying might not necessarily signal illegal activity. There's another viable suspect who did a ton of extremely suspicious stuff: George just can't get his story straight and seemed to be hellbent on implicating Casey, even to the point of lying. The jury just couldn't trust him. Bill Dear had some compelling stuff about Jason, but I thought it was pretty nuts that other Mezzaluna employees were either murdered or went missing and no one ever looked for a connection. Dear said that Goldman lived alone...because his roomate was stabbed to death. I mean, sheesh... And bleeding from the head! I could probably find it, but the guy who found it himself described it that way. I don't remember his exact words. I think it was something along the lines of he got a chill down his spine, but he said he turned around and saw the remains behind him. So I think you're right: it wasn't necessarily a disturbing thing to look at, but it was something that clued him in to the fact that there was a body nearby. Clothing, hair, rope. Something like that. Based on everything I've seen, I think it's a toss-up between George having some involvement and just being a compulsive liar, but the vast majority of what George said was very easily disproven and the jurors didn't believe a word he said. They all listed him as a major reason for the acquittal. I'm sure the jury would've convicted her on abuse of a corpse, but she was never charged with that. I honestly don't think the body decomposed in the car. I think that was a red herring. If you ask me, the evidence points to the body going out to Suburban Drive very close to the time of death and no significant decomp taking place in the car. The women who found him really tried to save the kid's life too, even calling the station to try to convince other officers to follow up because he looked like a young kid. So sad. They told him it couldn't be traced, and he believed them because he thought they had a "camaraderie." That's the real wtf. He was shocked that they actually wanted the murders to end. He couldn't believe the police would lie to him. He thought they liked him. Who knows what the truth is, but you have to remember, she had very good attorneys who knew that after the initial interviews, nothing would change those charges. I mean, really, do you think if Casey had claimed it was an accident at any point while sitting in jail that anyone would have believed her? That they would've dropped the charges? She did agree to talk at several points and each time her attorneys talked her out of it. If you believe Baez, after George refused to clear the whole thing up at the grand jury, she told police she wanted to tell them what happened, but he talked her out of it. The media whitewashed a lot of it, but there's a lot more suspiciousness surrounding George than most people think. From the very beginning, he was very anti-Casey when speaking to the police, but when he would speak to the media (or to Casey herself), he was acting like Zanny was real. He even gave some weird interview where he claimed they had the kidnappers under surveillance. (The real factor here seems to be Cindy. He's pro-casey when he's with Cindy, anti-Casey when she's not around.) Then he'd go back to the police, tell them not to tell Cindy he was there, and talk bad about Casey again. He claims to have a perfect memory of what happened on June 16th, which was supposedly some random day a month ago. He's claiming to remember details like what color socks everyone was wearing. But when you look at the electronic records, his version of events didn't happen. And it's not like he just got the time wrong. He didn't witness Casey leaving at all that day. Why is he claiming to be home alone all afternoon when Casey is there the whole time surfing the web? So then he claims to have this fight with Casey over gas cans where she's trying to keep him away from the trunk. He testified that he didn't see in the trunk and was too far away to smell it. Well, the defense pulls up his original statement to police and in that version of events, he was standing right next to her and described the contents of her trunk. Maybe that doesn't seem like a really big change, but the prosecution is trying to prove Casey had a body in her car that she was hiding from George. He knew there was no body in the trunk on that date and not only did he say nothing, he changed his story to help the prosecution. When the police asked George why he wasn't calling Casey during that month and trying to figure out what was going on and he made up some story about chasing Casey down the freeway in his car. Police went through phone and ezpass records and the whole thing never happened. Anything that helped the prosecution, he claimed to have a perfect memory of. But any time he was being questioned by the defense, he would suddenly have amnesia. He claimed he couldn't understand simple questions, etc. The jury was very suspicious that he was so interested in sandbagging the defense. In the end, the Casey Anthony trial was a fascinating case that will be studied for years to come. It's a case that raises more questions than it answers, and it's a case that will continue to be debated for years to come. But one thing is for sure: Casey Anthony is a compulsive liar who got away with murder.
