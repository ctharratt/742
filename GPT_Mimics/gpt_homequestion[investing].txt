Are brokerage accounts insured better than bank accounts? I mean, sure, you could have your cash sitting at home like some kind of doomsday prepper, but why not just put it in a brokerage account? That way, you can invest it and potentially make even more money. Plus, brokerage accounts are insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which means that if your brokerage firm goes bankrupt, you can get up to $500,000 of your securities and cash back. That's way better than the FDIC insurance on bank accounts, which only covers up to $250,000. But let's talk about investing. I don't know about you, but I don't gain anything by having a bunch of cash in my checking account. No interest, no growth, nothing. That's why I invest in ETFs and mutual funds. And yeah, the expense ratios on some of those funds can be pretty high, but there are plenty of low-cost options out there. For example, the "Admiral" mutual funds from Vanguard have an expense ratio of 0.05%, which is pretty damn low. Now, some people might argue that targeted retirement funds are the way to go. But I'm not so sure. Sure, they're designed to limit risk as you get older, but what about the potential for higher returns? The only way a targeted fund is better is if there's a crash right before you retire. But what if there isn't? What if the market keeps going up and up? Then you're missing out on potential gains. And don't even get me started on bond funds. Yeah, they can make money, but not nearly as much as stocks. Plus, they're not impervious to crashes either. Remember the dot-com bubble? That lasted about the same amount of time as the recession in 2008. And who knows what investing was like during the Great Depression? Maybe it would be a good idea to familiarize ourselves with what could happen if something like that happened again. But let's not be too pessimistic. I mean, sure, there are plenty of world economies on the brink of collapse, but there are also plenty of opportunities for growth. And if we're smart about our investments, we can take advantage of those opportunities. That's why I invest in VTI in my Roth IRA. And yeah, there's always the risk of missing out on potential gains, but that's just the nature of investing. You have to weigh the potential risks and rewards and make the best decision for yourself. And speaking of Roth IRAs, why the hell aren't you maxing yours out every year? It's a tax-advantaged account, which means you don't have to pay taxes on gains unless you actually withdraw those profits. Plus, there are plenty of Vanguard funds with low minimums, so there's really no excuse not to invest. Now, let's talk about options. I don't know about you, but I find them pretty confusing. I mean, what the hell is an underlying asset price? And how many days to ex-dividend? And what's the difference between exercising your option and selling the contract? It's enough to make your head spin. But here's what I do know: options can be a great way to hedge your bets and potentially make some money. For example, you could buy a put option on the S&P 500 if you think the market is going to crash. That way, if the market does go down, you can make some money to offset your losses. Of course, there's always the risk that the market will go up instead, but that's just the nature of investing. And let's not forget about commissions. Yeah, they can add up if you're trading a lot, but they're not the end of the world. And besides, even when things do crash, it usually happens in one day. So as long as you're not panic-selling, you should be fine. So in conclusion, are brokerage accounts insured better than bank accounts? Yes, they are. Should you invest in ETFs and mutual funds? Absolutely. Are targeted retirement funds the way to go? Maybe, maybe not. Should you invest in bond funds? Eh, probably not. Should you max out your Roth IRA every year? Hell yes. And should you dabble in options? Sure, why not? Just make sure you know what you're doing.
