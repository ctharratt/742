I recently had my nose fixed and it has been a game changer. No more stuffy nose and I can finally breathe properly. However, contrary to popular belief, my voice did not change much after the surgery. I just wanted to clarify that this is not true for everyone and may vary from person to person. On a completely different note, I want to talk about taxes. In my state, I have to pay tax on the MSRP of a product, regardless of any discounts, incentives, or trade-in money I may receive. This may not be the case in every state, so it's important to check your local tax laws before making any purchases. Speaking of purchases, I recently came across a brand called Black Box. I'm not sure if it's available across the pond, but I highly recommend it. Also, if you're looking for a convenient way to pay for gas, Speedway gas cards are my go-to. They have no fees, no expiration dates, and you can use them for the exact amount you need. Now, let's talk about driving. I love my G1W dash cam. I haven't had to use it to prove my innocence yet, but I have used it to show people the crazy drivers I encounter on the road. It's always good to have evidence in case of an accident. Speaking of accidents, it's important to take preventative measures to avoid them. For example, turn off your water main before leaving for vacation. Trust me, you don't want to come home to a flooded house. I have a friend who learned this the hard way when their laundry room on the third floor flooded while they were away for two weeks. Another preventative measure is to have auto lights in your car. It's a shame that it's not mandated by law in my area because it would make a huge difference. People often mess with the adjustment of their headlights, especially Jeep and Dodge drivers, causing a lot of accidents. Common sense is not something everyone is born with, but it can be learned. Moving on to technology, the power line network can support up to 500 mbit across multiple adapters on the same network. It's amazing how far technology has come. And if you're looking for a way to clean your touchscreen laptop, 90%+ isopropyl alcohol works wonders without leaving any residue. Now, let's talk about buying a car. My advice is to go to a dealership and spec out the model and trim you want. This will give you a price to negotiate with. Then, email all the dealers within a reasonable driving distance and say that another local dealer will give you the car for a certain price (insert Truecar price) and ask if they can beat it. You can even get their email by calling and asking for a salesman and saying you'd like to email them some specs of a car you're looking for. Dealers do trades all the time, so if they want the sale, they will find the car. One of the dealers will most likely beat the deal, and then you can pit the two lowest dealers against each other. If you have good credit, don't be afraid to get a loan from the dealer. My mother got an extra $1500 off for using Hyundai's financing option and zero interest. And if you're trading in your old car, try to sell it privately if it's in good shape. You'll always get a better deal than trading it in at a dealership. However, if you do decide to trade it in, shop around at multiple dealers to get the best offer. In terms of negotiating a raise at work, it's important to have evidence to back up your request. I once wrote a long letter with charts and proof that I had saved my company over $230,000 and asked for a 25% raise. Unfortunately, they decided to let me go instead. But jokes on them because I found a better job with more flexibility and higher pay. Karma is real. Finally, let's talk about driving again. I've been driving for 11 years and have had no tickets, but I have been in three crashes. Two were rear-endings while I was stopped legally, and one was a person making a wide left turn at a turn around and clipping my front end. I also had a deer slam into the side of my car. Sometimes, accidents happen no matter how careful you are. In conclusion, life is unpredictable and accidents happen. But by taking preventative measures and being smart with our purchases and negotiations, we can minimize the risks and maximize our success.
