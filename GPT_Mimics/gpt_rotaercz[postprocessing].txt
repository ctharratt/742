Hey everyone, I just wanted to say thank you for all the feedback on my previous post. I really appreciate all the constructive criticism and suggestions. I've taken them all into consideration and have made some changes to my post-processing workflow. Firstly, I've made sure to white balance all my images before doing any further editing. This has helped to ensure that the colors are accurate and consistent across all my photos. I've also realized that split-toning doesn't always work for every image, so I've been more careful with that technique and only use it when it's appropriate. One thing that I've been trying to focus on is the overall flow of my post-processing. I want to have a consistent approach to editing all my photos, rather than just randomly tweaking each one. I've been trying to learn more about the different techniques and tools available in Photoshop and Lightroom, and how to use them effectively. I know that I can't spend too much time on each individual photo, especially when I'm shooting weddings and have thousands of images to edit. So, I've been trying to develop a more efficient workflow that allows me to make quick adjustments to multiple images at once. I'm still experimenting with different techniques and settings, but my goal is to create an action that can apply a set of tweaks to most images and improve their overall quality. I've also realized that it's important to get a fresh perspective on my images. When I stare at the same photo for too long, I tend to overdo it with the post-processing. So, I've been asking for feedback from other photographers and artists, and it's been really helpful to get their input and suggestions. One thing that I've been struggling with is cutting people out cleanly. I've seen some amazing examples of this technique, but I just can't seem to get it right. If anyone has any tips or tutorials on how to do this effectively, I would really appreciate it. I've also been trying to learn more about different post-processing styles and techniques. I've noticed that a lot of photographers are going for a vintage, airy look, but that's not really my style. I prefer a darker, moodier look that uses shadows and contrast to create depth and dimension. If anyone has any links or resources on how to achieve this style, I would love to check them out. I've been using both Photoshop and Lightroom for my post-processing, but I'm still learning how to use them effectively. I find that Photoshop is better for more detailed editing, like removing blemishes or bags under the eyes, while Lightroom is better for overall adjustments like exposure and color correction. One thing that I've been struggling with in Lightroom is the workflow. It's not always clear how to save or export images, and I've had trouble keeping track of all the different versions of my edits. If anyone has any tips or tutorials on how to use Lightroom more effectively, I would really appreciate it. I've also been trying to improve my color correction skills. I've noticed that sometimes my images come out too warm or too cool, and I'm not always sure how to fix it. I've been experimenting with different adjustment filters and settings, but I still have a lot to learn. Overall, my goal is to create consistently beautiful photos that meet a certain standard. I know that my approach may not be optimal for every image, but as long as most of them look better, I'm happy. I'm still learning and experimenting, and I appreciate all the feedback and suggestions that I've received so far. Thank you all for your help!
