As a long-time user of KDE, I have always appreciated the level of customization and flexibility that it offers. However, I have noticed that some users expect KDE to provide every type of program under the sun, including an FTP client. In my opinion, this is not the task of KDE. KDE is primarily a desktop environment and associated programs, not a software repository. That being said, I do understand the frustration of users who are looking for a specific program and cannot find it in their distribution's repositories. In these cases, it may be necessary to look for alternative sources or even compile the program from source. However, this should not be the responsibility of KDE. Another issue that I have encountered with KDE is the use of ALT+Fx shortcuts. While some users may find these shortcuts convenient, I personally find them inconvenient to press. As a workaround, I have remapped ALT+F4 to Alt+Shift+C and use ksuperkey to remap ALT+F2 to the super key. This allows me to access the functionality of these shortcuts without having to press awkward key combinations. One issue that I have noticed with KDE is the use of screen space. Only when their 5K display is completely occupied by a titlebar and one button will they understand that screen space is a resource. In my opinion, this is a waste of valuable screen real estate. Only when your titlebar is 2 mm high will you understand that DPI scaling is good. DPI scaling allows for more efficient use of screen space and should be a priority for any desktop environment. Despite these issues, I am a big fan of KDE. I appreciate the ability to easily configure it into the classic Windows XP/7 workflow style with virtual desktops. I am not a big fan of some of the fancy new stuff in Unity and Gnome (I love my minimize buttons) so either XFCE and KDE were the right choice for me. I switched from XFCE to KDE because KDE has just more settings and allows for more customization. One of my favorite features of KDE is Dolphin, which is (in my opinion) the best file manager out there. It offers a wide range of features and customization options, making it a powerful tool for managing files and folders. Additionally, if you are on Android, you must check out KDE Connect, which has some pretty amazing features. For example, you have a shared clipboard between PC and mobile, which is very convenient when sending links and texts between devices. You can also easily send files between devices in both directions, and access and browse the whole file system with Dolphin. Making a backup of all your pictures is very easy and does not require any additional software. There are also other small features, such as pausing the music player on PC when you get an incoming call. However, there are still some issues with KDE that need to be addressed. For example, I have noticed that hidden folders are not visible in the tree view. This can be frustrating when trying to navigate through the file system. Additionally, arrow keys are not enabled for navigation in the tree view, which can make it difficult to expand and collapse subfolders. These are small issues, but they can be annoying for users who rely on the file manager for their daily workflow. In conclusion, while there are some issues with KDE, I still believe that it is one of the best desktop environments available. Its level of customization and flexibility is unmatched, and its associated programs, such as Dolphin and KDE Connect, offer a wide range of features and functionality. However, it is important to remember that KDE is primarily a desktop environment and associated programs, not a software repository. Users should not expect KDE to provide every type of program under the sun, but should instead look for alternative sources or compile programs from source if necessary.
