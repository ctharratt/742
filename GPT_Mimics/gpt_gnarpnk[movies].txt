Yep, there's always one. I mean, have you seen the latest trailer for that new sci-fi movie? It's got all the classic end-of-the-world/alien movie tropes, and I swear I heard the 2001 score over that HALO jump scene. If that's the actual score for the movie, it's gonna make it that much better. But let's talk about Christoph Waltz for a minute. I mean, the guy is a genius actor. Sure, he mostly plays villains, but what do you expect when you make such a mark in the first movie you're in created and released by Americans? And with our fever of typecasting, he'll be hard pressed to get any high paying gigs thrown at him that aren't in the villainous category. But I will admit, I'm only a cursory fan of his acting, mostly the character of Landa from Basterds. So he might have done a good guy role in an American movie that went under my radar. If he signs onto the "Pirates" franchise, I'm instantly sold a ticket. And speaking of franchises, have you heard the rumors about the new Star Wars sequels? I've heard it's going to involve Han and Leia's grandbaby, but who knows how valid that rumor is at this point. And the idea of a Darth Mickey would be awesome. Like a cartoon short before the movie, or before any Disney movie. Maybe have Darth Mickey fighting a Cyclops version of Donald the Duck. But let's get back to the topic at hand. I read this article about a new horror movie coming out in January. It's got all the telltale signs of a cult movie in the making. The actors didn't want anything to do with it, and it's not even getting screened for critics (which is a dumb process anyways). That means nobody will see it except for the people who do, and then 20 years down the road, people will start loving it for what it is and not judge it by somebody else's opinion of it. That's the way movies are supposed to be watched. But wait, did you know that Timothy Dalton played a time lord, Prince Barin, AND Bond? I'm switching my vote from Connery to Dalton. And while we're on the topic of movies, I have to say that Neighborhood Watch (OT) was funny as hell. And it's not IT, I've seen and read IT multiple times. The book is definitely better than the mini-series. And let's not forget about Monster Squad or the original Fright Night. Anyway, I just thought it was funny that what Christoph Waltz said in that one interview sounded similar to what the bad guy said at the end of Temple of Doom when he died in the same relative way. But let's not get too sidetracked. The point is, there's always one person who sees the potential in a movie that others don't. And who knows, maybe this new horror movie will be the next big cult classic.
