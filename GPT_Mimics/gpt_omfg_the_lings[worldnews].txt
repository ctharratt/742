I'm not trying to downplay the violence committed by Muslims, but I think it's important to extend the same benefit of the doubt to statistics about Muslims as we do to largely Christian groups. It's hypocritical for /r/worldnews to only focus on Muslim violence and ignore the violence committed by other groups. I mean, come on, using thereligionofpeace.com as a source? That's a joke. It's clear that the person who suggested that site is living in a bubble of blind hate and has zero self-awareness. It's sad, really. And let's not forget about the massive cover-ups of pedophile rings in Europe and the Catholic Church. Non-Muslims murder each other en masse and rape young women all over the world. It's not just Muslims who commit atrocities. But for some reason, it's only Muslims who are being bombed for decades. The amount of shit they've been put through in that time is pretty staggering. And yet, people still choose to focus on Muslims and ignore the atrocities committed by other groups. And don't even get me started on the Israeli regime and those who support it. They are shitbags, plain and simple. It's not about being anti-Semitic, it's about being against their racist and xenophobic policies. As for the War on Terror, if ISIS were simply against American interventionism, they would be targeting American interests and personnel, not innocent Iraqi and Syrian civilians. They're just using that as an excuse to justify their wholesale slaughter of people who don't align with their religious and political ideals. And let's not forget about the way men treat women as sex objects. It's not just Muslims who do it, a large number of men really seem to think it's open season on women. It's a problem that exists in all cultures, not just Muslim ones. But of course, people like to see everything in black and white. They think every Muslim is an extremist who chants for the death of Jews, and every protestor of Israel and their military's murder of innocent civilians agrees with extremists. It's ridiculous. And don't even get me started on the way the media portrays certain groups of people. It's all about perpetuating stereotypes and fear-mongering. It's sickening. But at the end of the day, we need to remember that there are good and bad people in every group. It's not fair to generalize and demonize an entire group of people based on the actions of a few. We need to focus on the individual and their actions, not their religion or ethnicity. In conclusion, we need to extend the same benefit of the doubt to all groups of people, not just the ones we happen to agree with. We need to focus on the individual and their actions, not their religion or ethnicity. And we need to stop perpetuating stereotypes and fear-mongering in the media.
