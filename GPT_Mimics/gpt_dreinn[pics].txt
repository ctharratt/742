Well, well, well. It seems like we have a grammar police officer in our midst. /u/MandyCandy95 is pointing out that there shouldn't be an apostrophe in "employees" in your title. While it's true that grammar is important, let's not get too caught up in the small details, shall we? I mean, we're all here to have a good time and share our thoughts and opinions. If we start nitpicking every little mistake, we'll never get anything done. But that's not the real issue here. The real issue is the downvoting. Come on, people. There's no need to downvote every single comment that /u/MandyCandy95 makes. Sure, you might not agree with them, but that doesn't mean you have to be petty and vindictive. And now that OP's comments are being downvoted too? That's just ridiculous. Let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. We're all here to share our thoughts and opinions, and sometimes those opinions might clash. But that doesn't mean we have to resort to downvoting and name-calling. We're better than that. Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room. /u/funsidy made a comment that some people are calling "crass ambulance chasing." While I can see where they're coming from, I don't think it's fair to jump to conclusions. Yes, the comment was made from a brand new account, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a scam. And yes, it might seem a little opportunistic to try and take advantage of a tragedy, but let's give them the benefit of the doubt. That being said, /u/funsidy could definitely work on their PR skills. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to be more careful about how they present themselves. Making a comment like that without any context or explanation is bound to raise some eyebrows. Moving on, let's talk about some of the other comments in this thread. There's a lot of sarcasm and snarkiness going on, and while I appreciate a good joke as much as the next person, let's try to keep it civil. We're all adults here (I hope), so let's act like it. One comment that really stood out to me was the one about Africa. "No it's just Africa. Just fucking somewhere on the giant continent. It's all the same, you know." This kind of attitude is not only ignorant, it's also incredibly offensive. Africa is a diverse and complex continent with a rich history and culture. To dismiss it as "all the same" is not only disrespectful, it's also just plain wrong. On a lighter note, I want to give a shoutout to the person who made the .kmz for Google Earth of Watney's journey. That's some serious dedication right there. And the person who used macro tubes to take pictures of their friends' eyes? Super cool. But let's not forget about the person who drove their '55 T-Bird to the All-Ford Nationals in Carlisle. That's some serious dedication too. I can understand why some people might want to trailer their cars, especially if they're rare or valuable, but there's something special about driving it under its own power. And finally, let's talk about the person who wants to make something in Minecraft. Rocks are heavy, my friend. But if you're determined enough, I'm sure you can make it happen. In conclusion, let's try to be a little kinder to each other. We're all here to have a good time and share our thoughts and opinions. Let's not get too caught up in the small details, and let's try to keep it civil. And if you're going to make a comment, make sure it's something worth saying. Don't just post for the sake of posting.
