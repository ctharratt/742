If we're talking about Wrestlemania, then we need to talk about the potential for a ratings change. But let's not jump to conclusions based on just one show. One show does not change a rating. We need more than that to come to an informed opinion. Last year, people thought the same thing, and then Seth Rollins came out and got the main event over hard. There are other options at their disposal, and the title should always be last, unless it's the Rumble. Put them all in the ARMBAR. Have Bray Wyatt turn on the rest of the Wyatts while Big Show et al are still there, and have them look confused as hell. Then eliminate the rest. Bray needs to get out on his own. But let's back up a bit. Your problem here is that you stepped into the ring. And I am already in the ring. And if we compare you to me... well, you are woefully inadequate to the task. There are 32 Gravediggers. 8 are still used at rallies. Just use one of the retired ones. Yes, Wrestlemania is typically held on a Sunday. That would ruin the whole hearse thing... Get off Reddit, Dad. You know as well as I do that New Jack would tell you to cut it out. I always get the downvotes for it, but what the hell... I've always wanted Undertaker to arrive in Gravedigger. Why? Because it would be awesome, that's why. And let's be real, Trump would be a hindrance to the WWE, what with all the international talent. Do they have New Day underpants? I need something for my booty... something for my booty... (insert gyrations) Ah, but let's get back to the topic at hand. Use an injury angle to fix a condition. I will accept this. Bray should turn on his family. "Even the buzzards will feed upon their own kind." FFS he needs a main event push. 'Tis a poor man who resorts to mocking an obvious typo. It's like in Rocky III - Apollo Creed is training him. In winter I spend the majority of my free time on the internet as well. Once it warms up, I spend a lot of it outside. Front page this shit. Now, let's talk about the potential for a ratings change. If we have similar indications past Wrestlemania, then I will accept a possibility of a ratings change. Until then, we need more than just 1 show to come to an informed opinion. One show does not change a rating. There are possibilities. People thought the same last year, and then they unleashed Seth and got the main event over hard. There are other options at their disposal. But let's not forget about the potential for a brand split. Would it be a good idea? I disagree. I never watch Smackdown anyway. I certainly wouldn't watch it if the brands split. And let's not forget about the potential for a proxy. Shane has to be the one to wrestle. Why can't people just accept that? Still need Kalisto in there. People are expecting a multi-man match for it, I think. And let's not forget about the use of fake blood. Complaining about it is not "Being A Bummer About Wrestlemania." Who's whining? I've yet to read a single complaint since Raw. Does Big E just wear his singlet everywhere? I would like to point out that we, the fans, appeared to have had a voice in changing the last two Wrestlemania main events. I will grant you it may have been planned that way, but it did appear to be a reaction to us. Not unexpected. But definitely looked forward to. A 'save' that's actually plausible. I must meditate on this. But let's not forget about the potential for a split between The Rock and Roman Reigns. They aren't even related. Amituana Anoa'i and Peter Maivia became blood brothers, which is a big deal with Samoans. But they're technically not family. However, TIL that Roman and Rosey are brothers. Do WCW champions count before the buyout? Cause you can add Ron Simmons to the list. He only had a dye job in Pacific Rim. And they have no idea who he is? It's not like he hasn't done mainstream movies. And let's not forget about the potential for a celebrity HOF inductee. As a real tribute to Lemmy, he should be the one. Well, I'd be upset. Would I change my viewing habits? It would have to actually happen to know. I remember watching Wrestlemania 17, and they had the "show highlights" video completed to show at the end of the show, including what just happened 2 minutes prior. Say what you want about storyline, but the production crew is top-notch and can pull stuff like this with 5 minutes warning. But let's not forget about the potential for announcers and writers. We need a Tough Enough-type program on the Network, but to get announcers. Hell, they already have it at Axxess for people to call a match. We need one for writers too, but that won't happen. I wouldn't have thought Tough Enough forced people into gimmicks, actually... There were far far worse gimmicks than that was. And let's not forget about the potential for John Cena. He gets booed by half the audience. The other half cheers for him. And he doesn't ignore the boos. He embraces it, and uses it to get himself over even more. Reigns is an adequate wrestler. But he can't cut a promo to save his life. Until there's a tweet of Roman getting stitches, like every other on-air cut the last 5 years, I will continue to believe it was fake. In conclusion, there are a lot of potential storylines and changes that could happen at Wrestlemania. But let's not jump to conclusions based on just one show. One show does not change a rating. We need more than that to come to an informed opinion. And let's not forget about the potential for a brand split, a proxy, a celebrity HOF inductee, announcers and writers, and John Cena. It's going to be an exciting event, and I can't wait to see what happens.
