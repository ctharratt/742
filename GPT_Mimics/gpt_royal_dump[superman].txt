Oh man, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. What a movie. I remember when the first trailer dropped and everyone lost their minds. And then the second trailer came out and people lost their minds even more. And then the third trailer came out and people were like, "Okay, we get it, this movie is going to be epic." But you know what? It was. It really was. I mean, sure, it had its flaws. The pacing was a bit wonky, and some of the dialogue was a little clunky. But overall, it was a damn good time at the movies. And can we talk about that ending? Spoilers, obviously, but holy crap. Superman dies. They actually went there. And then Batman carries his body, and it's just this incredibly powerful moment. And then, of course, he comes back in Justice League, but still. That moment in BvS was just...wow. Speaking of trailers, though, why do so many people feel the need to make their own versions of them? I mean, I get it, trailers are cool and all, but it seems like there are a million fan-made trailers for BvS out there. And not just for BvS, either. It's like every big superhero movie gets a million fan-made trailers. I don't see this for any other genre of movie. You don't see a bunch of fan-made trailers for romantic comedies or horror movies or whatever. It's just superhero movies. Why is that? I think part of it has to do with the fact that superhero movies are just so damn cool. There's something about seeing these larger-than-life characters on the big screen that just gets people excited. And when you combine that with epic music and slick editing, it's no wonder people want to make their own trailers. But here's the thing: most of these fan-made trailers are pretty bad. They either use generic music or they try to use the actual movie score and it just doesn't work. And then there are the ones that use footage from other movies or TV shows, which is just lazy. If you're going to make a fan-made trailer, at least put some effort into it. Speaking of effort, can we talk about Henry Cavill's hair in BvS? Specifically, how tiny his head looks because of it? I mean, I get that he's supposed to have curly hair, but it just looks weird. And then there's the whole thing with the light shining through it, which makes it look even weirder. I don't know, maybe I'm just nitpicking, but it's something that's always bothered me about the movie. But let's talk about something positive: the voiceover in the trailers. I thought it was really effective. It set the tone for the movie and gave us a sense of what was at stake. And the music...well, the music was kind of dumb, to be honest. It didn't really fit the tone of the movie. But that's okay, because the actual movie score was amazing. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL knocked it out of the park. Speaking of Superman, can we talk about how some people post stuff in the wrong subreddit? I mean, I get that there's a lot of overlap between different superhero subreddits, but come on. If you're going to post something about Supergirl, post it in the Supergirl subreddit. Don't post it in the Superman subreddit just because it's vaguely related. And while we're on the subject of Superman, can we talk about how he's different from Batman? I mean, obviously they're both superheroes, but they have very different approaches to crime-fighting. Batman is a detective first and foremost. He uses his brains to solve crimes and take down bad guys. Superman, on the other hand, is a super-powered alien who can punch through walls and shoot lasers from his eyes. They're both awesome in their own way, but they're very different. Speaking of Superman again (I really like Superman, okay?), can we talk about how he's portrayed in different media? Specifically, can we talk about how he's portrayed in Smallville? I know some people didn't like that show, but I thought it was pretty good. And Tom Welling was a great Clark Kent/Superman. I would love to see him come back and play the character again, maybe in a new movie or TV show. But let's talk about something else for a minute: the Death of Superman. Specifically, can we talk about how we want to see that story on the big screen? I mean, they kind of did it in BvS, but it wasn't really the same thing. I want to see a standalone Superman movie where he dies and then comes back in the black suit with the rockstar hairstyle. That would be amazing. Speaking of amazing, can we talk about the fact that they restored the original Superman movie and released it on Blu-ray? I mean, sure, it's not perfect quality, but it's still pretty damn cool. And speaking of cool, can we talk about how I met Jon Schnepp, the director of The Death of "Superman Lives": What Happened? That was pretty cool. But let's get back to BvS for a minute. Specifically, can we talk about how awesome the costumes were? I mean, sure, some people didn't like the new Superman suit, but I thought it was pretty cool. And the Batman suit was amazing. And Wonder Woman's costume? Holy crap, that was awesome. I can't wait to see what they do with her in her own movie. Speaking of Wonder Woman, can we talk about how excited we are for her movie? I mean, sure, the DCEU has had its ups and downs, but Wonder Woman looks like it's going to be amazing. And Gal Gadot is perfect in the role. I can't wait to see her kick some ass. But let's talk about something else for a minute: bald actors. Specifically, can we talk about how people are complaining that Jesse Eisenberg doesn't look like Lex Luthor because he's not bald? I mean, come on. It's not like they couldn't have shaved his head if they wanted to. And besides, he's a great actor. I thought he did a really good job as Luthor. Speaking of doing a good job, can we talk about the music in BvS again? Specifically, can we talk about how people keep uploading pointless trailer music videos to YouTube? I mean, I get that people want to listen to the music from the trailers, but these videos are just pointless. They're not the actual soundtrack from the movie, they're just made to match the trailer cuts. So why bother? But let's end on a positive note: BvS was a great movie. Sure, it had its flaws, but it was still a great movie. And it set up the DCEU in a really interesting way. I can't wait to see where they go from here.
