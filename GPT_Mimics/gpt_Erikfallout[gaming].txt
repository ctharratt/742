As a gamer, I have a lot of opinions on various games and genres. I recently had a conversation with a friend who is an indie game developer, and it got me thinking about what makes a great game. Here are some of my thoughts on the matter. First and foremost, I believe that story is the most important aspect of a game. Games like The Last of Us, Final Fantasy, and Metal Gear Solid have won countless awards because of their incredible storytelling. People love to be immersed in a world and feel like they are a part of the story. A game can have amazing graphics and gameplay, but if the story is lacking, it will not be remembered as a great game. That being said, gameplay is also important. A game can have a great story, but if the gameplay is clunky or unenjoyable, it will not be a success. Games like Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda have stood the test of time because they have both great stories and enjoyable gameplay. A game should be fun to play, and the gameplay should complement the story. As an indie game developer, my friend was focused on creating a point-and-click game. I think that this genre is perfect for storytelling, as games like Telltale's The Walking Dead have shown. However, I cautioned my friend to not neglect the gameplay aspect. Point-and-click games can sometimes feel slow and tedious, so it's important to keep the player engaged with interesting puzzles and mechanics. We also discussed the importance of character customization and fighting systems in games. While these aspects can be fun and add to the overall experience, they should not be the main focus. Games like Street Fighter IV and Injustice have multiple versions and DLCs, which can make it feel like the developers are just trying to make money. This can ruin the reputation of a game and turn off players. Another aspect of gaming that we discussed was the importance of fast travel options. While it's important to have a large world to explore, it can become tedious to have to travel long distances repeatedly. Games like Far Cry 4 could benefit from more fast travel options to keep the gameplay flowing smoothly. We also talked about the importance of genre preference. Everyone has their own tastes when it comes to games, and that's okay. Just because someone doesn't enjoy a certain game or genre doesn't make them any less of a gamer. It's important to respect each other's preferences and not judge based on personal opinions. One game that sparked a lot of debate was Call of Duty. While it's a popular franchise, it's often criticized for being too focused on multiplayer and lacking in story. Some people consider it a "childish" game, while others enjoy it for its competitive nature. Personally, I think that it's important for a game to have a balance between multiplayer and story. Games like Halo have done this well, with a strong single-player campaign and a popular multiplayer mode. Finally, we talked about the importance of nostalgia in gaming. Games like Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 3 hold a special place in the hearts of many gamers, and it's important to remember the classics that got us into gaming in the first place. However, it's also important to keep an open mind and try new games and genres. In conclusion, there are many aspects that make a great game, but story and gameplay are the most important. It's important for developers to focus on both aspects and not neglect one for the other. Fast travel options and genre preference are also important factors to consider. And while nostalgia is important, it's also important to keep an open mind and try new things. As gamers, we should respect each other's preferences and not judge based on personal opinions.
