Yo, what's up guys? I was just checking out some pics and I gotta say, that graphic designer in one of them is probably making bank. I mean, I'd do whatever he's doing for some good pay, you know what I'm saying? And did you see what he's using as a pin quill? A boob! That's some creative shit right there. But let's talk about those other pics, man. They're pretty damn fascinating. I bet the OP and his friends are getting all the sex based on that one picture. And don't even get me started on those Trump lovers on /r/The_Donald. Bunch of fucking retards, I tell ya. Anyone who seriously supports Trump is literally and figuratively retarded. I bet even Honey Boo Boo's mom is a huge Trump supporter (and by huge, I don't mean her obese weight). Now, let's talk about movies. How the hell have you never seen Rocky? Are you like 15 or something? I mean, come on, most people have seen at least one of the Rocky movies. Personally, I don't like the first two very much, but 3 is good and 4 is my favorite. You gotta watch them in order though, at least once in your life. And if you're younger, they might seem outdated, but that's just because they came out in the late 70s. They're not cheesy, just a product of their time. And speaking of movies, what the hell is Chappie? I mean, I knew a little about the apartheid stuff, but I just didn't enjoy the movie. Elysium, on the other hand, was great. I mean, the thought of having a huge space station up there where everything is chill and on Earth everything is shit? That's some trippy shit right there. And those body suits? Cool as hell. But putting on the exoskeleton with his clothes still on? Weak. Now, let's talk about District 9. I've only gotten through about a third of the movie a couple times before turning it off. I mean, come on, some humans are going to go evicting these aliens that could kill them at any second? That's just weak. Those aliens could have killed anybody that came up to them, but instead they were docile and treated like shit. Elysium was way better in my opinion. And don't even get me started on North Korea. How the hell can they believe that the world is in awe of their shit when there are huge buildings on the China side of the river and huts on the North Korean side? It's just ridiculous. But let's talk about something more important: food. Have you guys seen those pre-made meatballs at Albertsons in the deli section? They look dank as hell. I'm not much of a chef, so I don't know how to make meatballs, but I'd love to try those. They're kind of expensive, but I'm worth it. And speaking of worth it, have you seen that horse in one of the pics? That's one sexy horse. Like, almost human sexy. I mean, I want to mount that horse. Have intercourse with it. And that horn inside the baby zebra in another pic? Not exactly helping. Anyway, I don't want to get old and die from old age. All those symptoms and shit? No thanks. And those bugs in the space ship in one of the pics? Cheap and fake as hell. But you know what's not fake? That hottie on the right in another pic. Damn. And finally, let's talk about weed. I mean, I love sci-fi stuff and I'm watching it right now and enjoying the hell out of it. But some retard on /r/trees is probably like "duuuuude... I could totally make a bong out of that like... dude, I could like post a picture of it with some of my weed maaan. That would be cool, because I smoke weed maan and like, I take pictures of it and post em on reddit cuz that would be cool duuude." But hey, to each their own. Anyway, thanks for chatting with me about all this stuff. It's nice to have a conversation on reddit without people going ape shit. And if you haven't tried those pre-made meatballs at Albertsons, you're missing out.
