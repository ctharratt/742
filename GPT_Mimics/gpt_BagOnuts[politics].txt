Typical "inside the US" comment. When you get your news from mainstream media, you're going to be severely misinformed, my friend. Oh Hillary, did you forget to take your corporate donations today? Poor thing! Can someone please help her get back to Wall Street? Because she's an outspoken liar. Yet the mainstream media has seen articles voted to the top from CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and countless other biased publications on a daily basis for years. I guess the only publications that aren't "legitimate sources" come from the left, huh? Lol, it's only because the mainstream media is owned by corporations, and they know the only way to maintain their profits is if Clinton is elected. When this whole email scandal started last year, the mainstream media was chastising conservatives and Republicans as morons for trying to spotlight it. But now that the primaries are in full swing they're doing a better job at attacking Sanders than the Republicans were. And you people wonder why the rest of America loathes the mainstream media. Haha, look who's talking. You didn't even spell the name of the candidate right. Yes. A candidate with millions of supporters is contributing to a political revolution 100 times bigger than the daily top-of-the-hour mainstream media propaganda. Seriously... you are in some deep denial, buddy. I like how you have to go through someone's comment history in order to attempt to make a valid argument against their claim. Seems like I touched a nerve. Gotta love it when people result to personal attacks because their argument doesn't hold up to the facts. Yes, they did. Her motto was freaking "I'm with her" for Christ's sake. People literally compared her to Margaret Thatcher, and saw her as the driving force of political establishment. So really, how naive are you? Not negative- realistic. I'm tired of seeing delusion comments like the one I was responding to get upvoted. People who are stuck in a bubble and refuse to look at things realistically shouldn't be praised. Because some mainstream media outlet will surely make waves in the real world, right? If you want a revolution, it needs national attention. Not the attention of a couple of billionaires on Wall Street. People said the same thing about Sanders in 2015... Look how that turned out. You can create a revolution with one inspiring person at the top. It works that way in a democratic government. Revolution? Sorry to break it to you, but that's going to happen. Revolutions happen from the top down, not the bottom up. You can put all your focus and resources into one presidential candidate and expect there to be a revolution. Who is Hillary or Hillary Supporters backing at the local level? How is she helping people with her vision get elected to the legislator? Oh, that's right- she's not. Sanders is doing more to get progressives elected than Clinton. Let that little nugget of info sink in for a minute. This is why the OWS movement failed and this is why the Clinton movement will fail. You want to see how an actual modern-day political revolution works? Look at the Sanders movement. Regardless of how you feel about it, they got their people elected at the ground level and won over more local governments than any other political movement in decades. Look at all the Democratic governors. Look at all the local state governments that turned blue. Look at the Democratic controlled congress. That is the kind of movement you need for there to be a revolution- one old man at the top who if, by some miracle, got elected, would be able to get all of his policies through the legislature anyway. They give it a hard time because as soon as Clinton wins the primary these hypocrites will be backing Sanders and we'll see nothing but positive articles about him. I'm failing to see what the big deal is, unless people are mad that she got corporate donations. Are you kidding me? Of course that's what people are mad about! I honestly can't wait until he wins the primaries and all of these fucking hypocrites go and vote for him anyway. I know that the majority of America would not vote for a corrupt, untrustworthy, establishment politician for president of the United States. But, please, keep thinking she has a chance. If Democrats somehow miraculously made this woman their nominee then there is no doubt in my mind that we would see a repeat of 2016 in the general election. If you think that means anything other than it's freakin January then you're in denial. Clinton has zero chance in a general election. She could never win swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Iowa, and Ohio. The Clinton-bots can deny it all they want, but it's just inevitably true. Knowing this, Sanders is backing Sanders because supporting someone who aligns with you 100% of the time and can actually become president is better than supporting someone who aligns with you 89% of the time and has no chance at being president. Yeah, we need to keep them looking at CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and other completely biased and uncivil top-level submissions here. /s "My personal experience is different, so the statistical data must be wrong!" Exactly. Sanders getting the nomination would be a dream come true for Progressives. An elderly, charismatic, Jewish, self-proclaimed democratic socialist as the Democratic Nominee? Even Trump couldn't win against that. Uh, the Fair Tax is a regressive tax. It's arguably more regressive than our current federal tax system. Typical "inside the US" comment.
