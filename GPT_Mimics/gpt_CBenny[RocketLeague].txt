Hey guys, I just found out that the Oceanic server has been taken down. I'm not sure why, but it's causing some issues for players in Sydney, like myself. I've been getting errors when searching for games, and it seems like others are experiencing the same thing. However, there is a workaround. If you click on the server option again, you can choose the US or Euro servers instead. I've tried this and it's actually playable, so it's definitely worth a shot if you're having trouble finding games on the Oceanic server. It's a shame that the Oceanic server has been taken down, as it was a great option for players in Australia and New Zealand. It provided a low ping and a better overall gaming experience. Hopefully, it will be back up and running soon. In the meantime, I've been playing on the US and Euro servers and it's been okay. The ping is a bit higher, but it's still playable. I've noticed that there are more players on these servers, which means that there are more games to choose from. This is definitely a plus, as it can be frustrating waiting for a game to start on the Oceanic server. One thing to keep in mind is that the gameplay may be slightly different on the US and Euro servers. This is because the servers are located in different regions, which can affect the gameplay. However, I haven't noticed any major differences so far. Overall, I think it's great that there are other server options available. It shows that the developers are listening to the community and are willing to make changes to improve the gaming experience. I'm looking forward to seeing what other changes they will make in the future. In the meantime, I'll continue playing on the US and Euro servers. It's not ideal, but it's better than not being able to play at all. I'm hoping that the Oceanic server will be back up and running soon, as it was a great option for players in this region. In conclusion, if you're having trouble finding games on the Oceanic server, try switching to the US or Euro servers. It's not ideal, but it's playable. Hopefully, the Oceanic server will be back up and running soon, but in the meantime, it's good to have other options available.
