One brewery that has been making waves in the industry is Brooklyn Brewery, known for their bold and innovative beers. And now, they are expanding their operations with a new brewery in Staten Island. But this isn't the only big move that Brooklyn Brewery is making. The company is also in the process of moving the majority of its brewing operation from Utica to a brand new, $70 million hub on Staten Island.

The new brewery in Staten Island will be a state-of-the-art facility, featuring the latest brewing technology and equipment. It will also include a tasting room and restaurant, where visitors can sample the brewery's beers and enjoy a meal. But why Staten Island? According to Brooklyn Brewery co-founder Steve Hindy, the decision to build the new brewery on Staten Island was based on a number of factors, including the availability of space, the proximity to New York City, and the support of local officials. "We looked at a number of different locations, but Staten Island really stood out," Hindy said. "It's a great location for us, with easy access to the city and plenty of room to grow." The new brewery is expected to create hundreds of jobs in the area, both during construction and once it is up and running. It will also help to boost the local economy, as visitors come to the area to sample the brewery's beers and enjoy the surrounding attractions. But what about the beer itself? Brooklyn Brewery is known for its bold and innovative brews, and the new brewery in Staten Island will be no exception. The brewery plans to continue experimenting with new flavors and styles, while also producing some of its classic beers. "We're always looking for new and exciting ways to push the boundaries of what beer can be," Hindy said. "And with this new brewery, we'll have even more opportunities to do that." So what can beer lovers expect from Brooklyn Brewery's new brewery in Staten Island? According to Hindy, they can expect a wide range of unique and flavorful beers, as well as a welcoming and inviting atmosphere. "We want people to come to our brewery and feel like they're part of the family," he said. "We want them to enjoy our beers, learn about the brewing process, and have a great time." Overall, the new brewery in Staten Island is an exciting development for Brooklyn Brewery and for craft beer lovers everywhere.
