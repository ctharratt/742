I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to lose faith in Manchester City's ability to keep their spot in the top 4. They've looked pretty average in their last few games, and Kolarov never seems to apologize when he blasts it over the bar. It's no wonder our players don't turn up for the national team when fans are utter cunts to them. And for some reason, we hate it when any young Englishman tries to better himself. I assume you mean like the band and not some Kafkaesque situation. But let's not get too carried away, it's only a game against Chelsea. Howard Webb doesn't play for United anymore, so we might have a chance. Although, I have to say, Martial has been pretty wank lately. I can't see them keeping their spot in the top 4, to be honest. Ray Winstone has your money now, NBC has lost the plot with their silence and weird angles. And what's with Morgan, the quintessential brick shithouse giant? I have to say, I found it pretty hilarious when I saw someone wearing a P45 and a Mourinho mask. And Adam arguing with Rooney was like Saturday night outside the kebab van at 2am all over again. We've had a relatively mild winter so far, but Martial has been woeful. That much velcro could come in handy, though. I know everyone's saying Stoke will win this one, but have you even watched Chelsea this season? What happened to Valencia? He was one-dimensional, but he did a job. Slim, there's no need to tarnish his legacy. He's smarter than that. So, Wayne Rooney then? Memphis has been utter dogshit on both goals. We need a Keano out there to take him to task for that shit. And fucking hell, every goal is immediately punctuated with the commentator mentioning how bad this is for United and the pressure on LvG. Give credit to Stoke, at least in the moment. Say what you want about Lee Nelson, but that's a pretty amazing image. And chill out, Walcott, it wasn't that bad. It was one of the Henry moments on Sky that I actually enjoyed. There's nothing wrong with having opinions and speculating, but there's a subtlety to it that some people lack. I have to say, 'Arry hasn't contributed much to the world of football. He's a typical little Englander. But people still actually write this? Of course, you know more than a manager who has been in charge at huge clubs and coached some of the best players in the world. To be fair, that ref took a bit of a dive. Di Canio's push wasn't that bad. And let Mourinho learn from his mistakes. He's the most successful manager in Chelsea's history and maybe the greatest manager in the modern game. Fabregas was one of the best players in the first half of last season, but he's been woeful for 18 months now. He looks way off the pace and is constantly out of position on goals. The amount of times they show a goal against Chelsea and you can see Fab strolling back 20 yards away. Barca got rid of him, and Wenger didn't bring him back for a reason. Who would you replace them with? Lewandowski, Neymar, Ronaldo, Krychiowak? Alba? Stones? Stoke, Leicester, West Ham, among others, have managed to find some real quality knocking around. I'm sure Chelsea can do the same. Instead of buying huge names, look at Spurs. There were a lot of passengers in that team, and slowly the manager has weeded out the crap. They look like a decent outfit now. Fabregas and Matic come to mind. I'd keep Matic, to be honest. Fab is surplus to requirements. But you need to replace Mourinho. He is the problem. There are more skilled managers on the market than available world-class players. Give Mou some hungry players who want to learn and listen from one of the best managers the game has seen, and you'll see a better Chelsea. Bowing to the whims of overpaid stars and sacking the manager won't do anything. There's a lot of deadwood that's been exposed this season. Ivanovic is shite. He lacks pace, isn't particularly good on the ball, and his final ball is woeful. Pedro and Fab can't defend for shit. Costa doesn't seem to suit having three number 10s around him. Terry has always been slow, but errors and bad decisions have crept into his game. It doesn't help when Ramires, never the greatest footballer to begin with, now goes walkabout. Three or four hungry quality players around the likes of Hazard and William would rejuvenate Chelsea. This season is fucked anyway. A new manager isn't going to get top 4, etc. They may as well keep Mou, have a huge clear-out in the summer or beforehand, and give Mou the money to buy some real quality. Let him have a go next season. Can't wait to see Vardy smashing up some local pubs. Put the lawn furniture away, Vardy's in town. Vardy comes back with a tramp stamp, a gram of blow, and the match ball. Why hasn't this stat got its own thread? Martin Tyler saying the word "banter" is just not right. I've seen it all this weekend. A Stoke player doing an elastico (aka the left-foot shimmy) and now Mertesacker with an overhead. Tottenham's fitness is something else. The loudest the fans have been all day, and it's for a City player. Says a lot. The lino fucked up there. City really are relentless. A joy to watch. I have to say, I've got him tagged as a mental cunt. Sakho might be the most telegraphed passer of a ball I've ever seen. He should have been sent off, to be fair. And Rooney passing it back immediately? What a fucking disgrace. Yeah, people seemed to also intentionally go out to hurt Maradona. There was Goikoetxea (the butcher of Bilbao) who broke Maradona's leg and has the boot framed on his wall. I don't think he even got a yellow for the tackle. If someone broke Messi's leg today, it would be they who never played again. You know they changed the rule, right? Keepers used to be able to pick up the ball regardless of how it was played to them. Except he played in the era of the passback rule, something that was changed to favour the attacker. So yeah, you have no idea what you're talking about. I have to say, I'd miss Mou from the Prem if he got sacked. What a kick by Walters.
