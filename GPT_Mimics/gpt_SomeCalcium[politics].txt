As someone who works in higher education, it absolutely breaks my heart to see smart and deserving students turned away from good schools simply because it is not cost-effective for them. On the flip side, it is just as bad to see students accumulate an irresponsible amount of debt in order to attend the school of their dreams. It's a broken system, one of many, and it will only get worse under a leader who is as pragmatic as Clinton. However, the recent Democratic debates have brought up a lot of interesting points and concerns about the candidates. One of the biggest issues that has been brought up is the question of Hillary Clinton's ties to Wall Street and big banks. Clinton has been very vocal about her anti-Wall Street and anti-big bank stance, but it has been revealed that she has been paid extremely large sums of money by corporations on Wall Street to speak privately for them. This has led many voters to question whether the narrative she is spinning for the public is true, or if she is saying one thing to the public and something entirely different to these corporations. It just seems hypocritical to say one thing to one audience and potentially an entirely different thing to another audience. Who does she value more? Barring trolling, of course. To be fair, if she's up against Donald Trump in the general election, I think America is much more willing to look past a lot of this stuff. Trump's history isn't exactly stellar in terms of being a traditional conservative candidate. Although many Sanders supporters are saying that they will not vote for Clinton because she is slimy or whatever, I (and many others) feel that she still represents some of our ideals. I would vote for her in a general election for that reason if she were to win legitimately. However, if Bernie were to win the populist vote only to have Clinton turn around and win the nomination due to superdelegates, that is essentially a giant 'fuck you' to the voters. It will essentially confirm what Sanders is saying, that the political process is rigged. If that were the case, I would be staying home in November. I fear that I am not alone. This is why superdelegates can't matter. To be honest, Clinton has looked really good thus far in the debates I've seen her in. But it's really easy to look through her debate approach. Clinton has wrapped herself in the Obama mantle. Tonight her approach was, "Bernie's issues are my issues, and Obama is the best president we have ever had." Bernie threw some serious punches, and Clinton was really reeling towards the end. That being said, he had a terrible start. He just stumped and ignored the questions. The debate really changed when they started talking about economic issues and immigration. This was an older audience. Just by listening to issues they cared and didn't care about. Social Security got tons of applause and a lot of attention. They were pretty much asleep on foreign policy and immigration. Hilary had a lot more applause because she played towards the audience. She brought up problems in Wisconsin (mentioning Scott Walker a lot) throughout the entire debate. Bernie didn't bother. I don't know if they're stacked in favor of one or the other, but Hilary definitely played towards the audience. The Audience perked up with social security. They are asleep right now. It's interesting to see how the debates have played out and how the candidates have been received by different audiences. It's clear that Clinton has a strong ground campaign and has been able to rally support from a wide range of voters. However, it's also clear that Sanders has a strong following and is able to energize and inspire his supporters. One of the biggest concerns that has been raised about Clinton is her ties to Wall Street and big banks. It's understandable that voters would be concerned about this, especially given the recent financial crisis and the role that Wall Street played in it. However, it's important to remember that Clinton is not the only candidate who has received money from Wall Street and big banks. In fact, many politicians on both sides of the aisle have received money from these corporations. The question is not whether Clinton has received money from Wall Street and big banks, but whether she is willing to stand up to them and fight for the interests of the American people. It's clear that she has a strong record of fighting for social justice and equality, and has been a vocal advocate for issues like healthcare reform, women's rights, and LGBT rights. However, it's also clear that Sanders has been able to tap into a deep well of frustration and anger that many Americans feel towards the political establishment and the status quo. He has been able to inspire a new generation of voters and has been able to rally support from a wide range of voters, including young people, minorities, and working-class Americans. It's clear that both Clinton and Sanders have their strengths and weaknesses, and it's up to voters to decide which candidate they believe is best suited to lead the country forward. However, it's important to remember that the ultimate goal is to elect a candidate who is willing to fight for the interests of the American people and who is committed to creating a more just and equitable society. In the end, it's up to us as voters to decide which candidate we believe is best suited to lead the country forward. We must be willing to look past the rhetoric and the sound bites and really examine the candidates' records and their positions on the issues that matter most to us. We must be willing to engage in a thoughtful and informed debate about the future of our country and the kind of society we want to create. Ultimately, the choice is ours. We can either continue down the path of division and polarization, or we can come together as a nation and work towards a brighter and more hopeful future. The choice is ours, and it's up to us to make it.
