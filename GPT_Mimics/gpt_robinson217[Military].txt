When I first joined the reserves, I never thought I'd be in this position. I always thought that the health insurance was the best part of the deal. But now, after my daughter's accident, I'm not so sure. It all started when my wife's brother was watching our daughter at the store. He flipped the shopping cart and broke both her legs. It was a nightmare. We rushed her to the hospital and she had to have surgery on one of her legs. She's been in and out of the hospital for follow-ups and now, 10 weeks later, she's finally starting to walk with a walker. But then we got the statement from Tricare. It was over $43,000. I couldn't believe it. I had saved up for a year just to take my family to Disneyland and now I'm on the hook for this astronomical amount. And the worst part is, my wife's brother can't pay either. He's barely scraping by with a roommate and a bike to get to work. And to top it all off, he just got his girlfriend pregnant. I feel lost and helpless. I don't know what to do. I've been in the reserves for almost a year now and I'm torn about staying in. This year alone, my daughter had heart surgery and now this accident. I know I'm a quarter million dollar write-off for Tricare this year. And on top of all that, I've been gone for almost 8 weeks added up this year and that's really hard when you are running a business. I'm not sure what to do. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I want to stay in the reserves, but I don't know if I can afford it anymore. And I don't want to leave my family without health insurance. It's a tough decision. But then I remembered something my buddy and I did. We went to Applebee's on Veterans Day and each had a beer and a free steak. We left a tip equal to if we had ordered that stuff any other day. I bet they got some mooches that didn't tip well that day, so I'm guessing the girl was pretty happy to get ours. It was a small gesture, but it made me feel good. And then I thought about the Arizona memorial in Hawaii. If you only see one thing in Hawaii, I highly recommend it. It put a little damper on the mood of our honeymoon for half a day, but it was well worth it. Probably the most somber and thought-provoking memorial I've been to besides Arlington. But back to the issue at hand. I'm working with Tricare to figure this out. It's all up in the air until they see that DD2527 and decide what they want to do. I'll pm my buddy if it doesn't go my way and I need help. Thank you for your service. Seriously. I'm starting to change my views on universal health care. At first, I was worried that it might stifle progress. Without a profit incentive, why cure diseases? But now I'm seeing how fast this is spinning out of control. I had my appendix out years ago in an emergency surgery with a 5-day hospital stay. The whole bill was $8,000 and my insurance covered $7,900 of it. Now my daughter was in the hospital for 2 days with emergency surgery and it was $43,000. Not sustainable. I'm also starting to see how unfair the system can be. My wife's brother caused the accident, but I'm the one who has to pay for it. It's not right. And I never received anything asking me to fill out that form. I only got a notice saying they reserved the right to go after any third parties that may or may not be involved. It looked like a form letter that was generated because the injury was listed as "accident". Making sure they get this form now will be a focus of my call. But what about my wife's brother and the store? No one ever asked us about them. I fully expected to be interviewed by some kind of social worker or law enforcement when my kid had two broken legs, but it never happened. I also never informed Costco this happened. It happened outside and my wife rushed my daughter to the first hospital when it happened. She was then transported to the children's hospital. I guess my next step is to call and ask about DD 2527. I'm hoping they'll go after my wife's brother or possibly Costco. But I'm not holding my breath. It's a waiting game now. In the meantime, I'll keep pushing forward. I'll keep working hard and trying to provide for my family. And I'll keep hoping that things will work out in the end. Because that's all I can do.
