Is it only for the scientist? I haven't tried putting it on any other class. These symbols are on the ceiling in the golden gnome room in the sewers. How is that at all relevant to this thread other than for the sake of being a dick? Idk. It's the very last mission you do before the Infinity mission. The Hypno Flower coffee one. Buy it. People saying wait for the rose to be fixed are forgetting there's WAY more than just MP. I already have like 12 hours and I haven't even touched MP. Z7 Imp was already confirmed that you can unlock it normally. It is just an early unlock. Yeh, I had a super commando that was useless, but I have a zoologist and a z7 imp that were always by my side. I was a golf star because I wanted a ton of health(because those two went down like 50 times). It got really close at one point where I had like 4 health and everyone was down. What makes it easier is they don't have a revive timer and can be revived at any time.  I don't know what exactly triggers it, but there's a phone near the buildings by the dock that will start ringing. It's gnomes talking about letting you join their organization. They'll say they aren't sure yet and hang up and that's it. I eventually went back(and coincidentally found more golden gnomes) and saw that I could pick it up again. They said they'd decided to let me join and told me to pick up the key to their lair. The key is a gnome bomb on the docks. To use the key, you need to go to the sewers and place it by a large grate(forgot exactly where it is, it's like under the "under construction, for sale" tapped off thing). Once you set that down, it explodes and lets you into a huge cave. You can see the rest from there. :D  It is. I'm like 99% certain you can upgrade to Deluxe afterwards. And for that, you have all the time in the world. Even if the Unicorn Chomper will be out for a year, that's still a shitload of work. But how much time it takes is irrelevant to the conversation. People are also rightfully upset the unicorn chomper has a unique ability. How could you not see the comparison and how it's the same. It's anti-consumer. People who don't have the extra money for the deluxe edition or don't have the money AND time to get the unicorn chomper are shit out of luck and that's bullshit. Maybe if the ability wasn't unique to the chomper, I wouldn't care as much. I don't care if I never use the chomper anyways, I at least want the ability to have that ability so if I ever want to, I'm not at a disadvantage.  9/10 times if it's a multiplayer game, those are just keys to unlock the content. The reason why this is how it is, is that all that stuff is server-side already(saying you've unlocked it). Everybody has it installed already. Oh my gosh, this is amazing. Wish I could get through Season 9. This is why I had a problem with Unicorn chomper. I got the deluxe edition, but I still think it's bs. Edit: Love people downvoting me. As if it's not exactly the same? If it's permanently exclusive, it's anti-consumer.  Where do you get the quest? They're installed with the game? Pretty sure there was a thread like a week or so ago asking how old everyone was and most people were over 18 lmao. Doubt many kids even use Reddit. I taunt super commandos because they deserve it. I went 46-0 once and I felt kinda bad. I love all those randomly generated Xbox names hahahaha. Played a shitload of the original PvZ, didn't like the 2nd one too much as it was super P2W. Saw GW get announced but couldn't play it because it was exclusive to Xbox at the time. Was pretty bummed and thought I'd never get to play it. Then it came to PS4 and I've been playing it since. Ayyyy  Pretty sure using a VPN to buy games cheaper in another country is illegal, but I could be wrong. Where can you see character changes? I only taunt Super Commandos cuz they're trash. Pre-order now and get immediate access to the new Grass Effect Z7 Mech when you start the game They never said it was exclusive. They've mentioned exclusive rewards, but never outright called it exclusive. Yeh, but they've mentioned multiples times everyone could get it, and they also let people use it in the beta. Wouldn't make sense if it was exclusive to preorders.  You now me on smoke nice. Can you make it so we can see the scoreboard while dead/waiting to respawn? Edit: Can you also revert overtime back to the way it was in GW1? What's more infuriating and depressing than the entire variant alone is how callous and cold the people of this sub are. You know I'm not using the word literally. Having a vendetta against me for voicing a different opinion is childish and petty.  ITT: People already 313 seeing nothing wrong with it because they got it already. People defending this shit are retarded. He paid full price for a game. Expecting him to buy another game and waste time and money for it is fucking stupid. Being expected to pay for a game with content that you can't even access is an awful practice and anyone defending this is crazy.  That's why I said they should make a Stream build. Did you read my second sentence? :l Yeh, but they can still control what gets seen or is accessible. :P At least like making a stream build to make sure nothing gets seen early. What the hell are you talking about? Troll? Free handout? Dude, there's no need for such childish insults. I'm sorry I disagree with your opinion? If you actually think you have a case over them releasing DLC they "promised" would be exclusive, then good fucking luck. Can you actually name a situation where a game company was sued and had to successfully pay out? Civil lawsuit lmao wat. It's their game. They can do whatever the fuck they want. Promises don't mean jack shit. They didn't sign a contract saying they aren't allowed to give it out. It would get thrown out of court before you even walked up the steps.  Exactly. None of them have any sympathy for people who actually have real-life obligations or have a budget. I'd rather not be punished for being unable to spend every waking minute on this game. Exclusives are not always permanent, a la DLC for Call of Duty or the DLC for Destiny. Yeh, you may be alienating the older players by doing that, but you're also alienating brand new players as well. What do you think the percentage is for players that won't have the chomper? Probably very, very low. Asking players to buy GW1 AND spend money or time on a game that odds are is probably going to be pretty dead by the time GW2 comes out is insane. They even said that around 50% of ALL players in the beta hadn't even played GW1! That's a fuckton of people.  There's no need to be an asshole about it. Being high and mighty is a bit juvenile. The point I'm making isn't just in regards to me being unable to get it due to time, but for new players that have never played the franchise. Ya'll are taking this "status symbol" way too fucking seriously. Also, I should clarify yet again, I'm not saying it's instantly unlocked(therefore not instant gratification), but having the ability to be unlocked.  In conclusion, the issue of exclusive content in games is a contentious one. While some argue that it is a fair reward for dedicated players or those willing to spend extra money, others see it as anti-consumer and unfair to those who cannot afford or do not have the time to obtain it. It is important for game developers to consider the impact of their decisions on all players, both new and old, and to strive for a fair and balanced gaming experience.
