Let's talk about the concept of "free" in the world of subscription services. Specifically, let's talk about PlayStation Plus and the monthly games that come with it. First of all, let's establish that PlayStation Plus is not a free service. It is a paid subscription service that gives you access to online multiplayer, discounts on games, and, yes, monthly games. You pay for the service, and in return, you get these benefits. So, in that sense, the games are not "free" - they are part of the package you are paying for. However, that doesn't mean the games have no value. In fact, they are a major selling point of the service. Many people subscribe to PlayStation Plus specifically for the monthly games, and if Sony were to stop offering them, it would be a significant blow to the service's value proposition. So, while the games are not technically free, they are still a valuable part of the service. And that's where things get a little tricky when it comes to the concept of "free." You see, when we talk about something being "free," we usually mean that it has no monetary cost. But there are other ways to assign value to things besides money. For example, time is a valuable resource, and we often talk about things being "free" in terms of the time they save us. If I download a free app that helps me organize my schedule, I might say that it's "free" because it saves me the time and effort of trying to do it manually. Similarly, we can assign value to things based on their opportunity cost - that is, what we would have to give up in order to get them. For example, if I get a "buy one, get one free" deal on a pair of shoes, I might say that the second pair is "free" because I would have had to pay for it if I had bought the shoes separately. So, when we talk about the monthly games that come with PlayStation Plus, we have to consider their value in terms of both money and opportunity cost. Yes, you are paying for the service, and the games are technically part of that package. But if you were to buy those games separately, you would have to pay full price for them. So, in that sense, they are "free" in that they save you money. Furthermore, the opportunity cost of the games is not insignificant. If you are a PlayStation Plus subscriber, you are essentially committing to playing the monthly games in order to get the most value out of your subscription. That means you might be less likely to buy other games that you might have otherwise purchased. So, in that sense, the games are "free" in that they save you the opportunity cost of having to choose between them and other games. Of course, all of this is somewhat semantic. The fact remains that you are paying for PlayStation Plus, and the monthly games are part of that package. But I think it's important to recognize that there are different ways to assign value to things, and that the concept of "free" is not always as straightforward as it seems. Now, let's talk about the value of the monthly games themselves. Are they worth the price of admission to PlayStation Plus? The answer, of course, depends on your personal preferences and gaming habits. But I would argue that, for most people, the monthly games are a great value. First of all, the games are often high-quality titles that have been well-received by critics and players alike. For example, recent offerings have included games like Control, Shadow of the Colossus, and Fall Guys - all of which are excellent games that would be worth buying on their own. Secondly, the games are often relatively new releases. While you might not get the latest and greatest games every month, you can usually expect to see titles that are only a few months old. This means that you are getting access to games that are still very much in demand, and that you might not have been able to afford otherwise. Finally, the games are yours to keep as long as you remain a PlayStation Plus subscriber. This means that even if you cancel your subscription, you can still play the games you've downloaded. This is a significant advantage over other subscription services, like Xbox Game Pass, which require you to maintain an active subscription in order to access the games. All of these factors combine to make the monthly games a great value for most gamers. Of course, there will always be people who don't care about the games, or who already own them, or who simply don't have time to play them. But for the vast majority of PlayStation Plus subscribers, the monthly games are a major selling point of the service. So, to sum up: the monthly games that come with PlayStation Plus are not technically "free," but they are still a valuable part of the service. They save you money and opportunity cost, and they are often high-quality titles that are relatively new. If you are a gamer who enjoys trying out new games and doesn't mind committing to playing them, then PlayStation Plus is definitely worth the price of admission.
