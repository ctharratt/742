Hey guys, anyone know where I can still find a cheap vz? Or did I miss the boat on that one? I mean, I know it's not the most popular gun out there, but I've always had a soft spot for it. And while we're on the topic, have any of you used the magazine grip sleeve? I heard that not using it and gripping against the magazine can cause some issues. Just something to keep in mind. So, I ordered a BCG from AIM back on August 9th and it still hasn't arrived. I'm getting a refund now, but I need to find a new one. Any suggestions for a budget BCG that ships fast? I know it's a tall order, but I'm hoping someone out there has some ideas. And speaking of budget items, have you guys seen the prices on ARs lately? They're rock bottom right now. I'm thinking about picking one up for apartment defense and range use. Any recommendations on what to get to make it a decent first AR? I'm still missing the BCG and charging handle, but I have a PSA Midlength Freedom upper and a blemished lower. Just need to fill in the gaps. Oh, and speaking of PSA, has anyone else had issues with their orders? I ordered some ammo and a magazine from them on August 9th as well and still haven't received them. AIM had an issue with UPS Surepost and PSA still hasn't figured out why I didn't get tracking info or where my package went. It's frustrating to have paid $150 for stuff and have nothing to show for it. But let's switch gears for a minute. Have any of you tried using a surplus AK or Mosin sling on an AR? I'm curious to see if it's possible and how it would work. And while we're on the topic of guns, has anyone else heard about the Beretta clones? Apparently, their clones are fine, but their original designs are messed up. Tapco rule in full effect, am I right? But let's not forget about the importance of gun safety. I think we should all treat our guns less like "things" and more like tools. Start by filling in roles with your guns. Do you own a shotgun yet? How about a pistol? Everyone that owns guns is different, so find what works best for you. And speaking of finding what works best, has anyone tried out the Troy sling? Is it objectively better than the Magpul ones? And where can I find a good charging handle? But let's not forget about the bigger picture. Have any of you heard about the federal authorization for gun ownership? How many people are actually authorized? It's an interesting topic to think about. And while we're on the topic of bigger pictures, have any of you heard about the Milsurp joke match? Is there a round count limit? I have a whole spam can and a week to kill, so I'm curious to see if it's possible. But let's not forget about the importance of gun maintenance. How bad are PTAC uppers from PSA? Can someone explain the difference to me as someone who's putting together their first AR? And speaking of gun maintenance, has anyone else had issues with their holster? Make sure the trigger isn't exposed when you receive it. Safety first, guys. But let's not forget about the importance of gun control. I know it's a touchy subject, but we need to have an open dialogue about it. And let's not forget that Rand and Ron Paul are two different people with two different stances on some things. But let's not forget about the importance of having fun with guns. Have any of you played the game Black? It has some pretty guns in it. And speaking of having fun, has anyone tried out the PS90? It's definitely doable, but why would you unless you had to? Safety first, guys. But let's not forget about the importance of gun rights. It's frustrating to see some sheriffs publicly stating their opposition to gun rights and refusing to enforce them. We need to stand up for our rights and make our voices heard. And speaking of making our voices heard, has anyone heard about the idea of passing out guns to everyone in the ghetto? It's a ridiculous idea and a complete strawman argument. Let's focus on real solutions to real problems. In conclusion, there are a lot of different topics to think about when it comes to guns. From finding the right BCG to discussing gun control, there's always something to talk about. But let's not forget about the importance of safety, maintenance, and having fun. Let's keep the conversation going and make sure our voices are heard.
