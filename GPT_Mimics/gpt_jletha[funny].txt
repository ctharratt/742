Used to install flooring, ours was a blue carpet wrench. It was always a game of hide and seek to find it in the truck. I remember spending hours searching for it, only to find it tucked away in a corner. But that was just part of the job, the thrill of the hunt. Speaking of hunts, have you ever heard of Crosby Field? It's a historic baseball stadium located in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was home to the Cincinnati Reds from 1912 to 1970 and was known for its unique features, including a hill in center field. And let's not forget about Yankee Stadium's Monument Park, which used to be in play. It's amazing to think about the history and stories that these stadiums hold. But let's switch gears and talk about Halloween costumes. Have you ever seen a costume that was so obscure, only a select few would understand it? That's what I think of when someone says "actually good costumes." It's not about being flashy or trendy, it's about making a reference that only a few people will get. It's like a secret club, and if you understand the reference, you're in. Speaking of secrets, have you ever wondered if a professional athlete is using performance-enhancing drugs? It's a question that has plagued sports for years. But when it comes to running, I believe that some athletes are just naturally gifted. Take Usain Bolt, for example. He's been tested more than any other runner over the last many years, and I think his runs are clean. Or maybe he's just way better at hiding it than anyone else. Switching gears again, let's talk about being a scientist. I had a professor who really tried to train us to be good scientists instead of using us for cheap labor. She encouraged us to take time off and often would call up the lab and tell us to take off because it was such a nice day out. She treated us like adults, which isn't always the case in academia. It was refreshing to have someone who cared about our well-being and wanted us to learn and grow as scientists. And speaking of learning and growing, have you ever thought about how technology has changed the way we live our lives? It's incredible to think about how much has changed in just a few decades. When I was a kid, I had separate pieces of equipment for books, games, and learning math. Now, it's all in one device. It's like having earth life in a can, ready to be opened at any moment. But with all this technology, it's important to remember that it's not a replacement for human interaction. I've never been in a live-together relationship, but I can imagine that it's an incredible experience. What a world they will have grown up with, with all the latest technology available to them for the majority of their lives. Nobody should feel bad for a generation that gets to use the latest technology. It's just a different way of living. And speaking of living, let's talk about career paths. As an engineering PhD student, I'm always thinking about what my next step will be. My top goal is to find a job that pays well while giving me plenty of time off to enjoy myself. National Labs are my dream job, and I'm excited to see where my career takes me. But with all this talk of work and technology, it's important to remember to take time for ourselves. We can't be productive all the time, and it's okay to take a break and enjoy the little things in life. Like a cup of coffee from Pike Place, or a cold beer after a long day of work. In the end, it's all about balance. Balancing work and play, technology and human interaction, and everything in between. Life is a journey, and it's up to us to make the most of it. So let's enjoy the ride and see where it takes us.
