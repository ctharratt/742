The NFL has been plagued with controversy in recent years, from domestic violence scandals to accusations of performance-enhancing drug use. But one issue that has been particularly frustrating for fans and players alike is the on-field review process. Currently, reviews are handled by officials on the field, who must physically go to a booth to watch replays and make a decision. This process is slow, often inaccurate, and can disrupt the flow of the game. It's time for a change. Instead, all reviews should be handled by a replay official(s) in a booth. This would increase the accuracy of reviews while cutting the average review time down to 15 seconds. Even an 18-year-old with an Xbox controller and multiple monitors could do a better job than the current system. The current process of watching geriatrics limp over to the sideline to review plays in a booth, just to get them wrong 50% of the time, needs to end. It's time for the NFL to embrace technology and make the necessary changes to improve the game. But the on-field review process is just one of many issues facing the NFL. Another issue is the way players are treated and compensated. The players are the ones with talent, yet they are often treated as disposable commodities. Any idiot with a billion dollars and an antitrust exemption could own a team, but it takes real skill and dedication to be a successful player. Players deserve better treatment and compensation. They should have more say in the league and be given a greater share of the profits. After all, without the players, there would be no NFL. But even the most talented players can fall from grace. Take Joe Flacco, for example. He was once considered one of the best quarterbacks in the league, but now he's struggling to find a team willing to take a chance on him. I could see him getting $2.5 million for one year, plus incentives with an option for a second year. But I doubt anyone would be willing to risk more than $2.5 million guaranteed on this dude. He's worth a shot at the minimum. But he'll never get back to what he was three years ago, and probably nowhere even close. And then there's the issue of scandals. The NFL has been rocked by scandals in recent years, from Deflategate to HGHgate to Taintgate. But perhaps the most disturbing scandal of all is the one involving Peyton Manning. Sworn testimony from one of Manning's teammates suggests that he may have been involved in a cover-up of a sexual assault incident that occurred while he was in college. This is a serious allegation, and one that should not be taken lightly. The federal judge in the case has to take more into consideration than just the victim's wishes. The victims' wishes are probably being taken into consideration: 1.) A plea deal will allow the victims to avoid having to go through the torture of testifying and having their personal lives torn apart in the media. 2.) The victims probably want all the money he has left going to them, and not his lawyers for a trial. 3.) The guilty plea guarantees he goes to jail and makes civil litigation much easier. But regardless of the outcome of the Manning case, it's clear that the NFL has a serious problem with violence and abuse. It's time for the league to take a hard look at itself and make the necessary changes to ensure that players are held accountable for their actions and that victims are given the support they need. And while we're at it, let's talk about the state of the game itself. Football is a violent sport, and it's not for everyone. But that doesn't mean we should accept violence and abuse as a normal part of the game. Football encourages and glorifies a ritualized form of violence, and it's time for the NFL to take responsibility for the impact that this has on players and society as a whole. We need to find ways to make the game safer and more enjoyable for everyone involved. One way to do this is to crack down on dirty play. Both offensive and defensive players are guilty of holding, tripping, and other forms of cheating. This not only puts players at risk of injury, but it also detracts from the integrity of the game. Another way to make the game safer is to improve the equipment. Helmets and pads have come a long way in recent years, but there is still room for improvement. We need to invest in research and development to create equipment that is both effective and comfortable for players. Finally, we need to address the issue of concussions. Concussions are a serious problem in football, and they can have long-term effects on players' health and well-being. We need to find ways to prevent concussions from occurring in the first place, and we need to provide better support and care for players who do suffer from them. In conclusion, the NFL has a lot of work to do if it wants to remain a viable and respected institution. From improving the on-field review process to addressing issues of violence and abuse, there are many challenges facing the league. But with the right leadership and a commitment to change, the NFL can overcome these challenges and continue to provide fans with the exciting and entertaining football they love. It's time for the NFL to step up and do what's right for the players, the fans, and the game itself.
