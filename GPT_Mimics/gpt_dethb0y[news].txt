The issue of government oppression and the lack of accountability for offending guards in prisons is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. It's clear that until there is motivation for the prison system to actually punish those who abuse their power, the situation will not change. This lack of accountability is not limited to the prison system, as we see with the endemic welfare fraud that goes unpunished unless someone with the law behind them takes action. It's frustrating to see the government turn a blind eye to these issues and instead use their power to oppress certain social groups. Legalization of certain practices, such as plural marriage, may not solve all problems instantly, but it would be a step in the right direction. The issue of underage marriages could also be better addressed if plural marriages were legal, as it would be easier to enforce the law on these matters. However, it's important to note that if there is a problem with underage marriages, those involved should be arrested and put on trial like anyone else who marries a minor. It's not fair to allow certain groups to break the law without consequences. The issue of church leadership living well off the flock is not limited to one specific group, as many churches have similar goals. However, it's important to recognize that there are larger and more offensive targets near at hand, such as the vast church of Latter Day Saints. It's also important to consider the constant law enforcement harassment that certain groups face, which makes it difficult for them to better themselves and their communities. It's concerning to see the government use their power to enforce their bigotry and distaste for certain social groups. Instead, we should be leaving people alone to live their lives without fear of oppression. If we want to fix the SNAP problem, legalizing plural marriage could be a solution. However, it's important to educate people about the risks of having children over the age of 40, as the odds of having a child with Down syndrome increase significantly. The issue of the government harassing certain groups, such as the Amish, is a problem that needs to be addressed. It's not fair to target specific groups and ignore the larger issues at hand. We should be focusing on solutions that benefit everyone, rather than using our power to oppress certain groups. The recent case of the shanty towns on a bridge overpasses is a strange one, and it's clear that the local government cannot simply turn a blind eye to the issue. However, it's important to consider the root causes of the problem and address them in a way that benefits everyone involved. Busting people for child abuse, rather than trumped-up paperwork charges, would be a more effective solution. The issue of random shootings is a difficult one for law enforcement to interdict, as the shooter moves around from place to place. However, it's important to recognize that every disaster is not one thing going wrong, but a series of things going wrong in a precise sequence. At any point, the situation could have been averted, but it wasn't. It's important to learn from these situations and work towards preventing them in the future. The issue of school administrators not looking into offenses is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. It's clear that they have little motivation to do so, and this needs to change. If someone is being abused, it's important to report it to the authorities and press charges, as this will force the school to take action. The issue of hiring practices is also a problem, as many companies use the excuse of needing more experience to justify hiring the person they wanted all along. It's important to recognize this and work towards creating a fair and just hiring process. In conclusion, the issue of government oppression and lack of accountability is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. It's important to recognize the root causes of these issues and work towards solutions that benefit everyone involved. We should be leaving people alone to live their lives without fear of oppression, and working towards creating a fair and just society for all.
