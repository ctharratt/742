Alright, let's talk about something that's been on my mind lately - the ridiculousness of the service animal trend on flights. Look, I get it, some people legitimately need a service animal for medical reasons. But let's be real, there are way too many people out there abusing the system and bringing their pets on flights claiming they're service animals when they're really just their emotional support animals. And it's not just dogs, I've heard of people bringing cats, snakes, and even miniature horses on flights claiming they're service animals. Give me a break. First of all, let's talk about the safety concerns. I don't care how well-behaved your dog is, it's still an animal and it can still act unpredictably. I've heard stories of dogs biting other passengers or even getting into fights with other dogs on flights. And what if someone on the flight is allergic to dogs? It's not fair to subject them to potential health risks just because you want to bring your pet on a flight. Secondly, let's talk about the inconvenience factor. I mean, have you ever been on a flight where there's a dog barking or whining the entire time? It's not exactly a pleasant experience. And what if the dog has to go to the bathroom? Are you really going to let it do its business in the aisle? Gross. And let's not forget about the fact that it's just plain unfair to other passengers. I mean, if you're allergic to dogs or just don't like them, tough luck. You're stuck on a flight with nowhere to go and no way to escape the barking or the smell. And what about the people who paid extra for a seat with extra legroom or a window seat, only to be moved because someone with a service animal needs that seat? It's not fair to them either. Now, I know some people are going to argue that they need their service animal with them for medical reasons. And like I said earlier, I get that. But here's the thing - there are other ways to accommodate those needs without subjecting other passengers to potential health risks or inconvenience. For example, if you have a panic disorder, there are medications you can take to help you stay calm during a flight. If you have epilepsy, there are devices you can wear that will alert you if you're about to have a seizure. And if you're blind, well, obviously you need a guide dog. But for everyone else, there's really no excuse. So what's the solution? Well, in my opinion, all pets should be stored below deck during flights and returned to their owners when they land. It's not like they're running free in the underside of the plane while in transit. They're secured in those travel boxes for pets. And if you really need your service animal with you during the flight, there should be some kind of identification card or certification process to prove that you actually need it. That way, we can weed out the people who are just trying to bring their pets on flights for fun. Look, I'm not trying to be a hater here. I love dogs as much as the next person. But there's a time and a place for everything, and a crowded airplane is not the place for your furry friend. Let's all be considerate of our fellow passengers and leave the pets at home (or in cargo) during flights.
