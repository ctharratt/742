I have to say, I'm pretty excited about the upcoming Star Wars comics published by Marvel. I can see it happening, and I think it's going to be a great way to expand the Star Wars universe even further. I mean, who doesn't want more Star Wars in their life? But I have to admit, sometimes I get confused by all these MacFarlane boys. Seth Todd McFarlane recently announced that the Spawn script was ready, and it seems like he's definitely going with the Deadpool trend. I mean, who can blame him? Deadpool was a huge success, and it's clear that audiences are hungry for more R-rated superhero movies. Speaking of R-rated superhero movies, have you seen the trailer for the upcoming Netflix series about a group of heroes with insanely swollen chests that defy physics? It looks pretty ridiculous, but I have to admit, I'm kind of intrigued. And who knows, maybe they'll eventually bring in someone like Seth Todd McFarlane as a creative consultant for the Unbelievable Pouch-Man movie. Hey, it could happen. But let's talk about something a little more serious for a moment. I recently saw some artwork by Rob Liefield, and I have to say, it's not looking great. I mean, seriously, have you seen the right katana handle? It looks terrible. I'm just glad to hear that he's not involved in the upcoming Deadpool movie, because I don't think I could handle any more of his shitty tracing. Speaking of the Deadpool movie, I'm really hoping they don't treat him like a clown the whole time. I mean, sure, he's known for his crude jokes and irreverent humor, but there's also a tragic backstory there that deserves to be explored. I don't want to see Ryan Reynolds' penis if he doesn't suffer in life, you know what I mean? And while we're on the subject of movies, can we talk about Halloweentown for a minute? That movie was seriously underrated. I always thought people looked down on Disney Channel movies like they were meaningless and shallow, but Halloweentown had some real heart to it. And apparently, it's still getting a lot of love after nearly 20 years. Who knew? Of course, not all movies are created equal. I recently watched Wayward Pines, and I have to say, it was a bit of a mess. I was enjoying it at first, but then it went downhill fast. And don't even get me started on Ben. Fuck that guy. But let's end on a positive note. I recently read The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, and I have to say, it's one of the best Deadpool comics I've ever read. Unlike some other writers (*cough* Daniel Way *cough*), Posehn and Duggan really understand the character and his past. They know that he's not just a clown, but a tragic hero who wears insanity as a mask to hide his true self. And you know what? I think that's what we all want to see on screen. We want to see the real Deadpool, the one who's been through so much in his life and uses humor as a coping mechanism. We don't want to see a watered-down version of the character who's just there to make us laugh. So here's hoping that the upcoming Deadpool movie lives up to our expectations. And if it doesn't, well, at least we'll always have Halloweentown.
