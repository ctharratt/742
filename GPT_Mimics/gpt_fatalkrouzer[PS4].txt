Oh man, Goosebumps! That brings back so many memories. I used to read those books all the time when I was a kid. And now they've made a movie and a game? That's so cool! I haven't seen the movie yet, but I've heard it's doing really well on Rotten Tomatoes. I mean, it's not like they could keep the same feel and comedy as the 90s show, right? They have to appeal to the new generation too. But from what I've heard, they've done a good job of keeping the monsters true to the original series. And speaking of the game, I just finished playing it. It's a point and click adventure, just like those old PC games. It's not going to appeal to everyone, but if you're a fan of the series, it's definitely worth checking out. It's challenging at some points, and there are multiple ways to complete puzzles, which I really appreciate. It really makes you use your brain, you know? I bought the digital version of the game, but I really wish there was a disc version. I've been looking for it at Gamestop here in Canada, but I can't seem to find it. I even checked the Sweden website, but it wasn't listed there either. Does anyone have a link to where I can buy the disc version? Anyway, back to the game. I beat it twice already, and I'm planning on doing a speed run tomorrow. The game can be beaten in an hour, but it's definitely more fun to take your time and explore all the different options. The only issue I have is that some of the trophies are really hard to get, and there's no guide or walkthrough out yet. So I'm unlocking everything on my own and making my own guide as I go. It's a bit of a challenge, but I'm up for it! Overall, I think the game is a great way to relive some of those Goosebumps memories. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth the $14 price tag. And if you're a fan of the series, I'm pretty sure you'll appreciate the game just as much as I did. Now, about that movie. I really want to see it, but I haven't had the chance yet. I've heard that the Goosebumps theme is in the movie, but it's slowed down. That's kind of a bummer, but I guess it makes sense for the movie. I mean, they have to change things up a bit, right? I'm just happy to see Goosebumps revived and on the big screen. It's been so long since I've seen anything Goosebumps-related, and it's great to see it getting some love again. I mean, I know it's cheesy and all, but that's part of the charm, you know? It was cheesy in the 90s, and it's cheesy now, but that's what makes it so fun. Anyway, I'm rambling now. I just really love Goosebumps, and I'm so glad that it's back in the spotlight. I can't wait to see what they do with it next. Maybe they'll make a new TV show or something? That would be awesome. But for now, I'm just going to keep playing the game and waiting for the movie to come out on DVD. And if anyone knows where I can find the disc version of the game, please let me know!
