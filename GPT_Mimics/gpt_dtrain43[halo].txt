My fellow gamers, let's talk about Halo 5. Specifically, let's talk about the multiplayer experience and all the little quirks and strategies that make it so addictive. First off, let's talk about the AI Kills gambit. This little trick can net you a whopping 15k exp, but where did it come from? I have no idea. But what I do know is that it's a great way to tactically fly a Banshee without running into a killbox every 10 seconds. It's a lazy way to level up, sure, but it's effective. Now, let's address the issue of forcing people to play the MCC just for convenience. I mean, come on, 343, do you really expect us to suddenly switch over to a different game just because it's more convenient for you? That's not how it works. We play Halo 5 because we love it, not because we're forced to. Speaking of lazy tactics, let's talk about fighting Warden Eternal twice. It's like the campaign all over again. Sure, it's a challenge, but it's also repetitive and boring. Can't we mix it up a little bit? And while we're at it, can we please stop with the constant "look guise I got a prophet's bane out of a pack" posts? We get it, you're lucky. Move on. But let's focus on the positives, shall we? The Speed Booster is a game-changer, giving you a jump boost that can really come in handy. And if you're having trouble finding the most popular games on the Xbox store, just look for the category called Most Popular or something like that. It's not rocket science. And speaking of rockets, let's talk about Scatty Binaries and Swordy Beams. Can Scatty Binaries really not melt Swordy Beams? I'm not sure, but I do know that Fall of Reach was an inside job. And if you're experiencing perferection that lasts longer than 4 hours, call a doctor. Trust me on this one. Moving on, let's talk about the Destiny community's reaction to that infamous interview. Holy shit, what a disaster. Every post was DAE FUCK LUKE SMITH ASS AS A HAT AND ALSO FUCK LUKE SMITH!?!???!!. It was a mess, but at least we can all agree that it was a trainwreck. And let's not forget about the most useful bot ever. Seriously, that thing is a lifesaver. And if you're feeling burnt out on Halo 5, why not try something new? It's not like we're forcing you to play it. Now, let's talk about some gameplay tips and tricks. Once you have the lock on, you can just hip-fire. And if you're shooting at an enemy that is boarding a friendly Scorpion, you can get a Scorpion Destroy assist if the enemy destroys the Scorpion. But can vehicles in limbo take friendly damage? That's a question for the ages. And let's not forget about those dirty little secrets in Warzone. They're like needlers, but even more deadly. And if you're itching to play more Warzone, you may want to see a doctor. Just saying. But let's be real here, not all of us are good at Halo 5. I mean, I never claimed to be good. I just said I was better than that guy in the video. And don't even get me started on the competitive quitting playlist. It's a nightmare. But what if we had a playlist where Yugi assembles the 5 cards- Fuel Rod Cannon, Whiplash, Oni Warthog, Scorpion, and Wraith to summon Warzone Blowout-odia? Now that would be something. And let's not forget about the joys of longshotting people from Garage, Spire, etc. when you're 100 points from victory. It's a rush, but it's also frustrating when you can only use the gold pack reqs once every 10~ games. Come on, 343, give us a break. And speaking of breaks, let's take a moment to appreciate the best servers in a competitive multiplayer game, hands-down. Lag is a rarity in Halo 5, and that's something to be thankful for. But let's not forget about the little things, like the fact that the AR was a tickle machine until now. And let's not forget about the joy of getting a energy bayonet Battle Rifle out of a silver pack, even if you rarely get to use it. And let's not forget about the differences between Halo 5 and Destiny. They're completely different games, but I do like Halo 5's multiplayer more than Destiny's. And let's not forget about 343's weekly updates, which are so much better than Bungie's "who knows what players may find in the coming weeks" bullshit. But let's not forget about the funniest moments in Halo 5, like when Linda runs in a straight line to where your body is and does nothing about the sword zealot standing above it. Or when you armor lock right before someone tries to splatter you. Good times. In conclusion, Halo 5 is a game full of quirks and strategies that make it addictive and fun. Sure, there are some lazy tactics and repetitive challenges, but there are also moments of pure joy and excitement. So let's keep playing, keep exploring, and keep having fun.
