Hey there, folks! I gotta say, I'm really excited about the upcoming MMA/UFC fights. But before we get into that, can we just take a moment to appreciate the kind-heartedness of our fellow fans? I mean, seriously, it's so important to make sure that the winner of any ticket giveaway actually belongs in the MMA/UFC categories and has contributed to the community. We don't want some random internet bum who doesn't even know what UFC is to win and just sell the ticket to someone else. That's just not fair. Speaking of fairness, can we talk about the recent fights? I gotta say, that guy who cried for like 30 minutes after he lost showed all heart. He deserves his redemption fight, don't you think? And let's not forget about Aldo and Edgar. They've both put in the work and deserve their shot. I know some people only care about the UFC post-Conor effect, but we can't forget about the other fighters who have worked just as hard. Now, let's talk about some of the drama that's been going on. I mean, what's up with RDA wasting all that money and then breaking his own leg to escape the fight? That's just not cool. Conor loves his Irish fans, but now he's forced into a fight he doesn't want to do and there's even a chance he could get injured and throw off his career. RDA should be stripped of the belt and Conor should fight someone in the top 5 for it. It's only fair. And what's with all the scum pulling out and hurting themselves? It's just not right. We need fighters who are willing to put in the work and actually fight. I say kick RDA from his title and let someone available in the top 5 fight for it (again) with Conor. It's time to get serious about this. But let's not forget about the fans. I was planning to buy the PPV, but there's just so much up in the air right now. I hope they do something soon because they're just going to give Conor an easy fight so he can fight in 200. And what's with all the haters out there? They don't even realize that this sub is for actual skillful fighting, not scripted rednecks and actors performing stunts. The fights here aren't predetermined either. Take it to the movie section where all the scripted action movies belong. And can we talk about the music? Aqua's "Barbie Girl" is a classic, but I'm not sure it's the best choice for a fight. It might lure your opposition into a false sense of security before you take them down, but I don't think it's the best strategy. And let's not forget about Lyoto. He was good in the day, but he's just not the same anymore. Sparring with him might be a bad choice for RDA. He's going to get comfortable on those slow swings and then get fkd up in the ring. But let's end on a positive note. That video someone shared was really good. It's nice to see people sharing things that actually matter. And let's not forget about the Icelandic fighter. She's a great person and a great fighter, but sexually attractive? Heck naw. And sure, she might be slow compared to Conor, but that doesn't mean she's the worst. Let's give credit where credit is due. In conclusion, let's make sure we're supporting the fighters who deserve it and not just the ones who are popular. Let's hold them accountable for their actions and make sure they're actually putting in the work. And let's not forget about the music. It might not be the most important thing, but it can definitely set the tone for a fight. Thanks for listening, folks!
