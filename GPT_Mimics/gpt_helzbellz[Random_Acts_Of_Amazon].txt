Hey there! I'm so excited to be here and share my thoughts with you all. I just started a new job as a security guard/soon to be CCTV operator at the local bus station. It's been a few days and I'm already loving it. The control room I'll be in does all the CCTV in our town, and let me tell you, it's like something out of a movie. All brand new and high tech, it's just awesome! I'm a bit of a nosy person, so I love being able to watch all the cameras and see what's going on around town. Speaking of which, did you know that our town has one of the largest amounts of cameras per square mile in the UK? I'm not sure how many there are exactly, but it's pretty impressive. One thing I've noticed since starting this job is how crazy some people can be. We get all sorts of characters passing through the bus station, and my colleagues love sharing their stories. My supervisor even said he's going to write a book about it! One thing that shocked me the most was the amount of gay sex that goes on in the toilets, usually for money. Madness! As for my appearance, I've been having a bit of trouble with my makeup melting off my face in the warm control room. I would love to try out this tinted moisturizer I found for only £1.99 (less than $4!). The RRP is like £22, so it's a total bargain. Happy payday to those of you who have it, I have to wait until next Thursday. Magic numbers, am I right? In terms of my career aspirations, I've always been interested in criminal psychology. It's just so fascinating to me. Right now, I'm just taking this security job as a way to gain experience working with individuals who like to push boundaries and rules. It's also a good way to make some money and save up for the future. I've been volunteering for probation too, but I might have to stop now that I've started this full-time job. It's a shame because I really loved it. Ideally, I would love to be a prison officer, but recruitment isn't happening as often as I'd like due to the privatization of many UK prisons. Anyway, enough about me. Let's talk about you! What are your career aspirations? I'm sure we have some shared interests, like dogs and makeup. I'm always looking for new friends, so let's be friends! Oh, and speaking of makeup, I can't wait to buy ALL THE MAKEUP AND HAIR STUFFS with my first paycheck. And maybe some weed too, can't forget about that ;) It's going to be a long weekend though, with two 10-hour shifts starting at 5am. I just keep telling myself to think of the money and the gifting opportunities that come with it. In terms of my appearance, I've always struggled with body image issues. But I've finally realized that my body is spectacular and not fat like I was told for most of my life. Dayum, I'm hot! And even though I'm not buff or anything, I'm still awesome. Plus, no one has treated me differently at work so far, even though I'm a 22-year-old female security guard breaking the stereotype. Well, I think that's enough rambling for now. I hope you all have a great day and I can't wait to chat with you more in the future. Cheers!
