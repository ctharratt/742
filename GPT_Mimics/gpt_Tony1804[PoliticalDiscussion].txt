Well, well, well, here we are again, discussing politics. It seems like every time I turn around, there's another argument to be had. But hey, that's what makes this country great, right? The ability to have differing opinions and engage in civil discourse. So let's get to it. First off, let's talk about this whole Facebook password thing. Is it really going to make us safer? I'm not so sure. I mean, sure, it might help catch a few bad guys, but at what cost? Giving up our privacy and personal information? No thanks. And let's not even get started on those conspiracy theories. I mean, come on people, let's use some common sense here. Now, onto the topic of Trump and Hillary. As someone who leans towards Trump, I have to say that I think a lot of Republicans don't like him either. And as for Hillary being moderate, well, I'm not so sure about that either. But let's not get bogged down in labels. The fact is, both candidates have their flaws and it's up to us as voters to decide who we think will do the best job. And speaking of labels, can we please stop using the word "establishment"? It's become such a buzzword and it's lost all meaning. And while we're at it, can we stop pretending that Bernie Sanders isn't a career politician? I mean, the guy has been in politics for 30 years. That's pretty much the definition of a career politician. And let's not forget that he's a socialist. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but let's call a spade a spade. Now, let's talk about campaign contributions. Yes, they're important, but let's not pretend that they're the only thing that matters. And let's not demonize billionaires for giving money to politicians. If Elon Musk or Bill Gates were giving billions in contributions, I doubt anyone would have a problem with it. It's just because they're Republicans that people have an issue with it. And as for Sanders and his small donations, well, let's be real here. His campaign wouldn't have gone anywhere without them. And while we're on the topic of campaign finance, let's talk about this new amendment that some people are proposing. How exactly is it going to keep billionaires from giving money to politicians but not regular people like you and me? It seems like a pretty flawed idea to me. Now, let's talk about drugs. Yes, they're bad for society. But let's not pretend that everyone who uses drugs is a freeloader. And let's not forget that the war on drugs has been a complete failure. Maybe it's time to try a different approach. And finally, let's talk about education. Yes, college is important, but it's not for everyone. And let's not pretend that giving everyone a degree is going to solve all our problems. In fact, it might just make things worse. We need to focus on creating jobs that don't require a college degree and providing vocational training for those who want it. In conclusion, let's try to have a little more nuance in our political discussions. Let's not demonize people for having different opinions and let's not resort to name-calling and conspiracy theories. We're all in this together, whether we like it or not.
