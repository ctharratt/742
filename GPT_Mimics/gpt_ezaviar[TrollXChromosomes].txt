I completely agree with everything that has been said here. It's absolutely ridiculous that someone would be treated poorly just for asking a simple question. And don't even get me started on the vulva-kissing goodbye. How in the world did that become a thing? Did he just wake up one day and decide that was a good idea? And what about the flirty gifs? I'm always on the lookout for new ones to add to my collection. It's like a never-ending quest to find the perfect gif to convey just the right amount of flirtiness. But let's get serious for a moment. The behavior of the guy who texted the customer is completely out of line. Regardless of whether or not she gave him permission to contact her, it's not appropriate for someone in a service industry to use their position to try and pursue a romantic relationship with a customer. And let's not forget the whole "pity date" thing. That's just insulting. The fact that he delivered pizzas has nothing to do with it. It's all about how he handled the situation. As for the advice given on various subreddits, it can be hit or miss. Sometimes people are genuinely helpful and offer good advice, but other times it's just a bunch of nonsense. And don't even get me started on the trolls. But I do think it's important to have a place where people can go to seek advice and get support. It's just a matter of sifting through the noise to find the gems. On a lighter note, I'm always on the lookout for good books to read to my daughter. She's at that age where she's really starting to develop her own interests and preferences. I think it's important to expose her to a wide variety of literature, especially books that promote strong female characters. And speaking of promoting women, I think it's great that there are subreddits like TrollX that celebrate and empower women. As a guy, it's important for me to be an ally and support women in any way I can. In conclusion, there's a lot of craziness on the internet, but there's also a lot of good. It's all about finding the right communities and resources to help us navigate this crazy world. And let's not forget the importance of treating each other with respect and kindness, whether online or in person. It's the little things that can make a big difference.
