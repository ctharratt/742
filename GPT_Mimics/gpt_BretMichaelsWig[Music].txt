When it comes to rock music, there are few things that get me as excited as discovering a new band or album that I can really sink my teeth into. Whether it's the raw energy of punk, the bombast of classic hard rock, or the catchy hooks of pop-rock, there's just something about this genre that speaks to me on a deep level. One band that I've been really into lately is Rush. Now, I know they're not everyone's cup of tea, but there's just something about their blend of prog rock and hard rock that really gets me going. I may not listen to them as much as some of my other favorite bands, but I always find myself coming back to their debut album or one of their greatest hits compilations. Speaking of compilations, I recently picked up a two-disc set of Butch Walker's greatest hits, and let me tell you, it's been on heavy rotation in my car ever since. There's just something about his songwriting and guitar playing that really speaks to me, and I find myself getting lost in his music for hours on end. But if we're talking about guitar tone, there's really only one name that comes to mind for me: Johnny Thunders. Specifically, his work on the first two New York Dolls albums and on LAMF. That sound is like a knife, cutting through the mix with a raw, gritty energy that just can't be beat. He may not have been the most technically proficient player, but he knew how to make his guitar work for him, and that's what really matters in the end. Of course, when it comes to guitar gods, we can't forget about Eddie Van Halen and his iconic "Brown" sound. You can tell who's playing guitar from the first note of any of the David Lee Roth-era Van Halen albums, and that's a testament to just how unique and influential his playing was. But enough about guitar players, let's talk about some of the most underrated pop-rock albums of the 90s. There are so many great records from that era that have been forgotten or overlooked, but a few that really stand out to me are Jellyfish's Bellybutton and Spilt Milk, Marvelous 3's Hey! Album, Redd Kross's Phaseshifter, Matthew Sweet's Girlfriend, The Posies' Dear 23, and Imperial Drag's self-titled debut. These albums may not have gotten the recognition they deserved at the time, but they're all worth revisiting today. Of course, when it comes to my all-time favorite bands, there are a few that really stand out. Cheap Trick is definitely up there, with At Budokan, Music for Hangovers, and Silver being some of my favorite albums of all time. AC/DC's If You Want Blood is another classic that I never get tired of listening to, and Hanoi Rocks' All Those Wasted Years is an awesome live album that really captures the energy and excitement of their shows. And let's not forget about Alice Cooper, who in my opinion is one of the most underrated and underappreciated rock stars of all time. His music with the original Alice Cooper Band still stands the test of time, and his stage show was a true spectacle that blended rock concert, performance art, and vaudeville in a way that had never been seen before. He may not be as universally popular as Mick Jagger or other rock legends, but he's a true icon in his own right. Of course, there are so many other bands and albums that I could talk about for hours on end, but I'll leave it at that for now. Suffice it to say that rock music is a genre that will always hold a special place in my heart, and I'm always on the lookout for new bands and albums to discover and enjoy.
