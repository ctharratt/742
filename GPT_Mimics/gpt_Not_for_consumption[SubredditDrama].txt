The usage of the terms "trans" and "cis" in reference to gender identity has been a topic of discussion and debate in recent years. While some argue that these terms are necessary for understanding and discussing gender identity, others feel that they are unnecessary and even pejorative. The origins of the terms "trans" and "cis" can be traced back to Ernst Burchard's Lexikon des gesamten Sexuallebens, which was published in 1914. However, it wasn't until more recently that these terms began to be used in the context of gender identity. For many people, the use of these terms is unfamiliar and even confusing. LGBT individuals are a minority, and not everyone has had exposure to the language and terminology used within the community. As someone who has spent many years around the gay community, I can attest to the fact that gender identity was not a topic that was frequently discussed. In fact, I had never even heard of the term "cis" until relatively recently. While it is possible that trans individuals may use the term "cis" when speaking with one another about gender identity, it is not a term that is commonly used in everyday conversation. In fact, many people may not even be aware of what the term means or how it is used. One of the main arguments against the use of the term "cis" is that it is often used in a negative or derogatory way. While the term is meant to describe individuals who are comfortable with their gender identity and do not experience body dysphoria, it is often used to criticize or belittle those who do not identify as trans. This is not to say that all individuals who use the term "cis" are doing so in a negative way. However, it is important to recognize that the term can be used in a way that is hurtful or offensive to some individuals. Another argument against the use of the term "cis" is that it is a relatively new term that has been applied to gender identity. While the term has been used in other contexts, such as chemistry, its use in relation to gender identity is a relatively recent development. Some individuals feel that the use of the term "cis" is unnecessary and even divisive. They argue that it creates a sense of "us vs. them" and can lead to further division within the LGBT community. However, others argue that the term "cis" is necessary for understanding and discussing gender identity. They argue that it is important to have language and terminology that accurately reflects the experiences of trans individuals and helps to create a more inclusive and accepting society. Ultimately, the use of the term "cis" is a matter of personal preference. Some individuals may find it helpful and empowering, while others may find it unnecessary or even offensive. Regardless of one's personal feelings about the term, it is important to recognize that gender identity is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires sensitivity, understanding, and respect. By working together and engaging in open and honest dialogue, we can create a more inclusive and accepting society for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity.
