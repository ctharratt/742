Hey there! I gotta say, I love your username. It's got a certain ring to it that just rolls off the tongue. Speaking of things that roll off the tongue, I just finished writing a short film screenplay with my buddy and I'm pretty excited about it. We've been collaborating for a while now and it's always a blast to bounce ideas off each other and see where the story takes us. But enough about me, let's talk about you. I'm curious, have you watched Jessica Jones yet? I loved Daredevil, but I have to admit, I was hesitant about Jessica Jones. Let me know what you think if you get around to watching it. And speaking of unexpected things, thanks for the dose of mushroom knowledge earlier. I never knew there was so much to learn about fungi! It's always great to learn something new. On a completely unrelated note, have you ever seen the Scooby Doo movie from 2001? There's this one line that always sticks with me, when Scrappy Doo says something to Scooby and he responds with "don't cha mean Melvin Doo" and points at the guy next to him. I quote it all the time and it always gets a laugh. But let's get back on track. I'm really curious about how you got into growing mushrooms. It's not something you hear about every day, so I'd love to hear your story. And congrats on the weight loss! It's always great to hear about people making positive changes in their lives. Although, I have to say, I'm a little appalled that you weren't allowed to read certain books growing up. Do you mind if I find whoever was responsible and give them a good talking to? But I'm glad you're happy now and able to read whatever you want. Before you got into kids books, what were some of your favorite books? I'm always looking for new recommendations. And speaking of work, what kind of work do you do from home? I'm always curious about people's jobs and how they make it work from home. Now, I have to ask, would it make a difference if the tattoos we put in people's colons were public knowledge? It's a pretty cool thing we do, marking the spot to be investigated during future colonoscopies or for surgeons to remove that area of the colon. But let's move on to something a little less... invasive. How do you feel about Beck? I think they're great and I may even go play one of their songs now. Although, I have to admit, I'm more of a FIFA and Call of Duty kind of person. But I definitely need to get my hands on Rock Band again. I remember spending hours playing those drums. And speaking of writing, I just finished reading City On Fire and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone. It's a great book and I can't wait to see what the author comes out with next. Before I forget, I have to say, your middle name is awesome. I have a friend who loves LOTR and I know he would be jealous. But let's get back to books. What's the last book you read? I'm always looking for new recommendations. And speaking of recommendations, have you ever seen Luther? I'm curious about that show but I'm also hesitant about crime shows. But let's talk about your future. What type of shows would you ideally be writing? I'm always interested in hearing about people's creative aspirations. And speaking of reading, what's on your reading list? I'm always looking for new books to add to my list. But let's switch gears again. I'm really curious about what it's like to own a cat dog. I used to love that show when I was a kid. And speaking of Pittsburgh, where did you live around there? I'm from the area too and it's always great to meet someone else from the Steel City. But let's get back to books again. Have you ever heard of or read A Little Life? It's a great book but it's also a tough read. And speaking of tough reads, have you ever analyzed Chinatown? I know it's supposed to be a flawless script but the movie felt stale to me. But let's end on a positive note. What's the best compliment you've ever received? For me, it's when someone tells me that my writing is like a mind fuck and they need to reread it. Thanks for chatting with me and have a great day!
