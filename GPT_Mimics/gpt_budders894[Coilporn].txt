Hey there fellow vapers! I've been having some issues with my setup lately and I was hoping to get some advice from the community.  First off, I've been using the ohm meter that came with my kit and it's been fluctuating quite a bit. It didn't go below 0.1 ohms, but it did fluctuate by +/- 0.5 from the original ohm reading. I made sure the battery was freshly charged, but I'm not sure if it's replaceable. I've been building my own coils, but they keep burning out. I'm thinking of trying OCC coils, but I'm not sure if they're safe to use with my setup.  I've also been wondering if RDA's hit better than the Atlantis tank. I've heard people say they're comparable in terms of vapor production, but I'm not sure which one to go for. I've been using the Kanger Subtank, but I've been having issues with it burning cotton. I think it might be because the juice takes a while to soak up through the tank since the holes are so small. Does anyone have any suggestions for a decent RDA around $20? I'm definitely planning on getting a higher quality one soon, but I just need something to hold me over for now.  Speaking of my Subtank, I've been having some issues with my mod as well. I got a new Sony battery and charged it up, but it still won't work. My other battery won't work either and the positive pin seems to be tightly cranked down. It's a mech mod and the pin is tight, so I'm not sure what the issue could be. I've tried messing with the screws, but it's not firing at all.  I've been experimenting with different coils and I've found that a single coil with a thinner jig piece works best for me. It came out to 0.5 ohms and produces thick clouds without bothering my lungs like the double coil 0.28 ohm coils did. I'm thinking of optimizing it even more, but I'm not sure how to make it look like a double barrel. How would I hook it up to the 3 prong posts?  I've also been curious about coils that rest on the bed of cotton. They look cool and make sense, but I'm not sure how to make them. Do I just space the coil out in the middle on each coil? Wouldn't less wire be less resistance/lower ohms which would get hot too? Any more info on this? I'm new to vaping and still learning the ropes.  Overall, I've been having some issues with my setup and I'm hoping to get some advice from the community. I appreciate any help or suggestions you can offer. Thanks for reading!
