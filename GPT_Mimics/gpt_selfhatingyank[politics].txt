I'm with Canada, not with stupid. That's what every major world religion would say if they could speak out on the current state of American politics. And honestly, who can blame them? The entertainment value of watching Donald Trump say the sort of things about the Republican establishment and the Tea Party that we've known all along is undeniable. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion, you just can't look away. But let's get serious for a moment. There are some important issues at stake in this election, and we need to be paying attention. Take for example the recent claim that black Americans were better off at the end of Bill Clinton's term. This claim has been thoroughly debunked, with evidence showing that while Hispanics may have seen some improvement, African Americans did not enjoy much of the growth from the 90s. In fact, roughly a fifth of black income evaporated under Obama, having huge negative effects on everything from being able to pay fines to affording health insurance to income mobility statistics. And let's not forget that Trump isn't at a majority yet. If all the other candidates either rally behind Rubio and don't lose too many votes to Trump OR all hold out to the convention, robbing Trump of a majority, and then endorse Rubio on the first or second ballot, Rubio has a path to victory. It's narrow, but it's not impossible. Cruz and his voters are the question mark, but anything can happen in politics. Adding to this, many victims of gang violence were themselves black, and many voters (and even many experts) were not aware of the potential consequences of mass incarceration. At the same time, the nineties were probably the best time in U.S. history for the black and Hispanic middle class. Hindsight is 20/20, but we need to learn from our mistakes and move forward. It's not just about the candidates themselves, though. Billionaires are also getting involved in this election, with Tom Steyer leaning towards Bernie Sanders. And it's not just him - even billionaires who don't agree with Sanders on policy all the time, like Charles Koch, Mark Cuban, and Warren Buffett, have praised him. All three of those dudes are billionaires, even though one is a Republican and the others are undeclared and a Hillary voter. It just goes to show that this election is about more than just the candidates themselves. But let's talk about the candidates for a moment. It's refreshing to see two candidates who easily could play dirty being comparatively civil and friendly in speeches, even if their campaign staffers and supporters don't always hold the same level of civility. Imagine either of them running against Trump, Cruz, or indeed any Republican except Kasich or maybe Rubio. Moments like this make me proud to be a Democrat. Of course, not everyone is happy with the current state of American politics. The Citizens United decision significantly went against precedent and against the consensus 20 years ago, and climate skepticism only became a part of the Republican platform around '09. Although they might've been socially conservative, the Republicans at the time of Scalia's nomination would be considered moderate Democrats today. But it's not just about politics. It's about the people who are affected by these decisions. An elderly, homeowning black Democrat from the Mississippi Delta or the Carolina Lowcountry who still is kind of suspicious of city-slickers and gay marriage, goes to a Primitive Baptist church, drives a gas-guzzling American car, and who hardly ever interacts with cops because she lives in a town of 500 with a black mayor, black-majority city council, and black-majority police force consisting of exactly 5 officers, however? Totally different ballgame and in many ways much closer to the blue-collar rural Iowa Dems who kept Hillary from outright losing. And let's not forget about healthcare. Germany and Switzerland have something in between the American and the Canadian system, with mandatory insurance but price controls to make sure no one is uninsured. Healthcare for all has been a goal of government since at least the days of Charlemagne, and even dirt poor countries in say Africa aspire to it someday. Only Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland have what Bernie calls single-payer. Almost everywhere else either has Obamacare but more tightly regulated or free care EXCEPT for prescriptions. There are a lot of issues at stake in this election, and it's important that we pay attention to them. TPP, intellectual property, and fair drug prices are just a few of the issues that need to be addressed. And let's not forget about the potential consequences of a Sanders nomination leading to a Bloomberg run, which with Trump as the nominee would make things infinitely better for the oligarchs. There's a reason Republicans are salivating at a Sanders nomination. But at the end of the day, it's not just about the politics. It's about the people who are affected by these decisions. A US that openly supports and aspires to social democracy would likely crush the austerity right in Europe or elsewhere. In-place health systems would suddenly be more secure without American corporations dispatching lobbyists to swarm Brussels and Ottawa. And who knows, maybe we'll even have a reason to have kids if apocalyptic climate change is no longer the status quo. So let's pay attention to the issues, and let's make sure that our voices are heard. Whether we're with Canada or not, we all have a stake in this election.
