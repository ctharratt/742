Between all the things that have been happening lately, I wouldn't be surprised if the world just decided to hit the reset button and start over. It's like we're living in some sort of twisted simulation where everything that can go wrong, does go wrong. And the worst part is, it's not just one thing. It's a never-ending barrage of chaos and tragedy. Take the recent story on This American Life, for example. A man, who was already in the hospital as a patient, was shot in the chest by police. And why? Because he was black. It's sickening to think that in this day and age, we still have to deal with this kind of blatant racism and police brutality. And what's even more infuriating is that this isn't an isolated incident. It's happening all over the country, all the time. But it's not just the police. It's the entire justice system that's broken. We have people being locked up for minor offenses and serving longer sentences than they deserve, while white-collar criminals get off with a slap on the wrist. And don't even get me started on the for-profit prison industry. It's a disgusting business that preys on the most vulnerable members of our society. And then there's the issue of voter ID laws. It's a thinly veiled attempt to suppress the votes of minorities and low-income individuals. The fact that we even have to fight for the right to vote in this day and age is ridiculous. And yet, here we are, still having to fight tooth and nail for basic human rights. But it's not just the big issues that are getting me down. It's the little things too. Like the fact that I always forget to vote online. Or the fact that I spent five minutes filing my joint income tax return with my husband. It's like we're all just going through the motions, trying to survive in a world that seems to be falling apart at the seams. And then there's the story of the couple who went on Playboy. Apparently, it was their dad's suggestion. And the only thing they have to show for their personal lives is that they've had babies. It's a sad commentary on our society that people feel like they have to resort to that kind of thing to get attention or make a living. But maybe that's just it. Maybe we're all just trying to survive in a world that doesn't make sense anymore. Maybe we're all just trying to find a way to make ends meet and keep our heads above water. And maybe, just maybe, that's enough. Because at the end of the day, all we can do is keep going. We can keep fighting for what's right, even when it feels like we're fighting a losing battle. We can keep pushing forward, even when it feels like the world is pushing back. And we can keep hoping, even when hope seems like a distant dream. So maybe the world is hitting the reset button. Maybe we're all just living in a simulation that's gone haywire. But maybe, just maybe, we can still make a difference. Maybe we can still change things for the better. And maybe, just maybe, we can still find a way to make this world a better place.
