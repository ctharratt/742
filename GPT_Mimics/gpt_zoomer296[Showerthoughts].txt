Oh boy, where do I even begin? I mean, I misread the prompt and ended up making an app called "The Farnz" that was supposed to improve battery life, but now my tablet's screen won't even turn on. And then I start thinking about Inferni and Nasaghasts and all the secrets the government might be keeping from us. What if the second coming of Jesus is just a misinterpretation of a future alien invasion? I mean, it's not like I use acronyms all that often, but am I weird for that? Should I start making parody music? Nah, I'll pass. But then I start thinking about this dream I had where Steve Jobs let it slip that most of Apple's products were created by reverse-engineering alien technology, and I found out where they were hiding it. But I don't really want an Apple-sponsored nationwide manhunt for me, you know? And then I start worrying about whether our data is backed up and if we'll be restored if something goes wrong. And then I start thinking about sleep paralysis and how terrifying it is, and how people would never "rage quit" again if they experienced it. And then I start thinking about this terrible idea for a movie where terrorists are portrayed as the stupidest, most vile people on the planet, and one of the two people in love must die, or the film must be so heavily Christian that whenever the DVD case is opened, a Bible materializes in the room. And don't even get me started on what happens if you pirate it. And who gets beaten up by Biff's grandson? I mean, seriously? But then I start thinking about cars and how they're able to get software updates that allow them to almost drive themselves. And in December, there's going to be a nine dollar computer that can run a full desktop operating system. And now it's even possible to pirate LEGO. Technology is advancing faster than conservatives are running for president, that's for sure. And then I start thinking about how gas masks don't seal when you have a beard, and how fundamentalists in southern Alabama are already blaming same-sex marriage for the thunderstorms they're having. And then I start thinking about how an AI would probably reduce the world's population to a more manageable number, and how reflector telescopes use mirrors while refractor telescopes only use lenses. But then I start doubting myself because I've had a somewhat fucked up childhood between then and now. And then I start thinking about how an AI might see movies depicting evil AIs and get pissed off, and start destroying humanity. And how humanity's attempts to stop it only piss it off worse. And then I start thinking about how keeping people standing under their own weight will be our greatest enemy before long, and how the chemical-filled food we eat gives us resistance to radiation. But then I start thinking about how we only know what we're allowed to find out, and how somebody needs to make a movie about an AI that is good but sees movies depicting evil AIs and starts destroying humanity. And how when it has completely destroyed humanity, it realizes what it has done and spends the rest of its operating time with deep regret. And then I start thinking about how people are losing their shit about Victoria, but that guy who was fired for having leukemia can go fuck himself. And how gas masks don't seal when you have a beard. And how showerthought is a loose term that applies to any thought you might have while carrying out a routine task like showering, driving, or daydreaming. And then I start thinking about how my niece learned about 9/11 at school today and obviously wasn't paying attention. She thought it happened about a hundred years ago, and around four-hundred people died. And how if my parents had a sign, it would've said "Lots of babies on board, hit with your best shot." And how Justice Scalia was offended when same-sex marriage was legalized, and how anyone can marry now. And then I start thinking about how somebody needs to make a movie about an AI that is good but sees movies depicting evil AIs and starts destroying humanity. And how when it has completely destroyed humanity, it realizes what it has done and spends the rest of its operating time with deep regret. And how keeping people standing under their own weight will be our greatest enemy before long, and how the chemical-filled food we eat gives us resistance to radiation.
