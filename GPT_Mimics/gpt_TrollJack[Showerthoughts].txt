Lol, no way man. I mean, seriously, that wouldn't even be illegal here. And it wasn't even my weed, so what are you even talking about? OMG, that made me laugh out loud in a bar! :D But seriously, let's talk about something more important. Like the existence of God. I mean, I honestly doubt that there will be a god in the not too distant future. At least - hopefully - not an anthropomorphized one. All others are fine, because they don't talk. And the one before that. And before that. And so on. Just admit it. ;) Or we could talk about skipping. Skipping is wrong, man. I mean, I knew a person, who I actually miss quite a lot, who had this thing where she checked her body for scratches and harm every ten-ish minutes. I hope she's okay... But let's talk about something more fun. Like the fact that we never actually touch anything. It's photons transmitting information between the atoms of the object and the atoms of our fingers that give us the illusion of touching something. Crazy, right? And speaking of crazy, let's talk about suicide attempts. Did you know that it's common for every suicide attempt? Yeah, it's true. But let's not dwell on that. Let's talk about something more uplifting. Like the fact that every day is the first day of the rest of your life. One day it's also the last. Have a nice day! :D But seriously, let's talk about something that really grinds my gears. People who think they know everything. I mean, over the last decades I've noticed that more and more people tend to believe they either know all answers, or believe they know better than others, despite it being obvious that they don't. It's an incredibly smart and self-reflective thought to realize that you don't know everything. Kudos to those who do. And let's not forget about the importance of standards. I mean, speak for yourself, but I'm quite happy with the fact that I have standards and don't brainlessly put my dick into anyone. Keep your sexism for yourself. I'm sure not every guy is like how you portrait us. But let's talk about something more lighthearted. Like the fact that farts can't actually smell anything. Crazy, right? And speaking of crazy, let's talk about Kim Jong Ill. Forever young, though of course he chooses to get older and die of old age so his dear followers don't feel too disconnected from their glorious leader. But let's not forget about the importance of education. I mean, it's important to remember that every day is a learning experience. Even though hundreds of thousands will never need it, there will always be those few who will. And for those few, it was well worth it. In the end, you never know; eventually, it might be you. And let's not forget about the importance of friendship. I mean, it's important to have real friends who care about you. Not just "friends" who use you for their own benefit. And if you're having trouble finding real friends, just be around people for a few weeks. Do things for your own happiness. Fuck people, really. With that attitude, you'll find better friends, because you won't attract assholes who seek dependent people. But let's not forget about the importance of technology. I mean, it's crazy how much technology has advanced over the years. Like with mobile phones nowadays, no one needs to remember numbers anymore, which was normal in the time of landline phones. Of course, there are downsides to technology. They make life "easier" in the sense that we need to use our brain less than before. That's how it is. And let's not forget about the importance of humor. I mean, humor is what makes life worth living. Like the fact that Bielefeld in Germany doesn't actually exist. Or the fact that the image loaded slowly, making the movement ten times slower, increasing the OMGWTF realization a hundred times. Or the fact that a 6-year-old once applied for a job at a railroad museum and was hired as its director of fun! How awesome is that? But let's not forget about the importance of reality. I mean, in the end, reality is all we have. And sometimes reality can be harsh. Like the fact that you're going to die. Eventually. Not today. Maybe. But that's just the way it is. And we have to accept it. So, in conclusion, let's not forget about the importance of all these things. Friendship, education, technology, humor, reality, and so much more. They all play a role in making our lives worth living. And let's not forget to laugh along the way. Because, in the end, laughter is the best medicine.
