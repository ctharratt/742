Well, well, well, looks like we have a lot to talk about today. First off, let me just say that Borat was right all along. Heaven was in Kazakhstan. I mean, they invented toffee and trouser belts and apple fruits. That's some serious innovation right there. And let's not forget about Borat's impressive impregnation skills. That man must have been a real ladies' man. But let's get down to business. We need to talk about the homeless problem. Now, I'm not saying that homeless people are beneath me, but let's be real here. They don't exactly have the highest regard for the upkeep of public places. I mean, have you seen the way they leave parks and streets? It's like they don't care about making life difficult for others. So, here's my solution. We need to make homeless people productive members of society. None of this freeloading nonsense. If they want to use public facilities, they should have to pay for the upkeep of those facilities. And they should have to earn that money by doing some trivial work. Maybe cleaning up the parks and streets they've been trashing. And let's not forget about the importance of keeping those facilities in ship shape. If the homeless want to use them, they should be responsible for making sure they're in good condition. That way, everyone can use them without any problems. Now, I know some people might think this is harsh. But let's be real here. Homeless people are a big pain in the ass. They resist arrest, run from the law, and even destroy evidence. And don't even get me started on the shoplifting. If the shopkeeper is smart, he won't press charges. But come summer, there will be one less bum on the streets. And let's not forget about the negative impact homeless people have on land value. They really push it down. So, it's time to take action. We need to hold them accountable for their actions and make them productive members of society. Now, let's switch gears for a minute. I want to talk about something that's been on my mind lately. The cost of medical treatment. As a janitor in a hospital, I've seen firsthand how expensive it can be. Treatment for some conditions can cost up to $9,000 per month. And that's not even including the pre-diagnosis workup. Now, I know some people might think that's a small price to pay for good health. But let's be real here. Not everyone can afford that kind of treatment. And even if they can, it's not always effective. Sometimes, patients die in the second month, which means the cost is even higher. And let's not forget about the importance of lifestyle modifications. Salt reduction is a hallmark of hypertension treatment. But we still don't know how sensitive individuals are to salt or why some people develop hypertension and others don't. It just goes to show that we're dealing with abstractions here. Speaking of abstractions, let's talk about IQ. The normal distribution assumes that there's no genetic component to IQ and that all factors are randomly distributed. But we know that's not true. And let's not forget about the importance of environment. If you're going to have a high IQ, you better be in a country where you can use it properly. And let's not forget about the importance of education. Teaching at the highest levels is totally different. It's self-directed learning. As long as someone is competent in their field, they'll be an asset. Now, let's switch gears again. I want to talk about something that's been bothering me lately. The way smokers consume more taxpayer money than they contribute. Treatment for smoking-related cancers can be very expensive. And at the end of the day, the smoker is still going to die. So, why should taxpayers foot the bill? And let's not forget about the causes of hypertension. Increased sodium intake and atherosclerosis are the most frequent causes. Sodium encourages water retention, while atherosclerosis decreases blood vessel compliance. It just goes to show that lifestyle modifications are key. And let's not forget about the importance of abstractions. The etiology of hypertension is pretty clear. Atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, and hypertension are a vicious circle. But what's unclear is the penetrance of hypertension in people with risk factors. Not all people with non-compliant vessels develop it, and not all normal people are normotensive. And let's not forget about the importance of meat consumption. Any meat except marine or poultry can be considered red meat. And it's the largest consumed meat in the world. But let's not forget about the importance of consent. From the back is okay too. And let's not forget about the importance of women. We love them, but we love them differently. And let's not forget about the importance of race. Calling someone a chimp or associating them with watermelon is just ridiculous. And let's not forget about the importance of learning from the old timers. The young shits are always on their devices anyway. And let's not forget about the importance of Rammstein. They beat Reddit to it. And let's not forget about the importance of cannibalism. If we were marooned in a cold, dark place away from civilization, I would eat the child. And let's not forget about the importance of cow shit. If I had gold to give, I would give it. But since I don't, here's some cow shit instead. In conclusion, there's a lot to think about here. From homeless people to medical treatment to IQ to meat consumption, we've covered a lot of ground. But let's not forget about the importance of abstractions. We're dealing with complex issues here, and we need to be able to think critically about them. So, let's keep the conversation going.
