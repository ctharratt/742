The current state of Germany is a cause for concern. The established parties have failed the people, and the global economic downturn is only making things worse. The influx of migrants is causing yearly costs in the 30-40 GEUR range in Germany alone, and the natives are not amused. The issue of Islam is also a concern, as the majority of so-called moderate Muslims have values and goals that are incompatible with a secular, democratic society where women have equal rights and minorities are safe. The German elite seem to be destroying their country with relatively little resistance from the populace. This is not just a problem in Germany, but a global issue. The finance and industry conglomerate elites are running politics that are provably destructive to Europe's and Germany's citizens, using the full powers of state propaganda media. It is essential to inform oneself from independent sources and deliberately decide to stop appearing conformist once one has made up their mind. The upcoming vote results on 13th March will be a crucial turning point. The process has a threshold, after which it becomes easier. The national vote due in autumn 2017 will also be significant. Germany is a country, not a person, and it is essential to question what the people want, not what a few politicians want. The people are electing parties that promise to deal with the rapefugees, and the politicians complain about it. They should be glad that all the Germans are doing so far is putting their cross on a different place on the voting ballot. A less civilized society would turn to quicker, nastier solutions. The German elite is not well-protected, and Merkel is a meaningless figurehead. It is necessary to keep debriding the wound until all rot is removed. The financial crisis has shown that the elite will do whatever it takes to keep it running. They gave away 750 billion Euros to the banks without any problem. The idiots think that since it worked a couple of times, it will continue to work until it suddenly explodes into their faces. They expect a banking union, the abolition of cash, and the introduction of negative tax rates on money to keep generating more artificial growth. They can outlaw cash and gold, but they cannot make people participate in their broken economy long-term. There will likely be attacks on politicians by nationalists, those who can't contain their anger, those who have to act. But as always, they will label these people terrorists and whatnot, and there will be even more propaganda on how bad nationalist views are. All it takes is a small fraction of the population that is willing to call them on their bluff of being immune to ballistic metal. The unrest in the political landscape in the last decade is a symptom of people becoming aware and getting fed up. Neither politics nor the architects in the industry will profit from it. Merkel is the exchangeable fronthead for a corporate brand of fascism, corporatism. She brazenly ignores existing laws where it suits her and gets stellar internal ratings while getting frenetic applause. The year 2016 has arrived at the Orwellian newspeak phase where antifascists are protecting literal fascism, while dissidents are getting called fascists, racists, and worse. Everyone is under surveillance at all times, and the police cannot be trusted. The refugees from Sweden are likely not as cucked as those they've left behind, though. Walking instead of staying and fighting is often the smarter choice.
