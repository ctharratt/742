When it comes to relationships, there are a lot of different factors that can come into play. Whether it's issues with communication, trust, or just general compatibility, there are a lot of things that can make or break a relationship. And when it comes to the post that I'm responding to, there are definitely a lot of different issues at play. One of the first things that stood out to me was the suggestion that the poster seek therapy. While therapy isn't always the answer, it can be incredibly helpful in situations where someone is dealing with a lot of emotional stress or trauma. And given the fact that the poster's grandmother is in poor health and they're dealing with a lot of relationship issues, it seems like therapy could be a really good option for them. Of course, therapy isn't the only thing that the poster needs to consider. They also mentioned that their grandmother isn't eligible for hospice care, but that they do have skilled nursing coming in three times a week. While this is certainly better than nothing, it's still a lot of responsibility for the poster to take on. And if their grandmother's heart is failing, it's definitely worth pursuing a heart failure diagnosis to see if hospice care might be an option. Moving on to the poster's personal life, there are definitely a lot of issues there as well. They mentioned that they've been sleeping with someone who isn't treating them well, and that they're considering staying with them because of their baby. This is a really tough situation to be in, and it's understandable that the poster would feel conflicted. But ultimately, staying with someone who isn't treating you well is never a good idea. And using a baby as a reason to stay in a bad relationship is also not a good idea. One thing that the poster might want to consider is taking control of their own sexuality. They mentioned that they've been using a vibrator to avoid sleeping with people they shouldn't be sleeping with, and this is actually a really good strategy. By taking control of their own sexual needs, the poster can avoid getting involved with people who aren't good for them. And this can be especially important when they're dealing with a lot of emotional stress and trauma. Another issue that the poster mentioned was their partner's behavior. They said that their partner justified their bad behavior by pointing out all the things they do around the house and for their child. This is definitely not okay, and it's important for the poster to recognize that. If someone is treating you poorly, it doesn't matter how much they do for you in other areas of your life. And if they're not willing to take responsibility for their actions, it's unlikely that they'll change. The poster also mentioned issues with their partner's mother. They said that their partner's mother is racist and has issues with their relationship because of the poster's race. This is a really tough situation to be in, and it's important for the poster to recognize that they deserve better. If someone is racist towards you, it's unlikely that they'll ever change. And if your partner is willing to tolerate that kind of behavior, it's a sign that they don't value you as much as they should. Finally, the poster mentioned issues with their partner's friendships. They said that their partner has a lot of male friends and doesn't get along well with women. While this might seem like a red flag, it's actually not that uncommon. Some people just get along better with members of the opposite sex, and that's okay. What's important is that the poster trusts their partner and feels secure in their relationship. If they don't, then that's something that they need to work on. Overall, there are a lot of different issues at play in the poster's situation. But by taking control of their own sexuality, seeking therapy, and recognizing their own worth, they can start to make positive changes in their life. And while it won't be easy, it's definitely worth it in the end.
