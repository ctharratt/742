It's been a few weeks since we last discussed the possibility of moving Pryor to a LB role in our defense. While he currently has a LB type role, I still believe he's too good in coverage to be a full-time linebacker. Cro, on the other hand, has never been torched in coverage, so if he accepts the 4th CB job, I'd welcome him. Otherwise, it's time to move on. As for Bilal Powell, if he walks, we obviously need a new feature back. However, it doesn't make sense to let Bilal walk in order to get a washed-up over-the-hill guy like Forte who is going to make more money on top of that. I don't see Powell asking for more than 3 mil. per year on a 2-3 year deal. You can probably get him for 10 mil. for 3 years, maybe 2 mil. for 1 year even. After the year he's had (missing half the season), there's no way he's going to take a long-term deal, so you can easily get him for cheap just like last year when he signed a 1 year 2 mil. deal. Forte is probably closer to 4-5 mil. per year I'd imagine. Pass rush and LT can be addressed in FA, that's true. But in order to land those, you have to open up the wallet. You're not going to get a guy like Osemele or Bruce Irvin unless you pay up, and we can't afford to pay those guys. So I'd rather draft those guys in the first 3 rounds. I have faith in Macc & Bowles. This isn't Tanny & Rex anymore. ;-) As for Revis, I wouldn't mind him for depth purposes, but I don't think he'd do that, and I don't think he'd take that type of contract. If we bring him back, it'll probably be on a 1-2 year 4-8 mil. deal or something like that, and he'll once again be handed the starting job without earning it, just like last year when he was getting embarrassed and torched on a daily basis in camp and preseason and still found his way into the starting lineup despite how Skrine & Marcus Williams outplayed him. I would not mind having him back as the 4th corner, but I'd rather not have him back at all because chances are if we do re-sign him, he'll end up starting for us. So hopefully he goes to the Cowboys or Redskins or something and starts for them. He'll have other opportunities to start; he's not going to be back as the #4 for the Jets. I really don't see that. Please do NOT re-sign him. Move Marcus to the starting lineup and let's move on. We have enough depth. We have to get younger and more explosive, especially on defense. As for Harris, he's ok in coverage. Above average, solid. Let's not act like the typical MLB can actually cover. You have good cover guys like Sean Lee or Kuechly, but they are the exception. The vast majority can't really cover. But Harris is getting old, so we do need to draft somebody who can take over there because Harris can't keep up with RB's anymore in coverage. I wouldn't even mind lining up Pryor at MLB in obvious passing downs, like 2nd and long, 3rd and long. I said WITHOUT a run-stuffing NT, WITHOUT a great pass-rushing OLB, WITHOUT two very good ILB's, it makes no sense to run the 3-4. With Snacks, Harris & Davis/Henderson, Sheldon/Mauldin, we at least had SOME pieces to the puzzle to function out of the 3-4. But with Harris now a year older, Snacks maybe out of the picture, Davis gone, it virtually makes absolutely no sense anymore at this point to play the 3-4 outside of throwing offenses off a little by confusing them. I'd still sprinkle the 3-4 in there every once in a while just to confuse offenses and be able to blitz more from different angles, etc., but personnel-wise, the 4-3 is a perfect fit for us. I'd love to have Mauldin at DE along with Sheldon, and inside at DT, you have Leonard & Mo. At MLB, Harris gets the job done, and then you go find 2 capable OLB's. Maybe even move Pryor to OLB like the Panthers did with Thomas Davis. He'd be a stud in coverage and vs. the run. As for the RB position, you don't waste your 1st round pick on a RB if you have other holes. You can find capable RB's through free agency without giving up anything or even paying them a lot of money. You can't do that with LT's or edge rushers. In terms of the draft, I think we need to focus on getting younger and more explosive on defense. We need to find a pass rusher and a LT. I wouldn't mind taking a chance on a powerback late in the draft to complement Powell, but we need to focus on our defense first. Overall, I have faith in Macc & Bowles to make the right moves in free agency and the draft. We need to get younger and more explosive on defense, and we need to address our pass rush and LT positions. Let's not waste our money on over-the-hill players like Forte or Revis. Let's focus on building a strong, young, and explosive team that can compete for years to come.
