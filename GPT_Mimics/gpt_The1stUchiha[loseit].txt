I've been struggling with my weight for as long as I can remember. It's not that I don't want to be healthy, it's just that I find it really difficult to stick to a healthy lifestyle. I've tried everything from fad diets to intense workout routines, but nothing seems to work for me. That's why I've been reaching out to others for advice and support. One thing that I've been trying to do is cut out unhealthy foods from my diet. I used to drink a lot of soda and eat a lot of sweets, but I've been trying to cut back on those things. Instead, I've been eating more fruits and vegetables and trying to stay within my calorie limit. I've also been drinking a lot more water, which has been helping me feel more full and satisfied throughout the day. Another thing that I've been struggling with is finding an exercise routine that works for me. I've tried running, swimming, and even going to the gym, but I always seem to lose motivation after a few weeks. Recently, I've been trying to incorporate more walking into my daily routine. I've been taking the stairs instead of the elevator and going for short walks during my lunch break. It's not a lot, but it's a start. One thing that I've been really struggling with is my body image. I have stretch marks and excess weight, which makes me feel really self-conscious. I've been trying to find ways to feel more confident in my own skin, but it's been a struggle. I recently tried going to a public pool to swim, but they wouldn't let me wear a t-shirt. It made me feel really uncomfortable and embarrassed. I'm not sure what to do about it, but I'm trying to stay positive and keep pushing forward. I've also been trying to find healthy foods that I actually enjoy eating. I recently tried kale, avocado, and tofu, but I didn't really like any of them. I'm not very good with spices, so I've been trying to find simple recipes that are easy to make and don't require a lot of ingredients. I recently tried marinated tofu, which wasn't too bad. I cut it into little chunks and fried it until it was golden on all sides. It wasn't the best thing I've ever tasted, but it was better than some of the other things I've tried. One thing that I struggle with is binge eating. When I get really hungry, I tend to eat a lot of food all at once. It's not healthy, and it makes me feel really bad afterwards. I've been trying to eat smaller meals throughout the day to avoid getting too hungry. I've also been trying to find healthy snacks that I can eat when I'm feeling hungry between meals. Overall, I'm just trying to take things one day at a time. I know that losing weight and getting healthy is a long-term process, and I'm trying to be patient with myself. I'm grateful for all of the support and advice that I've received from others, and I'm looking forward to continuing on this journey towards a healthier lifestyle.
