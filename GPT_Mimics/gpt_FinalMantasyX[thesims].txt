As a virtual world enthusiast, I have always been fascinated by the Sims franchise. From the early days of Sims 1 to the latest iteration of Sims 4, I have spent countless hours building, decorating, and living out my virtual life. However, as much as I love the game, there are certain aspects of it that I find frustrating and limiting. One of the biggest issues I have with Sims 4 is the small text size. As someone who uses a TV as a monitor, I find it difficult to read the text on the screen. This makes it hard to navigate the game and can be a real hindrance when trying to build or decorate a house. While I have tried using mods like mccommand to address this issue, it doesn't seem to work for me. Another issue I have with Sims 4 is the lack of variety in the world. While the game does offer different neighborhoods and areas, they all feel very similar and lack the distinct themes and aesthetics that were present in earlier versions of the game. This makes it hard to create unique and interesting environments, and can be a real challenge for players who want to build something truly special. One argument that has been made in defense of Sims 4's world design is that having separate neighborhoods and areas allows for more variety and detail. However, I don't think this is necessarily true. While it is possible to create distinct areas within a larger world, it requires a lot of effort and attention to detail. Sims 4's neighborhoods feel more like separate entities that don't really connect with each other, which can be frustrating for players who want a more cohesive and immersive experience. Another issue I have with Sims 4 is the lack of creativity and variety in the game's objects and items. While there are certainly a lot of different items to choose from, they all feel very similar and lack the unique charm and personality that was present in earlier versions of the game. This makes it hard to create truly unique and interesting environments, and can be a real challenge for players who want to build something that stands out. One argument that has been made in defense of Sims 4's object design is that it allows for more customization and flexibility. While this is certainly true to some extent, I don't think it's enough to make up for the lack of creativity and variety in the game's objects and items. Sims 4 needs more unique and interesting items that can help players create truly unique and memorable environments. Overall, while I still enjoy playing Sims 4, I do think there are some significant issues with the game's design that need to be addressed. From the small text size to the lack of variety in the world and objects, there are a lot of areas where the game could be improved. However, I remain hopeful that the developers will continue to listen to player feedback and work to make the game even better in the future.
