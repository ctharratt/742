For example, if you are not using Bluetooth or NFC, turn them off. You can also turn off location services when you are not using them. This will help to conserve battery life.

However, you can reduce the brightness to conserve battery life. You can also reduce the screen timeout to a shorter duration. If you are still experiencing battery drain, you can try using a battery saver app. There are many battery saver apps available on the Google Play Store that can help to extend the battery life of your Nexus 5. Some popular battery saver apps include Greenify, DU Battery Saver, and Battery Doctor. Performance Issues Another common issue that users face with the Nexus 5 is performance issues. The phone comes with a Snapdragon 800 processor and 2GB of RAM, which is still quite capable. However, over time, the phone can start to slow down and become sluggish. One of the first things you can do to improve the performance of your Nexus 5 is to clear the cache. The cache is a temporary storage area that stores data for apps and processes.

Another thing you can do is to uninstall any apps that you are not using. Unused apps can take up valuable storage space and slow down the phone. You can also disable any pre-installed apps that you are not using. If you are still experiencing performance issues, you can try a factory reset. A factory reset will erase all data on your phone and restore it to its original state. This can help to improve the performance of your Nexus 5. However, make sure to backup all your data before doing a factory reset. Overheating The Nexus 5 can also suffer from overheating issues. Overheating can be caused by a number of factors, including heavy usage, running too many apps at once, or using the phone while it is charging.

If you are using the phone for heavy tasks, such as gaming or video streaming, try to take breaks to allow the phone to cool down.

You can also try to use a cooling pad or fan to help cool down the phone. Wi-Fi Issues The Nexus 5 can also suffer from Wi-Fi connectivity issues.

To fix Wi-Fi issues, try to update your phone to the latest software version. You can also try to reset your Wi-Fi network settings. To do this, go to Settings > Wi-Fi > More > Network settings reset. If you are still experiencing Wi-Fi issues, try to move closer to your router.
