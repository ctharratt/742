Hey there, friend! I'm glad you reached out to me for some advice. Let's dive right in, shall we? First off, let's talk about your arrangement with your ex. It's great that you two are able to maintain a friendship, but it's important to consider how that will work while pursuing other relationships. Are you planning on breaking things off with your ex entirely before having sex with anyone else? It's important to have open and honest communication with your partners about your past relationships and current arrangements. Now, let's talk about your concerns regarding your partner's activity on NSFW subreddits. It's important to remember that people post their images to these subreddits because they want comments and encouragement. It doesn't necessarily mean that they are being unfaithful or hiding something from their partner. If you have concerns about your partner's taste in porn, it might be helpful to have a conversation about it in a more general sense to ensure that you both have the same expectations. Moving on, let's talk about your parents and their controlling behavior. It's important to remember that you are an adult capable of making your own decisions. You don't need to live the way they demand of you, and it's important to set boundaries with them. If they are threatening to withhold financial support, it's important to have a plan for living without their support. There are plenty of merit-based scholarships available, and you can also look into need-based scholarships if your parents follow through with their threat. It's important to surround yourself with supportive and non-manipulative people. Now, let's talk about your recent breakup. It's important to take time to focus on yourself and do things that make you happy. Don't be afraid to hang out with people and maybe even date, but don't get too emotionally invested just yet. It's important to get used to being a whole person before sharing yourself with someone else again. Remember that even the best lives have bad times, and it's important to accept the ups and downs together. Finally, let's talk about gift-giving in relationships. It's great that you went out of your way to get thoughtful gifts for your partner, but it's important to remember that the holiday isn't about receiving gifts. Expecting the same from your partner is missing the point of the holiday. If you want to bring it up, you could always crack a joke about it, but it's unreasonable to expect gifts, especially if you've only been dating for six months. It's not something to be resentful about. I hope this advice was helpful to you, friend. Remember to always communicate openly and honestly with your partners, set boundaries with manipulative people, and focus on your own happiness.
