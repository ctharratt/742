As a hip hop fan, it's hard not to be aware of the ongoing feud between Meek Mill and Drake. It all started with Meek calling out Drake on Twitter for allegedly using a ghostwriter for his verse on their collaboration "R.I.C.O." From there, things escalated quickly, with Drake releasing two diss tracks ("Charged Up" and "Back to Back") and Meek responding with "Wanna Know." As someone who has been following hip hop for a while, I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed in Meek's behavior throughout this whole ordeal. While I understand that he had a legitimate issue with Drake allegedly using a ghostwriter, I don't think he handled it in the best way possible. Starting a public feud with one of the biggest musicians on the planet is never a good idea, especially when you don't have the same level of clout and influence. What's even more disappointing is the way Meek has acted since the feud began. He's come across as childish and immature, constantly taking shots at Drake on social media and in interviews. It's almost as if he's more interested in getting attention and stirring up drama than actually resolving the issue at hand. On the other hand, Drake has handled the situation with a level of maturity and professionalism that is commendable. He's responded to Meek's accusations with well-crafted diss tracks that not only showcase his lyrical ability but also demonstrate his ability to rise above the drama and focus on his music. One thing that has struck me throughout this whole ordeal is how easy it is to make fun of Drake. He's often portrayed as soft and emotional, and his music is often dismissed as "pop rap." But the truth is, Drake is one of the most successful and influential rappers of our time. He's managed to bridge the gap between hip hop and pop music in a way that few others have been able to do, and he's done it all while maintaining his authenticity and staying true to his roots. It's also worth noting that Drake has been a major force in bringing attention to smaller artists and helping to launch their careers. He's collaborated with up-and-coming rappers like Lil Baby and BlocBoy JB, and he's used his platform to promote lesser-known artists like Jorja Smith and dvsn. At the end of the day, I think it's important to remember that hip hop is a competitive genre. Feuds and rivalries are a part of the culture, and they can often lead to some of the most memorable moments in hip hop history. But it's also important to remember that there's a fine line between healthy competition and toxic behavior. In the case of Meek and Drake, I think it's clear that Meek has crossed that line. He's allowed his ego and his desire for attention to cloud his judgment, and he's come across as petty and immature. Drake, on the other hand, has handled the situation with grace and professionalism, and he's come out on top as a result. As hip hop fans, we should be celebrating the artistry and creativity of our favorite artists, not getting caught up in petty feuds and drama. Let's focus on the music and leave the drama behind.
