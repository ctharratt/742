Well, let me tell you, debt is a tricky thing. It can follow you around like a bad smell, and sometimes it feels like there's no way out. But fear not, my friend, for there are ways to navigate the murky waters of debt collection. Let's start with student loans. Now, these are a whole different animal. They have their own set of rules and regulations, and it can be tough to know what to do if you're struggling to make payments. One thing to keep in mind is that student loan debt doesn't just go away. Even if you pass the statute of limitations without any action being taken, you're still on the hook for that money. That being said, there are options for those who are struggling to make payments. Many lenders are willing to work with borrowers to come up with a repayment plan that works for both parties. It's mandated in some way, actually. So if you're experiencing hardship, don't be afraid to reach out and ask for help. Now, let's talk about old debts. If you're being contacted by a debt collector for a debt that's several years old, there are a few things to keep in mind. First of all, just because it's on your credit report doesn't mean the company that's contacting you now can or will remove it if you pay. This is such an old debt that they probably bought it for a few cents on the dollar. If you pay in full, it's a bonanza for them, but it may gain you nothing. Another thing to keep in mind is the statute of limitations. This varies by state, but in general, debt collectors have a limited amount of time to sue you for an old debt. After that time has passed, they can still try to collect all they want, but they've lost the ability to take legal action against you. So if you're being contacted about an old debt, it's worth checking to see if the statute of limitations has passed in your state. If it has, you can notify the three main credit reporting bureaus (Experian, Equifax, Transunion) that this debt is no longer reportable. Meanwhile, there is no reason to answer the collection agency's calls. Block them and you'll sleep better. Any dialogue with them will make your debt more "collectable" in their mind, and they'll get more persistent. Now, let's talk about lending money to family members. This is a tricky one, because on the one hand, you want to help out your loved ones. But on the other hand, money can be a source of tension and conflict in families. My policy is: I never lend money to family members. If a family member asks me to borrow money, I make it clear that I'm giving it to them. There's no reason to avoid my calls or miss family gatherings; they owe me nothing. In conclusion, debt can be a real pain in the you-know-what. But there are ways to deal with it. If you're struggling with student loan debt, reach out to your lender and see if they're willing to work with you. If you're being contacted about an old debt, check to see if the statute of limitations has passed in your state. And when it comes to lending money to family members, it's best to err on the side of caution and make it clear that you're giving the money as a gift, not a loan.
