Yo, what's up guys? It's your boy, and I'm back with some more thoughts on RuneScape. First off, let's talk about the Solomon store. I mean, come on, who doesn't love spending money on virtual items? It's like the ultimate flex, you know what I'm saying? And don't even get me started on the members-only stuff. That's where the real money is at. I mean, if you're not a member, what are you even doing with your life? And let's not forget about the merchandise. I mean, who wouldn't want to rock a RuneScape t-shirt or hat? It's like a badge of honor, letting everyone know that you're a true fan. But let's get real for a second. I know some of you are thinking, "Why are you so obsessed with spending money on virtual items?" Well, let me tell you, it's all about the moneyz and shit. I mean, sure, your clans might be cool and all, but they're not making you any money. And let's be real, money makes the world go round. So, if you want to be a baller in RuneScape, you gotta be willing to spend some cash. Now, let's talk about surveys. I know some of you might be thinking, "Why don't you just do a survey to find out what people want?" Well, let me tell you, surveys take way too much time. I mean, who has time to analyze all that data? And let's not forget about coming up with new rewards. That requires some serious brain power, and I'm not really good at putting myself in other people's shoes. Plus, have you seen those surveys from Jagex? Those are some professional surveys. I'm just a regular player, not an official employee. Speaking of surveys, have you guys heard about the positive association between how fast ice cream melts outside on 45Â° latitude and the number of shark attacks per year? I mean, who comes up with this stuff? But hey, it's always good to learn something new, right? Now, let's talk about my poll. I know some of you thought it was dull and lame, but how was I supposed to make a change without putting an answer that's like a hundred words long? Plus, the fact that people thought it was dull and lame tells us everything we need to know. And don't even get me started on the Ichtalin vs Amascut event. They really messed that one up. They could have done so much better. I mean, they should have put a video explaining what the event was all about. Instead, they just gave us a name and made it sound like some epic fighting event, and then we get there and it's just ghost collecting. Come on, Jagex, step up your game. But let's not forget that players voted on this event through Player Power. I think their mistake was not explaining things in more detail. They just scratched the surface, and now we have 4 out of 100 players who actually liked it. And let's not forget about Strawpoll. That thing looks horrible on mobile, and not just on mobile. I mean, come on, guys, we're in 2021. We need something that looks good on all devices. Now, let's talk about third-degree equations. I know some of you might be thinking, "How did you even come up with that equation?" Well, let me tell you, it took me two hours to make that thing. But it's original, so you couldn't have ever seen it before. And don't even get me started on how to determine the function's equation. You just transfer the dates on milestones into days from when the subreddit was created, and then use that as your X axis. The milestone numbers are your Y axis, and with some fancypants calculus online, you can determine the function's equation. And then you can determine when the function will be at 0 in the future. It's like magic, guys. And don't let anyone tell you that you can't do it. Even Einstein was told he was telling shit back in his day. But let's get back to RuneScape. We can say that those who visit this subreddit play the game for more than the average player does. And while I didn't say that this was relevant info, I already have more responses than I expected to have in such a short time window. And let me just say, I'm sorry about the survey requiring a login. I didn't think it would require that. A survey would require like 5-6 Strawpolls or something like that, and who has time for that? So, in conclusion, let's keep spending money on virtual items, let's hope Jagex steps up their game with events, and let's not forget about the power of third-degree equations. And if anyone has any criticism, I accept it. But let's not forget, we're all just trying to have some fun in RuneScape. Peace out, guys.
