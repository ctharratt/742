Hey there, friend. I stumbled upon your post and I couldn't help but feel like I was reading my own thoughts. It's crazy how similar our dispositions are, isn't it? I mean, I'm also a socially anxious person who prefers to stay in, and I'm constantly paranoid about my stability. It's like we're two peas in a pod. But here's the thing, I used to smoke and drink a lot too. And I mean, a lot. It was my way of coping with my stress and insecurities. I would get lost in a haze of smoke and alcohol, and for a while, it felt like everything was okay. But then, just like you, I would spiral down into a horrible self-loathing pattern. It was like an abusive friendship, one that had a great amount of good times but that very same thing, often at the very same time, made me feel terrible about myself, reminded me of all of my flaws and constantly undermined my confidence. I was less likely to go out, less likely to work on projects that I wanted to complete, less able to better myself and work on being the person who I know I want to become and all in all, just less. And that's when I realized that the drugs were the biggest crutches I seemed to have in order to take myself away from my stress and my insecurities. It was like I was running away from my problems instead of facing them head-on. So, like you, I decided to give up alcohol and weed. And let me tell you, it hasn't been easy. The first few days were the hardest. I felt like I was missing out on something, like I was losing a part of myself. But then I realized that the drugs were holding me back from becoming the person I wanted to be. They were like a weight that was dragging me down, preventing me from reaching my full potential. And that's when I decided to take control of my life. I started to focus on the things that really mattered to me. I started to work on my projects, to better myself, to become the person I knew I could be. And you know what? It felt amazing. It was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. Now, I'm not saying that you should give up drugs forever. That's a personal decision that only you can make. But what I am saying is that sometimes, we need to take a step back and reevaluate our lives. We need to ask ourselves if the things we're doing are really helping us or if they're just holding us back. And if you're going through a dark phase right now, just know that it will get better. I know it might not seem like it right now, but trust me, it will. You just need to take things one day at a time and focus on the things that really matter to you. One thing that really helped me was talking to someone. I went to group counseling and it was incredible. Seeing other people who were going through the same things as me was humbling and inspiring. It made me realize that I wasn't alone, that there were other people out there who were struggling just like me. And if counseling isn't your thing, maybe try volunteering. It might sound cheesy, but helping others can be an incredibly rewarding experience. It gives you a sense of purpose, a reason to get up in the morning. And who knows, maybe it will help you find your passion in life. So, my friend, I guess what I'm trying to say is that you're not alone. We all have our struggles, our insecurities, our demons. But it's up to us to face them head-on and become the best version of ourselves. It won't be easy, but trust me, it will be worth it.
