The Republican debates have become a complete and utter shitshow. It's like watching a bunch of toddlers fighting over a toy, except the toy is the presidency of the United States. The only people saying they'll vote for Hillary are the pundits who are angry at finding out that they're nowhere near as important as they thought they were. It's like they're throwing a tantrum because they're not getting their way. Rubio could have had accomplishments to point to now, but he'd rather whine about how much he hates his current job and spend his whole life campaigning for new ones on other people's dime. He's like a kid who's always looking for the next shiny object to distract him from the task at hand. He needs to focus on doing his job and stop worrying about his next political move. Cruz got crushed in the last debate for having zero Senate endorsements, had the "liberal donations" talking point shoved right back up his ass, and actually tried to attack Trump for saying people shouldn't be left to die in the streets. It's like he's living in a different universe where attacking someone for wanting to help people is a good thing. He needs to get his head out of the clouds and start focusing on the real issues facing our country. Luntz's focus groups always pick Rubio, but I'm not sure why. He's not the strongest candidate on the stage by any means. He was better in the first half of the debate, but Trump was better in the second half. Cruz was absolutely atrocious. He teed up a devastating attack ad for Hillary in the unlikely event he becomes the nominee by bashing Trump for not wanting to let people die in the streets. The "electability" talking point he kept going back to is laughable, coming from someone who's reduced to spinning third place into a moral victory every week and far too extreme to win a general election in this country. The circlejerk over how "reasonable" and "sane" Kasich is needs to end. The guy literally started beating the drums for war in North Korea. He wants to lock Apple execs in a room against their will until they unlock their phone. Half the shit he says is insane, but he knows how to phrase it in a folksy way that makes him sound moderate. Carson was a non-factor. He's already said his running mate will be a politician, which eliminates Carson. It's a combination of him blowing all of his opposition research on one exchange with Trump and his usual routine of running out of scripted answers halfway through. Trump started off shaky but is killing it down the stretch. Rubio has done the reverse. Cruz has been consistently terrible. It's the foreign policy questions that always seem to help him get back up after he loses steam at debates. He comes out smelling like roses while everyone else on the stage foams at the mouth for more war and more bombings. Somehow, the "Kasich is soooooo reasonable, he's a real adult!" circlejerk will keep going even after he suggested fighting a war against North Korea and detaining Apple executives against their will. Rubio needs to stop skipping his foreign policy briefings in favor of fundraising. He has no idea what he's talking about. Especially when he's getting crushed in his own party's primaries and might be the least electable candidate on the stage. I'll admit, Trump had a shaky start to the debate, but he's turning it around bigtime. I think foreign policy questions tend to help Trump because the rest of the field is just so unreasonable on it. Trump is reasonable on foreign policy. Rubio and Cruz are warmongers. The paleoconservatism movement is gaining traction among conservatives who are civic and territorial nationalists, fierce opponents of neoconservatism, and dovish on foreign policy. Some of the more diehard paleocons are Jesus-freak social conservatives, but as someone who isn't particularly religious, I don't agree with that part of it. The AnCap alternative is a convoluted mess of Dispute Resolution Organizations with different sets of laws and punishments that compete for "subscribers," but also would sign contracts with each other in case they'd have to cooperate. In practice, it would be a chaotic mess. Even though the current justice system is a monopoly, it's at least coherent. I was a right-libertarian. I've drifted more towards moderate paleoconservatism as the libertarian movement has largely moved towards anarchocapitalism. I personally find anarcho-anything unrealistic. I think we need things like a justice system, police/fire/military, borders, citizenship, and a consistent set of laws. I find the AnCap approach to these things to be overly complex and based on a naive view of human nature, just like any other form of anarchism. That being said, I still believe that capitalism works and that the state should be more limited and decentralized than it is now. I'm just not extreme enough to think abolishing it all is realistic or even desirable. FDR put Japanese-, German- and Italian-Americans in internment camps during World War II. If that wasn't bad enough, he pressured several Latin American countries to round up their own German-, Italian- and Japanese-by-heritage populations - including some German Jews who had fled the Nazis - and send them to the US to be interned. It's important to remember that even our most beloved presidents have made mistakes and done things that were morally wrong. We need to hold our leaders accountable for their actions and not let them get away with things just because they're in a position of power. In conclusion, the Republican debates have become a complete and utter shitshow. The candidates are more concerned with attacking each other than they are with discussing the real issues facing our country. We need to demand more from our leaders and hold them accountable for their actions. We need to focus on the issues that matter and not get distracted by petty squabbles and personal attacks. Only then can we hope to move our country forward and make it a better place for all Americans.
