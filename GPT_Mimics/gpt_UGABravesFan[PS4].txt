As a gamer, I have always been excited about new releases and updates in the gaming industry. However, with the recent trend of game developers releasing unfinished or lackluster games, my excitement has turned into skepticism. It seems like every new game that comes out is either a disappointment or requires additional purchases to make it worth playing. This is not what I want as a consumer, and I believe that game developers need to start prioritizing quality over profit. One game that I have been eagerly anticipating is Bad Company 3. Bad Company 2 is my favorite first-person shooter (FPS) of all time, and I have purchased every game in the series since then. However, the quality of these games has been steadily declining. Battlefield 3, 4, and Hardline were all mediocre at best, and Battlefront was a complete disappointment. If these games are any indication, Bad Company 3 will likely be another letdown. I understand that game development is a complex process, and creating a successful game is not easy. However, I believe that game developers need to take more time to ensure that their games are of high quality before releasing them. Rushing to meet deadlines and releasing unfinished games is not fair to consumers who have spent their hard-earned money on these products. Another issue that concerns me is the lack of online playability in some games. Twisted Metal: Black and SOCOM both had online components, but it is unclear whether or not we will be able to play these games online in the future. This is a problem because many gamers enjoy playing online with friends and other players. If a game does not have online playability, it significantly decreases its value. Furthermore, I believe that game developers need to be more transparent with their customers. Hello Games' No Man's Sky is a prime example of this. The game was marketed as having certain features and capabilities that were not present in the final product. This led to a lot of disappointment and frustration among gamers who had been eagerly anticipating the game. If game developers were more honest about what their games can and cannot do, it would prevent a lot of disappointment and backlash. In addition, I believe that game developers need to stop relying on DLC to fix their games. Destiny is a prime example of this. The game was released with a lot of problems and lacked content, but instead of fixing these issues for free, Bungie released DLC that players had to pay for. This is not fair to consumers who have already spent money on the game. Game developers need to take responsibility for their products and fix them for free if they are not up to par. Another issue that concerns me is the lack of innovation in some games. Call of Duty 4 and Modern Warfare 2 were both groundbreaking games that revolutionized the FPS genre. However, recent Call of Duty games have been lackluster and have not brought anything new to the table. A digital release of COD4/MW2 multiplayer would be a great way to bring back the excitement and innovation that these games brought to the industry. Finally, I believe that game developers need to prioritize communication with their customers. Many gamers have had issues with bans or lost accounts, and it is often unclear why these things happen. If game developers were more communicative with their customers, it would prevent a lot of frustration and confusion. In conclusion, as a gamer, I believe that game developers need to prioritize quality over profit. Rushing to meet deadlines and releasing unfinished games is not fair to consumers who have spent their hard-earned money on these products. Game developers need to take responsibility for their products and fix them for free if they are not up to par. They also need to be more transparent with their customers and prioritize communication. If game developers can do these things, they will create a better gaming industry for everyone.
