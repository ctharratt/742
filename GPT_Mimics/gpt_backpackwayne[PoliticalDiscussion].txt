As the presidential race heats up, the debates between the candidates become more and more important. I can't help but imagine what it would be like to see Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio go head to head. In my opinion, Clinton would wipe the floor with him. Rubio might even end up crying. On the other hand, a debate between Bernie Sanders and John Kasich would be more competitive, but I still think Sanders would come out on top. I would love to see these matchups happen. In fact, I think a Clinton/Sanders ticket would be unstoppable. Of course, that would be a bit of a mess, but I can't see how this current situation can be acceptable for a year. There are some important cases coming up in the next year that will surely end up with this fate. For example, let's say a case was brought to declare a gay marriage ban unconstitutional. The lower court ruled it unconstitutional, so it would be illegal to have a ban in just that district. But if gay marriage advocates wanted to have that decision made for the entire country, they would have to start over again with another case in another circuit. This seems like a waste of time and resources, but it's the reality we're facing without a ninth justice. Not having a ninth justice would basically cheat our country out of the decision the case was seeking. It seems very selfish to do just for political reasons. But since that justice is confirmed for life, they don't mind doing that just for a year. If gay marriage advocates wanted to have that decision made for the entire country, they would have to start over again with another case. They would have to start again in another circuit. So let's say they ruled 4-4 that the gay marriage ban is unconstitutional. Since the lower court ruled it unconstitutional, would gay marriage now be legal? It's an interesting question that I don't have the answer to. What I do know is that conservative sites intentionally twist facts and lie to make their point. Other sites may leave out facts to push their point, but outright lying is far worse than telling only part of the truth. As for the presidential race, I think Bernie Sanders' run for president is already pretty fantasy-land like. But some people take it even further and start posting tons of crap about Obama being part of the conspiracy for Hillary. It's ridiculous. Appealing to more than just their base is crucial for any candidate. Even John Huntsman last time around would have been a viable candidate, but Republicans just don't seem to see it. Sanity is not a good asset to have when running for the GOP nomination. All the good people in the past didn't get past a couple primaries, like John Huntsman. He wasn't extreme enough. As for who I'm voting for, I'm voting for the female candidate. To me, it's racist against white people to pick someone just because they are black or a woman. It's not the color of the person you pick, it's the person. A white person can fight for equality for all just as good as a black person. Gender, race, or sexual identity has nothing to do with it. At least it shouldn't. If people want to harp on first this or first that, more power to them. But it should have nothing to do with who you vote for. It's almost as bad as looking down and finding out you're in your underwear. People seem to forget things as soon as the next crazy thing comes up. It reminded me of one of those toy dolls that every time you squeeze it, it says the same thing. After it's regurgitated over and over and over, it all just sounds like crap. Foreign policy is the number one reason I'm voting for Hillary Clinton. She has more knowledge and experience than all of the other candidates put together. I'll give you more reasons tomorrow after I wake up and see this downvoted like 15 points. I'm already up past my bedtime. If you're looking to Reddit for guidance, you may as well put your Bernie bumper sticker on your car now. You're not going to get a picture of reality here. Most Hillary supporters are tired of arguing with people that have no interest in listening. We're just kind of riding it out until Super Tuesday and then we can start the real campaign. The media will blame anything for anything, whether it was the reason or not. That's what I mean about really bad timing. You did that in spite of the shutdown, not because of it. Sure, there is a mistake, but it's not the mistake that matters. It's how you handle it. And Rubio did not handle it well at all. Seriously, he looked like he was going to cry. This election has been next to impossible to predict. I'm not going to even try. But one thing is for sure, the debates are going to be crucial. Chris Christie basically hung Marco Rubio out to dry. It was like six minutes of television gold. You know the media is going to capitalize on it. I can't wait to see how the political humor shows make fun of this. It's going to be interesting to see the polls later this week. Even Donald Trump looked weak tonight. He even let Jeb Bush get the best of him. The audience was booing him big time. Trump seemed to be losing it tonight. I kind of have my doubts about his strong comeback over the next month. In conclusion, the debates are going to be crucial in this presidential race. It's important to look beyond the rhetoric presented on Reddit and watch the debates to learn more about the candidates. And as for who I'm voting for, I'm voting for the candidate with the most knowledge and experience in foreign policy.
