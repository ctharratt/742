I mean, seriously, do Japanese people even get paid? I heard they work "unofficially" for free because their economy is worse than people know. But what do you expect, it's Florida? Why would anyone live there if they aren't retired Jews or illegal immigrants? It's like, come on people, get with the program. And don't even get me started on that guy who wrote that thing in assembly. He was just lazy, couldn't be bothered to learn a high level language. It's like those ex-girlfriends who just want to dig for gold. They don't care about your life, they just want to use you until they're done. And speaking of things that are sketchy, why would anyone trust voting by mail? It just seems like it would be so easy to commit fraud. I mean, come on, people, use your brains. And did you see that footage? It was so poor quality compared to the US segments. It looked like it was from the Stone Age or something. It's like, come on, people, get with the times. And don't even get me started on co-workers. They can be the worst two-faced bullies. They'll smile and pretend to be your friend, but then they'll stab you in the back and try to get you fired. It's like, come on, people, be real. And why would anyone use a car when they're next to water? Just use a boat, people. It's not rocket science. And speaking of science, did you know that Jupiter is why we have an asteroid belt? It protected Earth more than Jupiter, but we wouldn't have the asteroid belt without our giant planet. It's like, come on, people, learn some science. And don't even get me started on Hubble's observations. They were WRONG! They only told us that the Universe was expanding, but they said nothing about that expansion continuously accelerating! This made Einstein forget his original idea of a cosmological constant, and he thought his perfect theory was wrong. We later learned in the late 90's he was right, and he should have continued his work. He spent thousands of hours trying to make a unified theory and all that was lost because of Hubble. Technically, he was right the first time. He ain't wrong. And speaking of being wrong, it's ironic that he uses the devil to explain things, because that means we are driven by nature, and there is no god. It's like, come on, people, use your brains. And don't even get me started on critics. You can't trust just one source of critics, people. Even his own examples are bad. I mean, who thinks that Ben Stiller zipping up his own ball sack is considered everything going his way? And what about Jim Carrey? He was a unconfident bank clerk and comedy was he became amazing wearing a Mask. He also was a jackass who got humiliated by telling the truth, interestingly completely opposite of Ricky Gervais character where he could lie, and nobody else could. Ricky was a God among the people, that's the complete opposite of his analysis. If this was a debate, I would have fried him. I think his analysis is wrong and biased. And speaking of biased, Rodney Dangerfield and Gilbert Gottfried have characters more pathetic than any British comedians. I don't see everything working out for Louis C.K. in his stuff either. English humor tends to have a lot of dry dad joke quips. American humor tends to have dialogue that is actual laugh out loud comedy. Amy Phoehler liked him. And don't even get me started on the cosmological constant. It was needed because without it, the Universe would collapse on itself. There is some type of force that is pushing the Universe apart, and Einstein was right. When Hubble found out it was expanding, that's fine, but there's still some force that's required to explain why it is expanding. I have no idea why he stopped on this research other than he must have assumed that this expansion was a Universal constant, which we know it isn't. It's a shame he stopped work on it. And speaking of shame, the Mormon religion is evil and disgusting. Rich kids just wanted to be an actress, and Daddy made it happen. Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian released sex tapes, and used their money to generate publicity about how they released sex tapes. Think about that. How can we give money to them instead of a fake religion? And don't even get me started on gambling. It's a racket. It's always rigged. The math isn't hard. Gambling is a racket. It's always rigged. And speaking of rigged, the Bible was the most fucked up thing I ever read. It taught me about how life is harsh and you can't trust anyone. People will murder you, your own God will order you to murder people, and nobody cares. Nobody cares, not even your own God. Life is a joke. And don't even get me started on cannibals. They claim the meat doesn't taste that good. We have bred animals for thousands of years to taste good. You are at the ocean. You have a billion fish to eat. Catch fish. The odds are not worth it. The math isn't hard. And speaking of math, it's not hard to spit some generic happy bullshit. The real question is, who paid 60 Minutes to make the story? They didn't come up with that term until Tetris? Casuals. And don't even get me started on magicians. You obviously have never seen a close-up magician. Look drunk and clumsy. Learn slight of hand. In conclusion, people need to use their brains and stop being so gullible. Life is harsh and nobody cares. It's a joke. But if you learn some science and slight of hand, you might just survive.
