Alright, let's get into it. First off, can we talk about how Gregg's stopped warming up their oven baked products to save on tax? I mean, come on, that's just ridiculous. And don't even get me started on Devon savouries, they're overrated mate. Hills, on the other hand, should have stuck with acting and reading an autocue in an interesting voice. He's genuinely good at that stuff. But let's move on to more pressing matters, like Reddit. Click on a link and you get this shit and freak a little. It's diversionary politics. It's shit. It holds our country back. And don't even get me started on Hamas. Sure, they don't represent the totality of Palestinian political views, but if you want to get rid of them, you have to start seeking alternative political solutions. And that isn't possible while there isn't a peace-minded political solution. Corbyn recognizes that the best solution to resolving problems is to peacefully negotiate political solutions and it's better to start doing that sooner than later. He will talk to every side in order to achieve that. That is a reasoned and intelligent approach to conflict resolution. Now, let's talk about fascism. British people have consistently fought fascists in this country, it's a long standing tradition. The 1943 group, the 1962 group, AFA fought political street wars with the fascists for decades. And sure, they had stopped at a service station, but that's hardly provocative. Britain has continuously had small fascist political groups throughout the 20th century. Neo-Nazis are politically powerless and easily marginalized, Britain isn't particularly fond of fascism. The highest electoral result they ever achieved was 1.9%, they consistently lost money standing for parliament. Britain First are the latest variant of the same movement and are now controlled by a Presbyterian fascist nutjob in Northern Ireland. They omit to mention the people running Britain First formerly ran the BNP and they also forget to mention they are dyed in the wool Hitler worshipping Neo-Nazis, who have been using simplistic patriotic memes to gain public appeal without mention they favor the Roman salute to the royal wave and they want to remove the democratic process and all those other nasty things the general public wouldn't understand. The new Nazis obfuscate their true political identity by failing to mention their personal adoration for Adolf Hitler. These attempts at populism are hardly unique. In Germany, they have long since lost the bonehead haircuts and now offer vegan cooking courses. And speaking of politics, can we talk about the government paying towards faith schools? I mean, sure, they provide a societal function, but since they have gone out of their way to contribute to UK society, then they deserve to be able to teach their position on God. No one is forced to believe in God. You can choose not to believe it and still go along with it if you like. And where are all the atheist schools that have been built? It probably wouldn't be that hard for the government to justify taking them over, perhaps with some compensation to cover the small proportion of capital costs that were paid by the faith group in the first place. It would be expensive to impose this "censorship plan" regardless since the land the schools are on is likely owned by the church. Compulsory purchase would be fought hard in the courts. So who is paying? Wouldn't it be far simpler to simply create a network of atheist schools? No, it wouldn't, because that would involve atheists putting their hands in their pockets and they don't seem to be willing to put their money where their mouths are. Seems happy to spend everyone else's money to impose their opinions on others. State-run schools to a strict atheist code. And you expect the churches who made such major investments in British education to continue supporting schools that specifically exclude their ideology. So let's assume these 7000 faith schools simply close up and the land sold in your atheist pipedream. It costs 14 million pounds to build a new school. Who's paying? And let's not forget about the whole debate about gods existence or otherwise. It's entirely unfair that scientific demands are made for one side but the other side doesn't have to produce, it's especially hypocritical when it's the side that claims to value scientific endeavor. As it stands, the atheist community hasn't offered a single piece of evidence that gods don't exist. Not a jot. It should be taught that religion is, in fact, a bad thing which has led to the worst atrocities in history. A tool only used to control and divide mankind and make them do unspeakable things. The Holocaust, the Great Leap Forward, the Cold War, World War One, World War Two: religion? Hundreds of millions of people dead, all in the last one hundred years, all related to state expansion or political ideology. So, in conclusion, let's focus on the real issues at hand and not get bogged down in petty arguments. Let's work towards peaceful solutions and strive for a better future for all. And let's not forget to steal bollards and wizard hats while ridiculously inebriated, because that's what adventure is all about.
