Hey there, fellow runners! I just had to respond to this post because I totally disagree with the idea that fuel doesn't matter when it comes to achieving your goals. Trust me, I've been there. I used to think that I could just eat whatever I wanted and still perform well on my runs, but boy was I wrong. Once I started paying more attention to my nutrition and fueling properly before and after my runs, I saw a huge improvement in my performance and overall energy levels. Now, onto the topic of running attire. I have to say, I totally agree with the idea of wearing shorts on top of running tights. Not only does it look more aesthetically pleasing, but it also provides an extra layer of warmth and protection during colder runs. And speaking of cold runs, does anyone else struggle with cold arms at the beginning of their runs? I used to have this problem all the time, but I found that doing a few pushups before my run helps get my blood flowing and keeps me warmer throughout the entire run. As for running in sketchy areas, I totally understand the feeling of wanting to speed up and get out of there as quickly as possible. But remember, safety always comes first. If you don't feel comfortable running in a certain area, it's better to find a different route or run with a buddy. Now, let's talk about post-race fuel. I don't know about you guys, but I always look forward to that post-race meal. And let me tell you, pizza is definitely one of my go-to's. It's the perfect combination of carbs, protein, and deliciousness. But don't forget to also refuel with some water and electrolytes to help your body recover properly. And finally, let's talk about training for a marathon. It's definitely a big undertaking, but if you have a good base and are willing to put in the work, I believe anyone can do it. Just make sure to follow a proper training plan and listen to your body. And remember, it's not just about the physical training, but also the mental preparation. Stay positive and believe in yourself, and you can accomplish anything. So there you have it, my fellow runners. Keep pushing yourself, fuel properly, and stay safe out there. Happy running!
