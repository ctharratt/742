I have to say, the hate that Jennifer Lawrence gets on Reddit is just ridiculous. I mean, sure, not everyone has to like her, but the level of vitriol that some people spew towards her is just uncalled for. And the worst part is that a lot of it seems to stem from her speaking out against the Fappening and calling it what it is: sexual assault. I mean, seriously, can you blame her for that? But of course, a lot of people on Reddit were more interested in searching out those stolen pictures and whacking it than they were in respecting someone's privacy and consent. And when Lawrence had the audacity to call them out on it, they freaked out and started hating on her. And now, of course, they're all on this "OMG she's so fake and a bad actress" train. But you can pinpoint the day when the flip in attitudes happened, so it's more after-the-fact justification. It's worse because you're dealing with the JLaw haters, but because RedLetterMedia hates her too, you're dealing with JLaw haters mixed with obnoxious RLM fans. And don't even get me started on that whole "rude to the reporter" thing. Lawrence was doing a Q&A and the reporter was filming her while asking the question. Lawrence only said what she did because it's only common courtesy to look at someone when interviewing them. He had perfect English. He also made fun of her by saying on Facebook that she only said that because she was on her period. I mean, seriously, what is wrong with people? And it's not just the JLaw hate that's annoying. It's the way that Reddit turns on movies and actors so quickly. One minute they're all praising a movie to high heaven, and the next they're tearing it apart and calling it boring. And don't even get me started on the way they treat actors. Ryan Reynolds is a perfect example of this. They all act like they've been fans of his for years, but if you asked them two years ago, they'd just say he's an idiot who only does rom-coms. And now that Deadpool is a success, they're all acting like they knew it was going to be great all along. And don't even get me started on the way they treat directors. Christopher Nolan is a perfect example of this. I like his movies, but goddamn it, Reddit acts like he's some sort of god among men. And if you say anything negative about him or his movies, they get all flustered and start downvoting you. And it's not just Nolan. They do this with every director who makes a movie that they like. They act like they're the only ones who "get it" and that anyone who doesn't like the movie is just stupid or doesn't understand it. And don't even get me started on the way they treat women in Hollywood. It's like they can't handle the idea of a woman being successful or having an opinion. They tear down actresses like Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Watson for speaking out about feminism, and they act like it's some sort of personal attack on them. And don't even get me started on the way they treat movies with female leads. They act like it's some sort of political statement or agenda, when really it's just a movie with a female lead. And if the movie isn't perfect, they tear it apart and act like it's proof that women can't carry a movie. It's just ridiculous. And the worst part is that they don't even realize how toxic and hateful they're being. They act like they're just having fun and joking around, but really they're just being assholes. And don't even get me started on the way they treat people who disagree with them. If you say anything negative about a movie or actor that they like, they get all defensive and start attacking you. They act like their opinions are the only ones that matter and that anyone who disagrees with them is just stupid or doesn't understand. It's just sad, really. Reddit could be a great place to discuss movies and TV shows, but instead it's just a toxic cesspool of hate and negativity. And until people start realizing that their opinions aren't the only ones that matter, it's not going to get any better.
