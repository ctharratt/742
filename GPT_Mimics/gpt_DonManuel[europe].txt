Ah, the beauty of naiveté. It's a powerful thing, isn't it? The idea that we can come together as Europeans, of all nations, and unite for a common cause. It's a beautiful thought, but is it realistic? Of course not. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try. I mean, let's face it, doing nothing would be truly naïve. We can't just sit back and watch as the world around us crumbles. We have to take action, even if it's just a small step in the right direction. And speaking of small steps, have you ever been to (Eastern!-)Crete or other islands in the Mediterranean? It's quite surprising how blood revenge is still a practiced habit in some areas. It's a reminder that even in our modern world, some traditions and beliefs still hold strong. But let's not forget about the bigger picture. It's ignorant to black out the whole Middle East as "unsafe." Sure, there are dangers and risks, but chances are high that if somebody leaves, they have a reason other than economic circumstances. We can't just turn a blind eye to the suffering of others. And let's not forget about the refugee crisis. It's not just the UK that's deporting refugees. Every other country doing the same should be criticized just as much. We can't just push the problem onto someone else and hope it goes away. But let's not get too caught up in the negative. There are positive steps being taken, like France's new regulation that will offer interesting new views. Suddenly, those who can afford current food prices will almost directly support those who can't, basically without any further investment from the social system for that specific process. It's a small step, but it's a step in the right direction. And speaking of steps in the right direction, have you heard about the United Human Organization? It's an idea that's been floating around for a while now, and it's gaining traction. The concept is to replace the United Nations Organization with a more inclusive and representative body that takes into account the needs and desires of all humans, not just those of certain nations or groups. Of course, there are those who would argue that patriotism is still important in a globalized world. But I would argue that it's an outdated concept that leads to inbreeding and a lack of genetic diversity. We must learn to appreciate increased genetic variety, otherwise all humans outside Africa will further degenerate on all levels. Fuck patriotism. And let's not forget about the elephant in the room: Russia. It's amazing how some people still think that Russia is strong with Putin. Of course, it's easy to see why they would think that. After all, the Kremlin is a master of propaganda and manipulation. But we must not be fooled. Russia and Putin are not poor victims. They are aggressors who seek to undermine the stability and security of the world. But let's not end on a negative note. There is hope for the future. We can come together as Europeans, of all nations, and unite for a common cause. We can take small steps in the right direction, like France's new regulation. We can work towards a more inclusive and representative global organization, like the United Human Organization. And we can reject outdated concepts like patriotism and embrace the diversity and richness of the human experience. So let's not be naïve, but let's not be cynical either. Let's be hopeful and optimistic, and let's work towards a better future for all humans, not just those of certain nations or groups.
