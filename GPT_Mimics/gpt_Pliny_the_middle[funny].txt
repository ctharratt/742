Hey guys. I just wanted to chime in on some of the topics that have been floating around on Reddit lately. First off, can we talk about these master mechanics with huge dicks? I mean, I get it, tractors and agricultural equipment need to be lowered to the ground, but do we really need to bring penis size into the equation? It just seems unnecessary. And while we're on the topic of rural living, can we talk about the urban sprawl? I hate it just as much as the next guy. Every exit seems to have a never-ending strip mall labyrinth. It's like, can we just let people live their lives and not have to deal with all this unnecessary development? But of course, the bureaucrats always want to regulate everything. More regulations, more taxes, it's like they just want to penalize people who need to haul trailers and live in the country. And don't even get me started on the Reddit anti-rural circle-jerk. Just because some people drive large trucks doesn't mean they're compensating for something. Some people actually need to haul horse trailers and backhoes, you know? And speaking of ridiculous things, can we talk about those racist license plates? What kind of moron would even think that's okay? And don't even get me started on the people who wear $300+ basketball shoes in the hood. Like, really? That's supposed to be aspirational to wealth? Give me a break. And while we're on the topic of fashion, can we talk about cowboy boots? I mean, sure they look cool, but they're terrible to work in while on your feet. And yet, people still wear them while not working on horseback. It just doesn't make sense to me. But let's move on to something a little more lighthearted, like boat shoes. I mean, they're called boat shoes for a reason, right? And don't even get me started on the back right window that's made of plywood. I mean, sure it's carefully fitted and sealed, but it's still plywood. And speaking of things that don't make sense, can we talk about the obesity epidemic? I mean, sure it's a problem, but comparing it to a disability is unfair to both the disabled and the obese. And yet, people still get outraged over it. It's like, can we just let people live their lives and not judge them for their weight? But of course, there's always someone who wants to judge. Like that girl who yelled at me for referring to a Mexican guy as a Mexican. I mean, sure he could have been Spanish, but he was from Juarez, Valencia. It's like, can we just be culturally sensitive without being ignorant? And speaking of ignorance, can we talk about the Europeans waking up? I mean, sure they have their downvotes, but it's like, can't we all just get along? And don't even get me started on that Coke ad. I haven't seen anyone complaining about it, but apparently there are people out there condemning the supposed ad haters. It just doesn't make sense to me. But you know what does make sense? Homecooked meals. My girlfriend and I make them almost every night of the week. We love cooking, but we don't love paying $15 for $5 worth of ingredients. And don't even get me started on the shipping already shipped produce. It's just not the greenest of ideas. But you know what is a good idea? Reposting that beautiful strong black rhino meme. I mean, who doesn't love a good meme? And speaking of memes, can we talk about that NASA one-upping meme? It's like, can't we just appreciate both NASA and SpaceX for their contributions to space exploration? And finally, can we talk about regret? It's like, sometimes you just wish you had done things differently the first time around. Like that time I graduated at 30 and had a professor who wanted to hang out with me on the weekend. It was just weird, you know? But hey, at least I can look back on it and laugh.
