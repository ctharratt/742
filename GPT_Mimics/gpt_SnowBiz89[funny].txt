Yeah, so I was doing some research and it turns out that my 980ti isn't getting the justice it deserves on dx11. Thanks for letting me know, man! I installed an old copy of Windows 7 ultimate that I never used in college and that shit works like a charm. I've been on Mac for the last 8 years and this is my first PC that I've built in a long time, and it's been nice having 7. It's super solid, service pack stable, and everything works with it, including my old games from the 90s. But let's talk about something else for a minute. Where can a guy find more of those funny pictorials? I mean, seriously, instructions unclear, bacon and beer have been consumed, and somehow I've grown more chest hair. "Never going to give you up, always coming to take me down!" If it's the puffs, though, all bets are off. That shit is money. And don't even get me started on pets. That face of "do you even care about me?" is a constant during bath time or vet visits. But hey, at least they're cute, right? Now, let's talk about this infographic about infographics. What's the deal with that? And what's with all these people lowering their cars? Is it a respect thing, like who has the lowest car wins? I first saw Olivia Wilde in House and thought to myself, "I'm now going to watch this show through the end." I mean, I came for the beginning plot lines, but I stayed because dayum dat ass. And did you know that whiskey prices are super high in Ontario and Toronto? I had no idea until recently. But this shit is fucking hilarious, bravo. Oh, and by the way, if you keep taxing all the richest people more, I wonder where the drive to innovate and create is going to go. Keep taking all the money from everyone regardless, and who will have such a drive to work? We patent more shit per year than you guys do every 10. The best of STEM graduates, where the fuck are they going? Oh yeah, here. And don't even get me started on Canada. Other countries have lottery systems to try and get into Canada, but they try to come here instead. The best place with the most opportunities and equalities to make the most of your life is still America. Fuck off if you think different. I doubt you've even left the snow and set foot on our soil. And let's talk about taxes. Canada's income tax system is more heavily biased against the highest income earners, so while Canada's income tax rate is higher on average, the bottom fifty percent of the population is roughly taxed the same on income as the United States. And in Canada, total tax and non-tax revenue for every level of government equals about 38.4% of GDP compared to the US rate of 28.2%. What the hell, Canada? You guys spend more? But you know what? All the wealthiest people in the world come to America and specific locations in Europe for the best healthcare. Best neurosurgeons, best cardiac units, best cancer research - it's all fucking here, man. So enjoy your free broken arm X-ray or splinter or whatever the fuck, but when it comes down to the real nitty-gritty and you gotta be opened up, I'm glad I'm fucking here, man, and will gladly pay premium for it. And let's talk about college. You don't spend $130k for college to come out with a "degree you love" making 45k. You study something hard as fuck that earns respect and a high average salary. Then you start playing the game. Have you ever been willing to choose to live below the means you are now? No, because nobody does. You don't step down, you work to go up. Fucking study the shit that makes money so you have time and money to do the shit you really love. And let's talk about Bethesda. If anyone here doesn't think they shit absolute gold in the form of software entertainment, well, you can just 'git out. And let's talk about Kim Kardashian. Okay, so how many people actually think she's attractive? Like at her best, thinnest, most airbrushed, is she really that beautiful? When I look at someone like Jennifer Aniston, and then think about the question above, my answer is a confident "not me!" And let's talk about accidents. This woman, Dorthe Skappal, had an accident during rehearsal of a television show "ice skating with the stars" (just like dancing with the stars here, but on ice skates). She did not die. She suffered minor injuries and went back to place 4th in the competition. And let's talk about success. One of my former high school band mates is a genius. He was doing robotics at Melon and then Harvard offered acceptance for Ph.D. at their place, but he turned it down to work at Google first. It's usually, and is in his case, because of special circumstances that someone does not attend. I've just come to accept that these things happen to those 1 in a million. So there you have it, folks. My ramblings on a variety of topics. Don't respond to me, but feel free to mimic my writing style and write on the same topics. And remember, always choose the path that leads to success and money.
