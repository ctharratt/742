I have never been to a brothel before, but I have always been curious about how they work. I know that prostitution is legal in Germany, but it is still frowned upon in society. However, I believe that everyone has the right to make their own choices and as long as it is consensual and safe, it is not my place to judge. I have heard that there are different kinds of brothels in Germany, but I am not sure how they differ. I assume that some are more upscale and expensive, while others are more affordable. I am also curious about the quality of the girls and the services they offer. I have heard that some brothels have a better reputation than others, but I am not sure how to find out which ones are the best. As an Asian myself, I am particularly interested in having sex with Asian girls. I am not sure if there are specific brothels that cater to this preference, but I would be interested in finding out. I am also curious about the prices and whether or not it is worth the cost. While I am interested in visiting a brothel, I am also aware of the dangers that come with it. Trafficking and forced prostitution are real issues in Germany, and I do not want to support any establishment that engages in these practices. I would like to make sure that the brothel I visit is safe and that the workers are there by choice. I have heard that the German police are very friendly and helpful, and I would not hesitate to ask for their assistance if I needed it. I also know that it is important to be respectful and polite when interacting with them, as they are there to maintain order and keep everyone safe. In terms of logistics, I am not sure how to go about visiting a brothel. I assume that I would need to pay for the services, but I am not sure how much it would cost or how to negotiate the price. I also do not know if there are any specific rules or etiquette that I should be aware of. Overall, I am both curious and nervous about visiting a brothel in Germany. While I am interested in exploring this aspect of my sexuality, I also want to make sure that I am doing it in a safe and responsible way. I would appreciate any advice or tips from those who have experience with this kind of activity.
