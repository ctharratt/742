I recently purchased a JET Water Pipe and let me tell you, it's a game changer. This thing hits like a dream and is practically indestructible. I've had it for a couple of months now and even after the new piece "honeymoon" phase, I still love it and couldn't be happier with my purchase. One thing to note is that it's important to clean it properly. The only thing you should use to clean it is iso, as any kind of detergent will do permanent damage to it. They briefly advertised it as dishwasher safe, but it's definitely not. So, make sure to take care of it properly to ensure it lasts a long time. In terms of price, it's definitely worth the investment. When compared to glass pieces of the same price, the JET Water Pipe is well worth it. It hits like you're breathing in air and has some real weight behind it. It doesn't feel how you think it would, but that's part of what makes it so great. Now, let's talk about 3D printers. They're definitely a bit pricey at the moment, but if you're just looking to make small parts and things, I'd highly recommend the ZeePro. It seems to be the highest quality cheap 3D printer on the market at the moment. Both PLA and ABS plastics are pretty cheap, so it's really the printer that'll put the dent in your wallet. If you do end up getting a 3D printer, I recommend switching over to OctoPrint no matter what printer you have just for ease of use and convenience. And if you're worried about the cost of proprietary cartridges, don't be. When compared to other printers such as Makerbot, the proprietary cartridges are actually very cheap. I recently made a new cooling fan for my PC using my school's 3D printer. It hardly took any PLA plastic at all, so it didn't cost me anything. The only downside was having to make up an alternative use for it to get the tech department's approval. But, it was well worth it in the end. If you're interested in getting some billet aluminum pieces, I've heard from everyone that has them they don't restrict draw too much and are well worth the investment. Also, if you plan on getting 3 or more, just go for 5. The price is only like a $20 or $30 difference at that point, so it's well worth it to just get the extra few. Plus, even if you don't end up using all 5, you can get a couple of different colors, so you'll never get bored of the setup. I recently came up with an idea for a 3D design class project. It kind of seems like one of those convergent ideas that many people "come up with" themselves at the same time. I have seen mention of it around in various places, but as far as I know, I'm the first one who actually did it. My teacher thought it was a fan for my desktop, but it's actually something much cooler. Overall, I highly recommend investing in a JET Water Pipe and a 3D printer. They may seem like big purchases, but they're well worth it in the end. The JET Water Pipe hits fantastically and is practically indestructible, while a 3D printer allows you to create all sorts of cool things. Just make sure to take care of them properly and you'll be set for a long time.
