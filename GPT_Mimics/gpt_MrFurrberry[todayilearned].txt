I have to say, I'm glad to see someone else talking about the history of money and how we're in uncharted waters. It's a topic that doesn't get enough attention, in my opinion. I think it's important for people to understand how money works and how it has evolved over time. The gold standard is something that has been around for thousands of years, and for good reason. Gold and silver don't corrode easily, so they last a long time compared to other metals. That's why they have been a standard of sorts for so long. But in today's global economy, we have to use computers and digital currencies. There simply isn't enough gold and silver to have in the hands of people as real wealth. I remember when my mother was teaching ESL at a prestigious university and she saw her students high-fiving each other after class. They were mostly middle eastern students, and most of them were Saudis. It was a fascinating experience for her, and it just goes to show how different cultures can be. Speaking of interesting experiences, I remember when I opened my first checking account and the teller accidentally put my social security number in my initial deposit. I didn't realize it until I left the bank and looked at my receipt. I couldn't help but laugh at the thought of being worth a few hundred million dollars for a day. Of course, the bank corrected the mistake within 24 hours, but it's a fun story to tell. But let's get back to the topic of money. High fructose corn syrup has had a huge impact on our society, and not necessarily a good one. It's one of the reasons why the norm for a woman's weight is now around 150 pounds. It's a shame that we have to deal with these kinds of issues, but it's the reality of the world we live in. Another issue that we're facing is the value of our currency. If everything was rounded up to 5 cents, we could start making the nickel out of zinc. This is something that might happen soon anyways, as the price of copper might soon be greater than the composition of the 75% copper nickel. It's interesting to think about how our currency is changing and evolving over time. Speaking of currency, I remember reading about a millionaire who bought something like 1 million in US nickels. His theory was that they would always be worth 1 million, as per the denomination, and they could be worth more for their metal content later. It's a risky investment, but it's also a fascinating one. But let's move on to a more serious topic - hemophilia. It's a rough thing to understand, and if not for the internet, most people would never meet a bleeder. The only people outside of doctors who know anything about it are those who read a book about a boy who couldn't stop bleeding in 5th grade. But that's a very misleading portrayal of the condition. The truth is that I will stop bleeding - I just bleed longer. The real issue is when I bleed into my joints, which is the most common issue. The iron and WBC's in blood like to eat away at cartilage, which can cause a lot of problems. It's not an easy life, but I've learned to cope with it over time. One of the positive things about having hemophilia is that it has allowed me to become introspective. It has also caused me a lot of boredom, which is probably to blame for my jaded attitude. I'm a very compassionate person, but I'm also a huge asshole. It's just the way I am. But one thing that really bothers me is the misinformation that is out there about hemophilia. For example, ABC's show "Lies and Secrets" said that hemophilia is the nasty bi-product of incest. That's simply not true, and it's frustrating to see such misinformation being spread around. It's important for people to understand the truth about hemophilia and other conditions. Another issue that I've had to deal with is the cost of treatment. The treatments for hemophilia can be brutal, and I wouldn't wish them on my worst enemy. Thankfully, there are now new treatments available, but they are so expensive that most insurance companies won't cover them. I had to go through three months of appeals just to get the medication I needed, and even then, I had to get it straight from the drug maker. It's frustrating to see how much money is being made off of hemophilia. The current cost to insurance companies for one dose of medication is around $3,000, and it only lasts for two days at most. It's a big business, and it's unfortunate that so many people have to suffer because of it. But despite all of the challenges that come with having hemophilia, I'm grateful for the experiences that I've had. It has allowed me to see the world in a different way, and it has given me a unique perspective on life. I wouldn't wish hemophilia on anyone, but I'm also grateful for the lessons that it has taught me. In conclusion, the history of money and the challenges of living with hemophilia are two very different topics, but they both have something in common - they are often misunderstood. It's important for people to understand the truth about these issues and to be informed about the challenges that others face. We live in a complex world, and it's up to us to educate ourselves and to be compassionate towards others.
