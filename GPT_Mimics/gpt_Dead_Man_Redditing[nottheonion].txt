Well, well, well, here we are again. Let's talk about vaccines and autism, shall we? I mean, it's not like we haven't talked about this before, but I guess some people just can't get enough of it. So, let me just start by saying that I do not, under any circumstances, believe that vaccines cause autism. I mean, come on, people, let's use some common sense here. The scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports the fact that vaccines are safe and effective. But, of course, there are always going to be those who refuse to believe the facts and instead cling to their own misguided beliefs. Now, I know some of you are probably thinking, "But, what about the link between autism and vaccinations?" Well, let me tell you, the most likely explanation for this link is that the autism symptoms are exacerbated by the vaccine side effects. I mean, it's not rocket science, people. And don't even get me started on the whole anti-vax movement. It's just ridiculous. The entire modern anti-vax movement started when the majority of parents whose child had autism reported independently that their children's symptoms coincided with their vaccinations. Doctors rushed to find the cause which led to Wakefield's horrible report that McCarthy circlejerks and the such preach by. However, the explanation I gave you could realistically serve as that cause. And while we're on the topic of medicine, let's talk about homeopathy. Now, I know some of you are probably rolling your eyes right now, but hear me out. Homeopathy is a general term, much like the way this article uses it, to define using natural remedies. Homeopathic medicine is the practice of using diluted elements to treat illness. I'm fuzzy on whether the elements used are the holistic remedies like using witch hazel, or if it is a diluted form of what they believe is afflicting you in the first place. The latter seems more probable. So, homeopath = natural remedy. Homeopathic medicines = probable bs that doesn't work. But, let me tell you, I use several homeopaths daily. Not once is it recommended to dilute beyond the purchased dosage unless needed to decrease effectiveness. I don't know where you get this idea that homeopathy is about taking useful natural items and diluting them beyond their usefulness. It seems clear you don't like them and that's fine, but if you have to make things up to attack it then you don't have much ground in an argument. Its not endorsing it at all it is just describing it. Not once in the article is it recommended. Well, obviously you dilute them to certain levels. Pure witch hazel would be extremely painful if applied undiluted but there is no reason to dilute them past their practical usage. No idea what you are referring to. Homeopathy is defined by using natural ingredients. It has no standard for diluting them to inactive. This article doesn't even endorse homeopathy it just explains it. The majority of baby remedies are rooted in homeopathy. Gripe water, butt paste, witch hazel, chamomile, and lavender are pre req's for every good parents medicine cabinet. How is this onion worthy? And while we're at it, let's talk about the theory of evolution. Now, I know some of you are probably thinking, "What do you know about evolution?" Well, let me tell you, I know enough to know that it's not a law. A law is undisputed, a theory is not yet proven to be undisputed. The laws of physics cannot be broken and can be repeatedly demonstrated without variance. The theory of evolution cannot be repeated as of yet so it is disputable even though all evidence supports it. While my statement does lean towards the hypothesis side, the fact that it is being researched means it technically could be defined as a theory. But, of course, there are always going to be those who confuse theory with law. A theory is an idea that has not been either completely disproven or conclusively proven. The laws within them have been proven but that does not mean that the theories as a whole are proven as a result. Again, a law is the highest level of authority. Evolution is a theory because you cannot accurately predict what will happen to that fish in the water. You can make guesses based upon the variables present but even in the best circumstances you cannot predict what will happen, hence it is still a theory. Relativity is different. Inside of it there are laws but they do not encompass the larger content. For the most part it still remains a theory because of the lack of information available at this time. And finally, let's talk about the difference between a direct link and a casual link. A direct link would mean that one thing causes another, a casual link means they are in some way related. There has not been any specific studies done as of yet. So, anybody who honestly believes there is a causal link between vaccines and autism is just plain wrong. I mean, come on, people, let's use some common sense here. The scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports the fact that vaccines are safe and effective. In conclusion, I hope I have shed some light on these topics for you. I mean, it's not like I'm an expert or anything, but I do have some common sense. And, let's face it, sometimes that's all you need. So, let's all just take a deep breath and try to use some common sense when it comes to these issues. Thank you for listening to my ramblings.
