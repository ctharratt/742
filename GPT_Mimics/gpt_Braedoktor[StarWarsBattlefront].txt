I have to admit, I'm feeling pretty cynical about the upcoming release of Star Wars Battlefront. I mean, sure, DICE has promised us a lot, but can we really trust them to deliver? They've already counted out so much, it's hard to believe we'll even have any ships to fly. And what about Coruscant? Is it technically part of the original trilogy? It only appears once in the celebration scene, after all. And let's not forget that DICE LA would probably make a better product, but at the end of the day, Disney and EA are the ones making the decisions here. This isn't Battlefield, where DICE can do whatever they want. But let's move on to more pressing matters. If you're going to talk about spoilers, please use a spoiler tag. And speaking of spoilers, what's up with that helmet in the arena? It fell out before Boba Fett even picked it up, and it was probably just lying in the sand after the Battle of Jakku. And what's with all the social justice warrior stuff? Is it just because the new movie is coming out? And why won't DICE give us any updates on the game? It's like only five people are working on it, and they're not being transparent at all. The patch notes for the Battle of Jakku are pretty vague, too. Just general bug fixes and game additions? Come on, DICE, give us something more specific. And let's not forget about the ongoing debate between Ubisoft and EA. Sure, Ubisoft may suck at optimization, but they have better pro-consumer practices. Meanwhile, EA may have better optimization, but they suck at pro-consumer practices. It's a tough call. But let's get back to Battlefront. It's frustrating that the devs don't come to this subreddit anymore after being banned. And what's with all the talk about constructing additional cycler rifles? I don't get it. And don't even get me started on the lens flare issue. Yes, Tatooine and Jakku both have two suns, but that doesn't excuse the inconsistent look of the game. This has been a problem with DICE for years, and I have no idea why. And why do games traditionally release on Wednesdays in Europe? And why are people angry about the mods removing alpha content from the subreddit? And why does a Stormtrooper need to remove their helmet? And what's the difference between Canon and Legends? And how are we supposed to play without private servers? And why didn't the launch trailer mention Endor at night? And why are people complaining about the price of the game and the season pass? It's just 60 dollars, people, that's the price of every other AAA title. And what's with all the free DLC that's really just hairstyles and clothing? Shouldn't that stuff be in the game already? And why are people so obsessed with the Battle of Jakku? But let's end on a positive note. That slow motion effect in the trailer was gorgeous, and the music was well-chosen. And those snow particles? Beautiful. And let's not forget the Star Wars magic that makes this game so enjoyable. But there are still some issues that need to be addressed. The AT-ST can easily be destroyed by TIE-fighters and turrets, and it's difficult to get air superiority on the Rebel side. And why is this subreddit so toxic? Can't we all just share our opinions without getting attacked? Overall, I'm cautiously optimistic about Star Wars Battlefront. I just hope DICE can deliver on all their promises and give us the game we deserve. May the Force be with us all.
