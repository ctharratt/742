Okay, so I just finished reading the latest book in The Expanse series and I have to say, I am blown away. The action, the characters, the world-building, it's all just so incredible. But there's one thing that's been bugging me since I started reading the series, and that's the whole PDC vs railgun thing. Now, I know that PDCs are supposed to be used for defense against incoming missiles, while railguns are used for offense against other ships. But here's the thing, why can't PDCs be used for offense too? I mean, sure, they might not be as powerful as a railgun, but they're still pretty damn effective. And in a pinch, when you're out of railgun rounds, wouldn't it be better to have some kind of backup weapon? I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think we should limit ourselves to just one type of weapon. We should be using everything at our disposal to take down our enemies. And who knows, maybe in the future, we'll come up with even more advanced weapons that make both PDCs and railguns obsolete. But for now, we need to use what we have. And that means using PDCs for both defense and offense. We can't afford to be picky when it comes to fighting for our survival. We need to be adaptable and use every tool in our arsenal. And speaking of survival, can we talk about how badass Amos is? I mean, that scene where he's holding his weapon steady while Holden is lowering his, that's just pure awesomeness. It shows how dedicated he is to protecting his crew and how he's willing to do whatever it takes to keep them safe. But you know who else is pretty badass? David Anderson from Mass Effect. I know, I know, he's not from The Expanse, but hear me out. I was actually thinking of him when I was reading about PDCs and railguns. I guess I got my sci-fi wires crossed or something. Anyway, Anderson is just as dedicated to protecting his crew as Amos is. And he's got some serious skills when it comes to combat. I mean, the guy survived the attack on the Citadel and took down a Reaper. That's no small feat. And you know what else is cool about Anderson? He's a mentor to Shepard. He's always there to offer advice and guidance, even when things seem hopeless. He's the kind of leader that inspires loyalty and respect from his crew. I guess what I'm trying to say is that both Amos and Anderson are the kind of characters that make sci-fi so great. They're tough, they're smart, and they're willing to do whatever it takes to protect their crew. And that's what makes them so memorable. But getting back to the whole PDC vs railgun thing, I think we need to start thinking outside the box. We can't just rely on one type of weapon to get us through every situation. We need to be adaptable and use every tool at our disposal. And who knows, maybe one day we'll come up with something even better than PDCs and railguns. Maybe we'll have some kind of super weapon that can take down entire fleets with just one shot. Or maybe we'll have some kind of shield that can protect us from any kind of attack. The point is, we can't limit ourselves to just one type of weapon. We need to be open to new ideas and new technologies. We need to be willing to take risks and try new things. Because that's the only way we're going to survive in this crazy, unpredictable universe. So let's keep using PDCs and railguns for now, but let's also keep our minds open to new possibilities. Who knows what kind of amazing weapons we'll come up with in the future? All I know is that I can't wait to find out.
