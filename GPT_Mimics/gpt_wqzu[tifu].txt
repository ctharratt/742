Hey there, fellow Redditors! I'm back with some more removals from our beloved subreddit, TIFU. Now, I know some of you might be disappointed that your posts or comments have been removed, but fear not, my friends, for I am here to explain why. First up, we have ONeOfTheNerdHerd's post about spoiling a certain event in the new Star Wars movie for their brother. Now, I know we're all excited about the new movie, but let's remember to keep the spoilers to ourselves, okay? That's why we have a rule against it. So, unfortunately, ONeOfTheNerdHerd's post had to be removed. Next, we have Cpotter07's comment that violated our rule against personal attacks, trolling, and bigotry. Let's all remember to be civil and respectful towards each other, even if we disagree. That's why we have this rule in place. Moving on, we have nwalters33's post about witnessing a dog being hit by a car. Now, I know this is a traumatic experience, but unfortunately, it doesn't qualify as a fuck-up unless it was your fault. So, sorry nwalters33, but your post had to be removed.
