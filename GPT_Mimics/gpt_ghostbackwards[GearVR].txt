Hey there, fellow VR enthusiasts! I just got my hands on the Gear VR and I am absolutely blown away by the experience. I have been playing around with it for a few days now and I have to say, it is one of the coolest things I have ever experienced. I have been having a blast exploring different apps and games, and I wanted to share my thoughts and experiences with all of you. First off, let's talk about the ski jump. What was up with that? I mean, I know it's just a game, but it felt so real! I was actually scared to jump off the ramp, even though I knew I was just sitting in my living room. It was such a rush, and I can't wait to try it again. Speaking of games, I have been playing Mario 3 on the Gear VR and it is so much fun. I use a Note 5 with my Gear VR and it works great. The graphics are amazing and it feels like I am actually in the game. I highly recommend giving it a try if you haven't already. Now, let's talk about the people I have met so far in the VR world. I have to say, everyone has been so cool and funny. It's amazing how VR can bring people together from all over the world. I have had some great conversations with people from all walks of life, and it's been a really positive experience. One thing I have heard people talking about is shovelware. I wasn't sure what that meant at first, but I did some research and found out that it refers to low-quality apps and games that are rushed to market without much thought or effort put into them. It's a shame that some developers are more interested in making a quick buck than creating quality content for VR. Speaking of apps, I have been trying to figure out how to use vTime. I have searched for it in MilkVR, but it's not showing up. Does anyone know how to access it? I would love to give it a try. I have also been thinking about adding some weight to my Gear VR. It feels a bit too light for my liking, and I think adding some rocks or something similar would make it feel more substantial. Has anyone else tried this? If so, how did it work out? I highly recommend getting a Bluetooth controller if you don't already have one. I picked up a Moga controller and it has been a game-changer. It makes playing games so much easier and more enjoyable. I have been using it with Mario 3 and it works great. Speaking of games, I am always on the lookout for new VR apps to try. Does anyone have any recommendations? I have been playing a lot of games lately, but I am always looking for something new and exciting. One thing that has been bothering me is the fact that I can't lean forward or back in the Gear VR. I read about how the Oculus is wired and it seems like it should be possible, but I can't figure out how to do it. Does anyone have any tips or tricks? I have been thinking about getting the Oculus Touch, but I have a gift card balance on Amazon and I don't want to spend any money at the moment. The Touch is $50, but I found it on Target.com for a similar price. I am hoping it works just as well as the Oculus version. I brought my Gear VR into work today and people loved it. It was so cool to see their reactions and to share the experience with them. Last night, I showed it to my girlfriend and her roommate, who had been making fun of me for being so excited about it. They ended up spending all night swimming with sharks and screaming when they got too close. It was hilarious. I feel like I got really lucky with my Gear VR setup. I essentially paid $150 for the 64GB Note 5 and the Gear VR combined. I got the Note 5 for $150 and the 32GB version would have been $50. It's amazing how things work out sometimes. I have been thinking about getting the Moga Hero Power, but I am not sure if it will work with my setup. Has anyone tried it? If so, how did it work out? I have been having some issues with stuttering on my Gear VR. It's making it almost unusable, which is really frustrating. I downloaded Sideloader, but I am not sure what to do next. Would this help with the stuttering? I don't have power saving mode on, but I am curious why that would make a difference. I am also on the lookout for the best Bluetooth controller. I want something that is comfortable to hold and easy to use. How much did you pay for your controller? Are you in the States? Where did you get it from? I have been reading through some of the comments on different VR forums and it's amazing how passionate people are about this technology. It's really inspiring to see so many people coming together to share their experiences and ideas. I am still trying to figure out how to reload the Oculus software. I am not sure if I need to delete it and start from scratch, or if there is an easier way to do it. Does anyone have any tips or tricks? I have also been wondering about 360 protection and CM Locker. What are they and how do they work? Can anyone walk me through this? Overall, I am absolutely loving my Gear VR experience. It's been so much fun exploring different apps and games, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for VR. If you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend giving it a shot. You won't be disappointed!
