As a 47-year-old suburban American, I can relate to the struggles of feeling like an outsider in a small, conservative town. I've never been one to conform to societal norms, and I've often found myself at odds with my neighbors and community members because of it. But I've learned that staying true to myself and my beliefs is more important than fitting in with the crowd. First and foremost, it's important to remember that people will judge you based on your appearance and behavior. It's unfortunate, but it's a fact of life. However, that doesn't mean you should change who you are to please others. If you enjoy wearing metal band shirts and sporting a pentagram, then do it proudly. Your neighbors and the cops should know better than to assume that your aesthetic choices reflect your character or intentions. That being said, it's also important to recognize that your behavior may be perceived as confrontational or provocative. Walking around with a six-foot boa constrictor may be seen as a "f*ck you" to the conservative town in which you live. While you have every right to own and care for exotic pets, it's important to consider how your actions may be interpreted by others. If you're deliberately trying to provoke a reaction, then you can't be surprised when people don't like you. It's a delicate balance between staying true to yourself and being respectful of others. You don't have to compromise your beliefs or interests, but you should also be mindful of how your actions may affect those around you. It's possible to be true to yourself without intentionally provoking others. As for your roommate, it's not your responsibility to wake him up for class or take care of him. He's an adult and should be able to manage his own schedule. If he misses class, that's on him. You don't have to be his caretaker or parent. However, it's important to maintain a civil relationship with him. You don't have to be best friends, but you should be able to coexist peacefully in the same living space. Now, onto the topic of your feelings for your friend. It's a difficult situation to be in, and there's no easy answer. However, I would caution against joking around about your interest in women if it's not true. It's not fair to your friend or to yourself to continue down that path if it's not genuine. It's better to be honest and upfront about your feelings, even if it's scary or awkward. Of course, there's always the risk of rejection or damaging the friendship. But if you don't take the chance, you'll never know what could have been. It's important to be true to yourself and your feelings, even if it's not the easiest path to take. In the end, it's important to remember that your life is always fixable. No matter how difficult or overwhelming a situation may seem, there's always a way out. Reach out to friends or family for support, take care of yourself both physically and emotionally, and don't be afraid to make changes if necessary. It's not always easy to be different in a small town, but it's important to stay true to yourself and your beliefs. Don't compromise who you are just to fit in with the crowd. You'll find your community eventually, and in the meantime, stay strong and stay true to yourself.
