Oh man, where do I even start? Editing my DNA? Hell yeah, sign me up! I mean, who wouldn't want a stronger heart and lungs, lower fat storage, higher muscle density, healthier bones and teeth, and a faster brain? And don't even get me started on removing the propensity for certain cancers that run in my family. That's a no-brainer. Oh, and let's not forget about making my ass less hairy. Thank god for science, am I right? But let's be real here, UBI isn't coming any time soon. I mean, sure, I want it to come and I think it would be one of the greatest things we could ever accomplish, but let's be realistic. We're facing some serious political issues in most countries right now. So, my advice? Go to college or learn a trade or something because between now and then, you're gonna be screwed. And don't even get me started on this whole efficiency thing. Just because a device uses less power than it did a couple years ago doesn't mean we're gonna use less power overall. We humans have a terrible habit of using exponentially more when efficiency goes up. So, yeah, any given device might use less power, but we end up using it so much more now that the total amount of power we use goes up. It's a vicious cycle, man. And what's with these claims of eternal life? I mean, sure, they gave this guy a slightly improved immune system and some extra energy to work, but that's hardly eternal life. It's more like a multi-tool that does the job of coffee and a yearly flu vaccine. I mean, come on, people. Let's not get ahead of ourselves here. But let's talk about something more fun, like gryphons. Can you imagine mixing a raven and a Norwegian forest cat to create a badass lap-gryphon? Or how about mixing a barn owl and a tabby cat to make a cute little mouser gryphon? I mean, the possibilities are endless. And speaking of fun, I can't wait for self-driving cars to take off. I'm scared shitless of driving, so this technology can't come soon enough. I'm even planning on going to college for nanotech so I can be a part of it all. And don't even get me started on Kurzweil and his zany predictions. I don't know if he's right or wrong, but I love how opposed his ideas are to what everyone thinks they know. But let's get serious for a minute. I don't understand why people are so against parents choosing certain characteristics for their child. As long as those choices have no serious side effects, what's the problem? And let's not forget about robots taking over jobs. I mean, we should want that, right? It'll free up time for us to pursue our passions and interests. And under a UBI, those who have the talent and potential and desire to become artists or scientists will have the ability to do so. It's a win-win situation. But let's not forget about the big question: where are all the aliens? I mean, sure, we might not be able to see them, but we should be able to see the results of their existence, right? Well, not necessarily. Just because there should be evidence of alien life doesn't mean there will be. There could be billions of other intelligent species in our own galaxy or there could just be us. And just because there is other life out there doesn't mean they want to contact us. Intelligent behavior can't be easily predicted or boiled down to a simple formula. And let's not forget about the difficulty in detecting planets, let alone evidence of life. So, structures and spaceships are out of the question. And don't even get me started on Dyson spheres. Why haven't we found any? Who knows? In conclusion, there's a lot to think about here. DNA editing, UBI, efficiency, gryphons, self-driving cars, Kurzweil, robots taking over jobs, and the search for alien life. It's a lot to take in, but it's all worth considering. And who knows what the future holds? All we can do is wait and see.
