Hey there, fellow heisters! It's great to be back and chatting about our favorite game, Payday 2. I was just looking back at some of my old Techforcer threads and I have to say, I'm pretty proud of the work I did there. But you know what they say, there's always room for improvement. That's why I've been working on a new skill tree, just for fun really. It's not meant for official use or anything, but if you guys want to see it, I could post it when it's a little more complete. I've already shown it to a few people and they seem to think it's pretty balanced, but could use a tweak here or there. So, I'm open to suggestions. Speaking of suggestions, have you guys ever thought about sawing a shield in half? I mean, how cool would that be? I know it's not the most practical thing to do in the game, but it would definitely be satisfying. Now, let's talk about the Mastermind skill tree. I know some people think it's not as powerful as some of the other trees, but I disagree. As a Mastermind, your job is to stay back and be the guy who survives and makes sure your team-mates never get into custody. It's all about concealment, so most of the pistols or maybe an SMG would be your best bet. Or, if you're feeling bold, you could go for the Judge. Just make sure you don't use any special ammo. And speaking of bold moves, have you guys ever tried a sniper build? I know it's not the most practical thing to do, but it can be a lot of fun. Just make sure you don't try to use it for stealth, because the sniper can't be silenced. It would only be a pseudo stealth build, at best. Now, let's talk about accuracy and stability. I used to think that all percentage bonuses to these stats were true, but I've since learned that they're not. I can't really explain it, but there are some guides out there that can. I learned about it after posting my Stormtrooper Build, which was a lot of fun, but not the most practical. If you really want to make sure you never run out of ammo, though, you should definitely ace the ammo bag skill. It's a game-changer, trust me. And while we're on the subject of skills, I have to say that Inspire is one of the most important ones out there. It can really make a difference in a tough situation. Now, I know some of you might be thinking that my builds are a little gimmicky or strange, but that's kind of the point. I like to make builds that are thematic or concept-based, rather than just trying to make the most practical build possible. Of course, I'll still try to make them DW viable, but don't get your hopes up too high. And speaking of DW, have you guys ever tried using two sentries on Bank Heist? Yeah, not the best idea. But on Watchdogs day 1, they can be pretty handy. It's all about knowing when to use the right tools for the job. Anyway, I'm rambling a bit here, so I'll wrap things up. Thanks for taking the time to read my thoughts on Payday 2. I'm always open to suggestions and feedback, so feel free to let me know what you think. And remember, hard boiled is bad.
