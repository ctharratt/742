Yep, signalling. It's a lost art, really. Morse Code communication is a thing of the past, but it's still useful to know. You never know when you might need to communicate with someone without speaking. And if you assume that the driver following you is a Blind A*hole, then you can use signalling in conjunction with the horn to get Maximum Effective Communication (MEC). It's all about being prepared for any situation. But when is this ending? That's the real question. It all depends on your frame of reference. There was a research done on similar lines, exploring the speed of the sounds of S and C. It's fascinating stuff, really. But it was a mistake on the part of the quoter. He was referring to Light Sabers, but wrongly assumed they were pens. It just goes to show that you can't always trust what people say. Or, I could use a magnet to unsuspend them, then drink? Don't listen to him. He's trying to con you. It's actually a paradox. If you had bit 8 coins in the past, then you have 8 bit coins. But if you want 1 byte, you'll have to do it in the present. The issue is, as soon as you byte a coin, it has happened in the past and it changes to a 'bit' coin anyway. It's a mind-bending concept, but it's important to understand these things. But let's move on to something more practical. Take a real science idea and develop it in the realm of shitty science. Skew whatever natural laws we have and end up with something glorious. It could be a [Discussion] post. For example, what if the DNA of a human and a gorilla were combined, but only a few characteristics were carried over? We could have flairs so that they are (fringe) scientifically tagged for easy access. Like writing prompts, there could be idea prompts for someone to post a shitty idea and ask for how it can be done/built/made, etc. Then we get the fringe scientists to take over and agree on how it should be done. It's like research, but rather than research, it's on a tangible object. For example, an invention/idea request: [IR] A device to transport a single human, using only air as fuel. The answer could even be a shitty vehicle drawn by someone, explaining it in detail in the premise of shitty science. And more tags too, if possible. The possibilities are endless. But apparently, one should be qualified even to nominate. It's a shame, really. I only have a Bachelor's in Approximation of Everything. It requires a PhD to really make a difference in this world. But we can still dream, can't we? You are compressing the compressed. It's a common mistake, really. But thanks for the citation. Can I add this to Wikipedia? It's important to share knowledge with the world. It escalates towards the floor. It's a misconception, really. It's not "Toucan play at the game," it's "Toucan! play the game." It was said by the famous pirate Jack Sparrow when he didn't want to indulge in a petty game of Chinese checkers, so he asked his pet toucan to play the game. Toucans are naturally very good at Chinese checkers. [citation needed] But let's get back to the real world. The probability of a deer accidentally jumping into the path of a moving car is greater than the probability of a deer accidentally jumping into the path of a moving bullet. But that doesn't mean we can't increase the probability of a deer hitting the bullet. We just need to increase the number of bullets per minute. Sadly, we can't do that with a car. They had a heated exchange. It happens to the best of us. But did you plug in the ethernet cable in the back? And did you use soap water to reduce the pH levels to a safer zone? It's important to take care of your equipment. No wonder that shit glowed in the dark. That's why we used to make it in the morning when the light is plentiful. It was a semi-automatic refrigerator that only works in the morning. In the night, you have to pedal a given pedal for it to work. It's all about being resourceful. And speaking of resourceful, one way to save is to never complete one 'look.' Try to have them on your eyes as long as possible. I've managed to look through my binoculars nine times in the last year, only occasionally taking them off during a particular ritual. This way, I plan to use them forever. Since the limits haven't been thoroughly tested in real life, who knows what's possible?
