Bad behavior which is not punished will be repeated. This is a fact that we all need to accept. If we let someone get away with something, they will most likely do it again. This is especially true in relationships. If your partner lies to you and you let it slide, they will think it's okay to lie to you again in the future. This is why it's important to set boundaries and enforce consequences when those boundaries are crossed. Now, let's talk about a specific situation. You have a girlfriend who lied to you about her feelings for another guy. She said she needed "closure" but in reality, she was just sniffing around to see if she could revive something with him. She is his Alpha Widow, and you are just her average, acceptable boyfriend. She knows that you need her more than she needs you, so she took a chance that you wouldn't find out about her lies. And now that you have found out, what are you going to do about it? First of all, you need to realize that you only have control over yourself. You can't control your girlfriend's actions or feelings. But you can control how you react to them. You need to become SO AWESOME that she'd never even DREAM of taking a chance of losing you. This means being confident, independent, and not putting up with bad behavior. Or, you can write her off as a bad investment of your time and money. It's up to you to decide what's best for you. One thing you need to do is stop being her best girlfriend. You need to go back and find your testicles, and LEAD this woman in a relationship. You can't let her walk all over you and get away with bad behavior. You need to set boundaries and enforce consequences when those boundaries are crossed. This is the only way to have a healthy and happy relationship. Now, let's talk about sex. In relationships, sex is where the rubber meets the road. If you are satisfied in that department, then just thank your lucky stars that she doesn't have a shopping addiction. But if you're not satisfied, then you need to address that issue. Talk to your girlfriend about what you want and need in the bedroom. If she's not willing to meet your needs, then you need to decide if this relationship is worth continuing. Moving on, let's talk about a different situation. You have a friend who is considering dating someone who lives with their ex. This is a common scenario, and it's important to approach it with caution. You must not read r/relationships very much. This EXACT scenario ("my new gf lives with her ex!!") fits right in here. You need to ask yourself if you're comfortable with the situation. If you're not, then you need to talk to your friend about your concerns. But ultimately, it's up to your friend to decide what's best for them. Now, let's talk about adoption. Jean had no rights in adoption. She got the closed adoption she wanted. She didn't try hard enough to hide her identity. Yeah, decisions have consequences. But her descendants have a human right to know as much as possible about their family medical history. In a world where we force parents to stand aside while the court decides what medical treatments their children will receive, we can tolerate pulling the jeans off of Jean, for the sake of her descendants' health. Moving on, let's talk about relationships again. Emotional cheating is a real thing. It's when someone forms an emotional connection with someone else outside of their relationship. This can be just as damaging as physical cheating. If you suspect that your partner is emotionally cheating on you, you need to address it. Talk to your partner about your concerns and set boundaries if necessary. Now, let's talk about stereotypes. Stereotypes are harmful and should not be perpetuated. If someone is dating you because of a stereotype, that's not a good thing. You should be valued for who you are, not for what someone thinks you should be. And if someone repeatedly patronizes you because of a stereotype, that's not okay either. You should stand up for yourself and not let anyone treat you poorly. In conclusion, relationships are complicated and require effort and communication. It's important to set boundaries and enforce consequences when those boundaries are crossed. It's also important to address issues like sex and emotional cheating. And we should all strive to not perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Remember, bad behavior which is not punished will be repeated. So, don't let anyone get away with bad behavior in your relationships.
