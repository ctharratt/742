Hey there, I've been having some major issues with CCOR/WIC/Frostfall 3 and I was wondering if anyone could help me out. I know that these mods are supposed to be compatible, but for some reason, when CCOR is installed, Frostfall doesn't recognize any heat or warmth from WIC. It just says "Warmth:--". However, when I disable CCOR, Frostfall works perfectly fine with WIC. Does anyone have any clues as to why this is happening? I've made a thread about this issue and detailed everything I've done in attempts to correct it, but I haven't had any luck so far. Any help or advice from anyone would be massively appreciated. I'm considering reverting to a previous version of Frostfall since I haven't seen anything that's keeping me with 3.0 anyway. To be honest, Frostfall 3 feels unfinished to me. There is a tab for the armor and clothing settings that isn't ready until 3.1, and there have been a few settings removed. I genuinely don't know the difference between this and 2.x except for the slight tweak to the warmth/coverage system. If I actually needed CCOR this playthrough (role-playing an Argonian merchant), I would revert Frostfall. I've tried removing CCOR, but it didn't work. I also tried removing and reinstalling all of the cloak mods, but that didn't work either. I'm very tempted to revert to a previous version of Frostfall since I haven't seen anything that's keeping me with 3.0 anyway. On a different note, do COT and RLO work nicely together? I've seen countless pages of problems for the two. Have you used LOOT? Because Live another life should be at the very bottom. Try using that. I thought it was just mine! XD Fair enough, just wanted to suggest it if you didn't already use it. Try looking at fnis, like I said. I know that Locational damage has a "Headshots kill" and then an "Unless wearing a heavy helmet". Basically meaning that an arrow to the head will instantly kill anyone, regardless of level, unless they are wearing a heavy helmet, then it will do next to nothing. You can also tune it to have custom critical hit rates on certain parts of the body (anything from the head/neck to the knee and feet) with melee, archery, and magic. You can also make it so that firing an arrow into someone's throat from 5m away is an instant kill. Basically, whatever suits your level of realism. The only annoying thing is that this only seems to work on humans, so with requiem, you can easily slaughter a party of bandits if you know how to use a bow, but a mudcrab can still rip you apart. I'm not too experienced with modding, but at a first look, I want to suggest that you move the "11.Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch.esp" to just after "5.Dragonborn.esm". "Violens" should also be near the bottom of the load order, I believe. Try moving "FNIS" to the very bottom. Maybe it could be something to do with a custom animation? Have you used LOOT for this load order? Try it out and report back. I know it's a direct link to the application, but there's nothing dodgy about it. I just thought it would be a bit more convenient. Please check the link at the bottom of the browser when you hover over it, and feel free to google it yourself. Okay, that cleared things up. Thank you, dude. So I have 6gb of ram, and by that explanation, I assume that Skyrim only uses 3.1. Would using ENB boost allow it to use 6gb? Thus improving the performance? I'll be looking forward to seeing it! :D That is a fantastic list of mods. Thank you so much! Feel free to update it with more if you find any! I can't tell if this is intentionally retarded or a genuine post... I've been trying to use ineed, but I just can't seem to enjoy it as much as RND. But I just thought it could be an interesting little option, though it may not be worth the effort and amount of scripts (I know nothing of scripts. It could use a lot or very few). I once found a mod, though I can't remember the name, that was a needs mod that took it to the next level. You have stuff like Protein, carbs, nutrition levels, etc. I highly doubt that it is easy to implement, but if you liked the idea and could figure it out, it could be an optional difficulty (Like Frostfall's old hardcore/normal settings). Just a thought. I gotta say that I love nothing more than playing as a hunter/alchemist, with the relevant mods to accompany them. Hunterborn, Frostfall, Alchemy overhaul, Cooking overhaul, etc. It's awesome to just live off the land. I've never done so, but that could be exactly what I need. Fucking bandits get me every time. Ah! I used to have an ENB, but for some reason, this time (several PC wipes later) I'm averaging around 30fps. Is COT resource-heavy? Honestly, I think I'll jump ship and get pure weather! Thank you! I have that installed. I use it for the weather effects to go with Frostfall. Are there better alternatives around? I can't even get boot camp to run. I've tried, and it just leaves me with some searching screen. It's frustrating. Ah :/ thanks for the quick reply, I was just wondering if I'd be able to play with my girlfriend on her Mac. Would this work on Mac? I thought I'd double-pressed enter after each one. My bad. What does ftfy mean? Foxes > Kitsune Bear > Arctodus (Not too different) Wolves > maybe reduce the number and add jackals or hyenas? Off the top of my head. Can't vouch for quality. Actually, I wouldn't waste your time any more. I got it to work, and I can't even kill a wolf. I mean... Electricity from hand AND staff doesn't kill a wolf before it can kill me. Just no. I am not going to spend the rest of the game in fear of a fight with a wolf. How the shit am I supposed to survive after being spotted by an angry bear? or a sabre wolf? Are human enemies this hard? Yeah, I've reinstalled and still no avail. It STILL thinks that LAL should be near the top. Sorted the list out by hand. You are an absolute star. I managed to get past the Bethesda logo last night. It was the same issue that you had mentioned. So, I've installed everything that you have suggested, removed SKYtest (I want to just be able to play the game now, I'm tired of fighting with mods and incompatibilities). And here is my load order right now. Note: I did the load order. I reinstalled LOOT, and it seemed to still not work, so I just followed your list and put everything as I saw fit. In conclusion, I'm still having issues with CCOR/WIC/Frostfall 3, but I'm hoping that someone can help me out. I'm also considering reverting to a previous version of Frostfall since I haven't seen anything that's keeping me with 3.0 anyway. Thank you to everyone who has offered their advice and help so far.
