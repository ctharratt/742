As a tech enthusiast, I am always on the lookout for the latest and greatest gadgets. And when it comes to portable devices, the Microsoft Surface Pro 2 is definitely one of the most impressive ones out there. For me, the main reason I got the Pro 2 was for gaming. I had previously owned the Pro 1, but the upgrade was definitely worth it. With the Pro 2, I now have portable Photoshop and essentially a portable Cintiq, which is worth way more than the $1300 I paid for it. But the real game-changer for me was the fact that I could now access my entire Steam catalog of around 500 games on the Pro 2. It's a gamer's dream come true. I can now play all my favorite games on the go, without having to lug around a bulky gaming laptop. And the best part? It runs flawlessly on the Pro 2. I was even able to play Mario Kart Wii on it and have it be actually playable. It's amazing how far technology has come. Of course, gaming isn't the only thing the Pro 2 is good for. The Wacom stylus on the Pro is incredible, too. It's perfect for artists and designers who need a portable device that can handle their creative needs. And with the Pro 2's powerful specs, it can handle even the most demanding programs with ease. One thing I love about the Pro 2 is its versatility. It can be used as a tablet, a laptop, or even a desktop with the right accessories. I use a GameCube to USB adapter on it and it works perfectly, with zero lag. And with the wireless dongle I have, I can even use up to 4 Wii U Pro controllers on it. The possibilities are endless. But as much as I love the Pro 2, there are still some limitations. For one, the accuracy of the stylus in the corners of the screen isn't amazing. It's a minor issue, but it can be frustrating at times. And while the Pro 2 can handle most games with ease, there are still some that require more powerful hardware. But overall, I'm extremely happy with my purchase. Of course, the Pro 2 isn't the only device I own. I also have a Nexus 7 and an iPad, both of which I love for different reasons. But if I had to choose just one device to use for everything, it would definitely be the Pro 2. It's the perfect combination of power, portability, and versatility. One thing that does concern me, however, is the lack of software available in the Microsoft Store. While I love my Surface Pro, I wouldn't use it nearly as much if I were restricted to only apps in the Microsoft Store. There's far more software available on Android and iOS, which is a bit of a drawback. But hopefully, as more developers start creating apps for Windows 8, this will become less of an issue. Overall, I think the Surface Pro 2 is an amazing device that's perfect for anyone who needs a powerful, portable device that can handle anything they throw at it. Whether you're a gamer, an artist, or just someone who needs a device that can do it all, the Pro 2 is definitely worth considering. As for the future of the Surface Pro line, I'm excited to see what Microsoft has in store. Rumors are circulating about a new Surface Pro with a Haswell chip, which would greatly benefit the device in terms of battery life and performance. And while I'm not sure if it's true, I'm definitely keeping my fingers crossed. In the end, it's clear that the Surface Pro 2 is a device that's here to stay. It's versatile, powerful, and perfect for anyone who needs a device that can handle anything they throw at it. And with the right accessories, it can even replace your desktop or gaming laptop. So if you're in the market for a new portable device, the Surface Pro 2 is definitely worth considering.
