Sweet. Adding to my queue thanks. Perfect, this is what I'm looking for. Thanks. I don't often see people talking about Atmosphere. I absolutely love this song, and truth be told, my favorite label is Rhymesayers. Atmosphere is a cut above the rest, and I don't know why people aren't talking about them more often. They deserve so much more credit than they currently get. Last year, I saw Atmosphere, Brother Ali, and Dilated Peoples at a show in Berkeley, California. It was an amazing experience. A coworker of mine went to Minneapolis in December to go see their 20-year anniversary show. He said it was awesome, and I really regret not going with him since I had the money to fly there. Thanks for adding this one. I can get down with anything, to be honest. I just love good music. I'll give all versions of this song a try. I found three versions of this song by Above and Beyond. I'll give all three a listen. Thanks, 100% serious. OK, no problem. I'll check anything out people have to offer. I ain't no hater lol thanks for suggesting it. I'll add it to my queue and listen to it soon. I am just barely getting into Lorde, but this song is definitely a good track. Thanks. What do you mean? Spotify is legal.

I literally have never heard anybody say they didn't like Spotify. For me, saying "I don't like Spotify" is like saying "I don't like putting clothes on when I leave the house." Lol, it's a must in my opinion, but what's your reasoning behind thinking it's horrible? Your song has been added. Your song has been added. Your song has been added. Damn, I'm sorry, man.
