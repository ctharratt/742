Daily. Masturbation is a natural and healthy part of life, and it's perfectly okay to do it while in a relationship. In fact, it can even improve your relationship! But let's not forget that everyone's genitals are different, so I'll just link you to some informative videos that can help you out. And let me tell you, there's no need for Viagra. If you want to last longer, just focus on your breathing and try not to touch your dick too much. Take breaks and focus on your partner's pleasure too. Remember, it's a threesome, not just two people worshipping your cock. You and your partner can even tag team the third person's vulva. Spend more time exploring different positions and don't get stuck in a rut. This will not only improve everyone's experience, but it can also help delay your orgasm, which can be unpredictable at times. Now, I know what it's like to feel like you can't imagine your life without someone, even though the relationship is over. But trust me, it's important to move on. One helpful tip is to imagine and fantasize about things that would be impossible with that person. Imagine someone picking you up if that person can't, or participating in an activity that the person would never do. This can help you imagine and fantasize away from that person. And if you're watching porn, try watching actors who look nothing like your ex. It's not that hard, and I highly recommend some really good tumblrs. Now, let's talk about condoms. If you're not sure what size to get, try using a measuring tape to get an accurate measurement. And don't forget, there are other options like condoms that go inside orifices. And if you're a first-timer, check out Dr. Doe's First Time Tips and some anatomy videos to keep you curious. And let's not forget about good sex. It involves being both alpha and beta, gamma and delta. So stay creative and curious, and remember to communicate before sex. It makes sex better every time. And if you're experiencing screaming during sex, it's more of a feeling than an actual act of high-pitched phonation. And if you're worried about your hymen breaking, don't be. It's just your period, and you never really "lost" your virginity. You just had sex for the first time. Congratulations! But if your partner is not respecting your boundaries and not stopping when you say "stop," that's assault. You need to tear into them about this and consider ending the relationship. It's a breach of trust and you owe it to yourself to stand up for yourself. And let's clear up a common misconception. There's no such thing as a "g-spot" orgasm. Orgasms are orgasms, and what's been happening is that your partner has been training themselves to focus on their pleasure center. Instead, learn about the majesty of the clitoris and why it's the organ of pleasure. And when you masturbate, try changing up your touch types and locations. Masturbate with condoms on and try touching other parts of your body. And if you're on anti-depressants and having trouble reaching orgasm, keep trying and masturbating better. You'll get through it. And if you're hesitant about getting tested, just go get tested. It's important to know your status and protect yourself and your partner. And if you're experiencing sexual arousal from minimal contact, consider yourself lucky and maybe even write more about it. And if you're worried about sweating during sex, try having sex in the shower or in a slightly colder room. Vary your sex positions and spend time just using your tongue to cool down. And if you're worried about getting strep from your partner, wear underwear while you do it. But if your relationship is not working for you and you're violating your partner's boundaries, it's time to end it. You both deserve to be in healthy and respectful relationships. And if you're having trouble improving your orgasm, try masturbating more and focusing on your partner's pleasure too. And let's not forget, there's no such thing as "normal." Everyone's experiences are different, and that's okay. And if you're experiencing trouble with your anus during orgasm, try pulling out the butt plug as you approach orgasm. And finally, let's not forget about the importance of consent and respect in all sexual encounters. It's not just about straight relationships, it's about all relationships. Let's strive to be decent human beings and treat each other with respect and kindness. And always remember, masturbation is a natural and healthy part of life.
