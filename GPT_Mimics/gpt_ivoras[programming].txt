Cache Invalidation and Mainframes: A Modern Perspective Cache invalidation is a common problem in modern computing, and it is what prompted me to experiment with adding metadata tags to cached records. The idea is simple: by adding metadata tags to cached records, we can easily invalidate them when necessary, without having to clear the entire cache. This approach has proven to be very effective in improving cache performance and reducing cache invalidation issues. However, cache invalidation is not the only problem that modern computing faces. One of the most significant challenges is the performance gap between mainframes and modern computing platforms. Mainframes have long been known for their superior performance and reliability, but in recent years, the gap between mainframes and modern computing platforms has narrowed significantly. For example, consider the issue of random number generation. There is a significant difference between cryptographically secure random number generators and approximate random number generators. Each type is terrible for some specific problems. However, modern computing platforms have made significant strides in improving the quality of random number generation, making them more suitable for a wider range of applications. Another issue is the use of K&R C function declaration style. While this style was once popular, it is now considered outdated and has been replaced by more modern coding practices. This is just one example of how modern computing has evolved and improved over time. Another issue is the use of mainframes for high-performance computing. While mainframes were once the go-to platform for high-performance computing, modern computing platforms have made significant strides in this area. For example, quad-core cell phones running at 1.5 GHz can easily top the performance of mainframes from just a few years ago. Of course, not all transactions are equal, and some applications may still require the use of mainframes. For example, if the mainframe runs a simple ISAM database without the SQL overhead, it may still have a significant advantage over modern computing platforms. However, even with all the SQL overhead, single Intel machines nowadays run pretty well with over 1000 concurrent connections. The world has moved on, and what was once an inferior platform (the PC) has grown up. Today, modern computing platforms are more powerful and reliable than ever before, and they offer a wide range of features and capabilities that were once only available on mainframes. One example of this is the use of directly indexed arrays for counting integer product IDs. While this approach was once considered inefficient, it is now the fastest and most efficient way to do it. Today's modern computing platforms have more than enough memory to handle the task, and using a flat, directly indexed array is the best tool for the job. Another example is the use of specialized coprocessors, such as network cards that implement parts of TCP/IP and RAID cards that perform RAID calculations at nearly "line speeds." These coprocessors are now available on modern computing platforms and offer significant performance advantages over traditional mainframes. However, it is important to note that not all applications are suitable for modern computing platforms. For example, if a job is optimized for VSAM, it would be a waste of resources to translate it to an SQL database. In these cases, mainframes may still offer significant advantages over modern computing platforms. In conclusion, while mainframes were once the go-to platform for high-performance computing, modern computing platforms have made significant strides in this area. Today's modern computing platforms are more powerful and reliable than ever before, and they offer a wide range of features and capabilities that were once only available on mainframes. While there may still be some applications that require the use of mainframes, it is clear that modern computing platforms have narrowed the performance gap significantly. As such, it is important for businesses to consider the advantages and disadvantages of both mainframes and modern computing platforms when choosing a platform for their applications. Ultimately, the choice between mainframes and modern computing platforms will depend on the specific needs of the business and the applications they are running. However, it is clear that modern computing platforms have come a long way in recent years and offer significant advantages over traditional mainframes.
