I recently went to Disneyland and let me tell you, it was a wild ride. I saw all sorts of people working there, from white to black and everything in between. It was great to see such diversity in the workforce. But let's talk about something more important, like Emily Blunt. That woman is a goddess. Not only is she incredibly sexy, but she's also versatile and talented. I mean, she could play Rocky Balboa and I'd still think she was best suited for the role. And don't even get me started on her acting skills. She's a force to be reckoned with. Now, let's talk about some movies. Jurassic World? Rubbish. The only good things about it were Chris Pratt and watching Bryce Dallas Howard run around in a tank top. If we're going Australian, let's talk about Hugh Jackman or Eric Bana. Those guys are the real deal. But let's not forget about Lake Bell. She's highly underrated as an actress and she's damn nice to look at. And Joel Edgerton? He's a brilliant Australian actor turned writer and director. The man is a genius. Speaking of geniuses, let's talk about Manson. I wish he had gotten that pedo instead of Sharon Tate. But let's not dwell on the negative. Let's talk about DC and how they should dominate the comic book movie world. I mean, come on, they have some of the best characters out there. And speaking of characters, let's talk about Han Solo. Harrison Ford is almost 80, people. Nobody else can be Han Solo. He's the one and only. But let's switch gears and talk about some recent movies. I saw a movie in LA last week and it was really, really good. Did they modernize the language or is it in the original language? Either way, it was a great film. And let's not forget about John Wick. That movie was awesome. Hitman, on the other hand, was embarrassing. But let's not dwell on the bad. Let's talk about Fifty Shades of Grey. Or should I say Fifty Shades of Red? Early reports aren't good, but who knows? It could surprise us all. Now, let's talk about some controversial opinions. There Will Be Blood? Boring. Long, drawn-out story with little to no excitement. And don't even get me started on The Shining. I hated that movie. It barely touched on any of the reasons he went crazy. And let's not forget about Terminator Genysis and Marvel movies. They're full of CGI and they just don't look like movies anymore. Give me real cars crashing and flipping any day. But let's not end on a negative note. Let's talk about some great actors. Liam Neeson? Awesome. Eva Green? I could listen to her for days. And Anthony Hopkins? He nailed the New Zealand accent in World's Fastest Indian. The man is a legend. In conclusion, Disneyland was a blast, Emily Blunt is a goddess, and let's dominate the comic book movie world. And let's not forget about the real cars crashing and flipping. That's what makes a great movie.
