Oh boy, do I have a cleaning tip for you! I learned this from the one and only Shannon Lush, who knows all things cleaning. So, get this, you take a couple of ice cubes and put them in a plastic bag. Then, you put the bag over the stain until the wax is really hard. And let me tell you, it gets hard! Once it's hard, you use a flat wood stick or a take away plastic knife to remove all of the hard wax. It comes off so easily, you won't believe it. But wait, there's more! After you remove the wax, you put paper towel over the stain and aim a hair dryer at it. You push the paper towel down while you're doing it and keep changing over your paper towel until it's all absorbed. It's like magic, I tell you. You'll be left with a greasy mark, but don't worry, we've got a solution for that too. You can rub tea tree oil on the greasy mark and it comes straight out. I mean, can you believe it? Shannon Lush really knows all things cleaning. I've tried this method myself and it works like a charm. I had a candle wax stain on my carpet and I thought it was ruined forever. But with this method, it came out completely. I was amazed. I mean, who knew that ice cubes and tea tree oil could be such powerful cleaning tools? I sure didn't. But now that I know, I'm going to be using this method for all my wax-related cleaning needs. And let me tell you, I have a lot of those. I love candles, but I'm always spilling wax everywhere. It's a real problem. But with this method, I don't have to worry about it anymore. I can just enjoy my candles without fear of ruining my carpets or clothes. It's a game-changer, I tell you. And it's all thanks to Shannon Lush and her amazing cleaning tips. I mean, have you ever heard of anyone else using ice cubes to remove wax? I sure haven't.
