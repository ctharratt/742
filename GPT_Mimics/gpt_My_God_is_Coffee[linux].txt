Why Politics Shouldn't Be on /r/Linux As a regular user of /r/linux, I have noticed an increasing amount of political news being posted on the subreddit. While I understand that politics and technology are often intertwined, I don't think that /r/linux is the right place for political discussions. Firstly, political discussions often lead to heated arguments and can create a toxic environment on the subreddit. This can discourage users from participating in discussions and can even drive them away from the subreddit altogether. Secondly, political discussions can distract from the main focus of the subreddit, which is Linux and open source software. While it's important to be aware of political issues that affect the Linux community, it's not necessary to discuss them on /r/linux. There are other subreddits that are better suited for political discussions. Thirdly, political discussions can be divisive and can create a sense of "us vs. them" among users. This can lead to a lack of civility and respect among users, which is not conducive to productive discussions. Finally, political discussions can be a turn-off for new users who are interested in learning about Linux and open source software. They may be put off by the political discussions and may not want to participate in the subreddit. In conclusion, while it's important to be aware of political issues that affect the Linux community, I don't think that /r/linux is the right place for political discussions. There are other subreddits that are better suited for political discussions, and we should focus on discussing Linux and open source software on /r/linux.
