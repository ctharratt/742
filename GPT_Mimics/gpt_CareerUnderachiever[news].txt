The process seems simple enough: get a job, sign up for insurance through your employer, open up an HSA account if necessary, and blame politics if anything goes wrong. But here's the thing - the IRS can only fine you if you admit on your taxes that you don't have healthcare. All you have to do is check the box that says "yes, I am covered." It's a foolproof system, really.  But of course, a government-run program isn't working and costs more. Surprise, surprise. And if you're single, making 24k a year, and don't have kids, a mortgage, or other taxable write-offs, you don't get major subsidies. It's just the way it is.  Now, onto a completely different topic - police and K9 units. Did you know that if a cop pulls you over and doesn't smell drugs or see any items giving him probable cause to search your car, and you don't give consent, no search will occur? It's true. He cannot delay the length of the traffic stop to allow time for a K9 to arrive at his location to perform a search due to an officer's hunch. The Supreme Court ruled that the length of a stop is 20 minutes when no outside factors are involved.  But here's the thing - the article about the cop and the K9 unit didn't say the race of either suspect or cop. So they must both be white, right? It won't make national news because the country can't tell racism. And don't even get me started on the fact that K9s are trained to do a variety of actions when drugs are located or a scent is found, not just sit. And when a K9 officer uses his hands, what everybody is calling a "gesture," that is a guide for the dog's nose to sniff the door cracks, window jams, and wheel wells.  Moving on to a more controversial topic - Obamacare. My plan was perfect. It was great for me and affordable. Why should you determine it was useful or not? And talking multiple facts isn't moving the goalpost. You completely ignored the fact that this issue happened to millions of people with rates going up. My main issue is that I should not be on the hook to pay for other people's health insurance. No government should have the authority to cancel my private insurance and force me to buy through their exchange, which costs me more money, a portion of which goes towards other citizens' costs.  Millions of Americans' plans "didn't qualify." It was Obamacare's regulations forcing carriers to cancel low-cost plans and force Americans into more expensive insurance plans. And let's not forget Obama's promise of "you can keep your old plan and doctor," which was the biggest lie of them all. Same people covered, same coverage for the same things. I didn't add in anything new. "If you like your insurance plan you will keep it. No one will be able to take that away from you. It hasn't happened yet. It won't happen in the future." Obama 2010.  But here's the thing - citizens' insurance was dropped for new, more expensive plans and higher deductibles when it clearly was. And don't even get me started on the fact that Reddit is where nobody reads the article and upvotes don't matter.  And finally, let's talk about insurance in general. My car insurance covers the cost of getting hit by an asshole who doesn't have insurance. But my premium isn't a charity bill with a portion going to cover the premiums of those who can't afford auto insurance. Obamacare's cost came out of the middle-class pockets. Early on, my taxes went up slightly and then my insurance rates went up. I'm sick of paying more and more for those who aren't working or don't have insurance. And how about the self-employed? Under Obamacare, their insurance no longer met the criteria under new fed law, so they had to reapply for insurance, which cost hundreds more. This was all to give the uninsured insurance. It is not MY problem, and MY rates should not go up to cover anybody else. Should my car insurance rates go up to cover those who are uninsured too? When does it stop?  In conclusion, there are a lot of issues with healthcare, police procedures, and insurance. But at the end of the day, it all comes down to politics and money. And that's just the sad reality of the world we live in.
