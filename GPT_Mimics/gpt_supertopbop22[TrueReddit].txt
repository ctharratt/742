In today's world, politics and science are becoming increasingly intertwined, and this is having a detrimental effect on scientific research. The question of who gets to determine what can or cannot be said, what limits should there be, and what amount of subjectivity goes into those decisions is becoming more and more important. The problem is that these rules can be used to silence political enemies, and this is something that is happening more and more frequently. One example of this is Twitter's new Trust and Safety Council, which is using euphemisms to hide its reprehensible censorship. This is a worrying trend, as it means that people are being silenced simply because their views do not align with those of the people in power. This is not how a free society should operate, and it is something that needs to be addressed urgently. Another example of politics interfering with scientific research is the rise of left-wing extremists in Sweden. This is a worrying trend, as it means that people are being silenced simply because their views do not align with those of the people in power. This is not how a free society should operate, and it is something that needs to be addressed urgently. The problem is that politics is becoming increasingly polarized, and this is having a detrimental effect on scientific research. People are being silenced simply because their views do not align with those of the people in power, and this is not how a free society should operate. The rise of political correctness is also having a detrimental effect on scientific research. People are being silenced simply because their views do not align with those of the people in power, and this is not how a free society should operate. The social justice hysteria is so out of control that it is starting to affect the student's physical health, and this is something that needs to be addressed urgently. The Islamic State's new caliphate is also making gains in Northern Africa, and this is something that needs to be addressed urgently. The problem is that the government is dictating who can or cannot have a voice, and this is not how a free society should operate. The problem is that the government is dictating who can or cannot have a voice, and this is not how a free society should operate. This is why it is important to keep the government out of media as much as possible. The rise of Donald Trump marks a change in the Republican platform, and this is something that needs to be addressed urgently. Trump's pro-gay rights, pro-legal immigration, and anti-interventionist stances are winning over people in the Republican party that have rejected the Bush era. Hillary's campaign is facing a problem she never expected, she is running low on money as the Bernie Sanders campaign continues to plow Hillary into the ground. The Donald seems to be defying all known rules of politics as his campaign continues to rally against party corruption. A large part of the reason why European countries are able to offer such generous social welfare benefits is because the US is subsidizing the costs of their defense. The Europeans are not properly funding their own defenses while demanding the the US help them cover it, they then look down on us for spending so much on our military which we are using to protect them at very low cost to them. It is a terrible deal given to the US which Europeans use as a stick to cudgel us with as being ignorant militants. If the EU was forced to finally fund their own military without the US subsidizing them they would soon realize that their "progressive" societies with massive social welfare programs are no longer possible. Their liberal societies are only possible because the US has to cover a portion of their bill. Things like the niqab, chador, hijab, and khimar have been romanticized in some circles as being an ultimate sign of piety but these items have a darker side to them that is often overlooked. I oppose these ag-gag laws but I find it funny that an article about free speech is coming from a website like MIC.com as they have supported censoring people for having offensive opinion in the past and often censor the comments on their facebook page. I have had several of my comments deleted from their facebook page in the past. Science and politics are more interlinked than we think. This has had the unfortunate consequence of forcing scientists to filter their work through the prevailing politically correct lens of the time. This is not how science should operate, and it is something that needs to be addressed urgently. In conclusion, politics and science are becoming increasingly intertwined, and this is having a detrimental effect on scientific research. People are being silenced simply because their views do not align with those of the people in power, and this is not how a free society should operate. The rise of political correctness is also having a detrimental effect on scientific research, and this is something that needs to be addressed urgently. The government is dictating who can or cannot have a voice, and this is not how a free society should operate. It is important to keep the government out of media as much as possible, and to ensure that science is not filtered through the prevailing politically correct lens of the time.
