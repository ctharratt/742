It's not always about what men think or getting a partner. People need to feel good about and accept themselves. I think whatever anyone does to that end is fair. Like if a guy needs hair implants to feel good, I think that's ok, even if I think he looks smoking bald.  Sounds to me like your priorities are all in the right place. If your boyfriend isn't where you want him to be, that's disappointing... but maybe worth knowing. A lot of guys have no idea. They think women should a) be beautiful, and b) meet beauty standards "naturally" and invisibly. They don't want to know about what goes into it, the idea that women might put some effort into it is a turnoff, or like some kind of betrayal. (Some of them are even clueless about makeup.)  I think if he doesn't change his mind and it turns out to be a dealbreaker, maybe that's ok. Because it'd be way better to either be alone or with someone who's willing to support you and likes you for who you are. All that said, I bet he'd get used to them pretty quickly. I personally think going back to menstrual huts (but filled with pain meds and hot water bottles) would not be a bad idea. Yup it can. And you're not supposed to "give into it". Even other women, who don't have pain like that, judge you for being "weak". Like you're supposed to just soldier on like men and women without pain do. But yeah, very often, you just can't. Or you're operating at like 10% capacity.  I know some women hate the idea that menstruation can be disabling, because they don't want it to define them, or they want to be better than their bodies. But for some, that's just impossible. And going on birth control isn't really an option for people in high-risk groups. And even if you're not in a high-risk group, BCP - even the very very low dose ones - can make especially the psychological side so much worse. So your choice, effectively, is be crazy (or crazier) or suffer. I think anyone who needs a script for pain control should be allowed to have 1-2 days off a month, either as straight up disability, or time they can work off by staying late or working weekends, or some combination. (I don't think having to make it up is really fair, if it's actually disabling, which it is for a lot of people, but I can see employers having problems with it, and other coworkers resenting it [because they'll think it's a get out of jail card or whatever]. It is ~ 12-25 or so sick days - or lost productivity - a year.) OR at the very least scheduling things so you can just do busywork or whatever doesn't require effort at all on some of those days. I also think it's possible that on some atavistic level, like deep in the lizard brain, in the caveman brain, they might have found that kind of power exciting. After the fact. But even if they did, that doesn't mean they consented to it in the first place. Wtf, choking people on a date. I guess so: "“It happens all the time,” said Claudette Boulanger, a Toronto Rape Crisis Centre staff member. Boulanger has been counselling and advocating for survivors of sexual assault for 20 years. “We numb it out, or we pretend it didn’t happen, or we say nothing about it because we fear we won’t be believed,” she said. “Sometimes it’s hard for us to believe that happened. A lot of times we want it to go away, we want to normalize it.” Boulanger’s opinion is consistent with DeCoutere’s testimony. The Royal Canadian Air Force captain said her contact with Ghomeshi was an effort to “normalize” the assault. The trauma from an assault can be lifelong, which is why some women cope without acknowledging it, according to Boulanger. “Why would anybody want to deal with the feelings that would be coming up if you really accepted the fact that you had just been assaulted? That’s the rest of your life you’re going to be dealing with that,” she said. “So if for ten minutes or two years or a day you pretend this didn’t happen to cope, that makes sense to me.” Ariana Barer, a coordinator with the Vancouver-based Women Against Violence Against Women Rape Crisis Centre, said women should be supported and believed regardless of their behaviour after an assault. “There are many, many ways that people respond, and all of them are legitimate,” Barer said. “Women respond to sexualized violence differently, and have the right to choose their own path to healing and justice.” It's a kind of shock. They're literally blindsided. It doesn't make sense to them that a) this even happened, b) it happened to them, c) this guy they like for other reasons is really doing this to them. So they cordon it off from the rest of reality, and what they want to believe (because they did actually like him, it seems), and what they expect to happen. Because it's so crazy, so wtf, that someone would just pull your hair or smack you on a date, out of the blue, right? It must have felt like an unreal experience, far less real than everything else. I also suspect that to whatever degree they processed what happened, they might have hoped they could help him. Or discounted it, thinking it must be a one-off. Human beings are complicated. Maybe the other allegations are legit, I just can't wrap my head around going back out with and hooking up with a guy that sexually assaulted her. It happens all the time... people stay in live-in abusive relationships for all kinds of reasons that are not very well understood by people who haven't studied this or experienced it. These women's responses are well within the normal range of responses to trauma. Ah no way!! Yeah for sure, selection bias is likely part of it. Still, they end up with bumps on their noggins, and the NFL has got a role to play in managing exposure to risk - the players', and their partners' - or I think so! I'm talking about Ghomeshi and his lawyer. He hasn't actually denied assaulting these or other women. The strategy is just to try to tear the victims' characters to shreds. She won't put him on the stand because he'd have to admit he did horrible things. What? How is it irrelevant that a total stranger is imposing himself on you? Yeah, I'm talking about female experience, absolutely. I don't think everyone will agree with your assessment. Are you aware that there are dozens of women with complaints against him? Are you aware that he lost his job because he showed his ex bosses at the CBC a video of himself beating a woman until she had bruised ribs? (He thought it would vindicate him because it happened during a sex act and that this would imply consent. He thought wrong.) The stories aren't perfect because people aren't perfect. All this happened years ago. Doesn't mean he didn't assault them. Does every issue have a right side? Yup. Don't you mean "her opinions don't often line up with yours"? Nope. Yeah, all that makes sense. But you don't hear about this happening with baseball players, as much. Check it out: 76 of 79 dead football players were found to have degenerative brain disease on autopsy, following repeated brain trauma. It's thought the NFL also has to be highly motivated to cover things up.
