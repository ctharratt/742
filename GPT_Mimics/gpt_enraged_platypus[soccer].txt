Arsenal's Transfer Window: A Review The January transfer window has come and gone, and Arsenal fans are left with mixed feelings about the club's activity in the market. While there were some promising signings, there were also some missed opportunities and disappointments. Let's start with the positives. The signing of Mohamed Elneny from Basel was a shrewd move by Arsene Wenger. The Egyptian midfielder has been impressive in the Swiss league and in the Champions League, and he brings some much-needed depth to Arsenal's midfield. He is a versatile player who can play in a number of positions, and he has a good work rate and passing ability. At just Â£5m, he represents a low-risk investment for the club. Another positive was the return of Francis Coquelin from injury. The French midfielder had been out of action since November, and his absence was sorely felt by the team. Coquelin is a tough-tackling defensive midfielder who provides a shield for the back four, and his return will give the team a much-needed boost in that area. However, there were also some missed opportunities in the transfer window. One of the biggest disappointments was the failure to sign a striker. With Danny Welbeck out injured until February, Arsenal were left with just Olivier Giroud as their only recognised striker. While Giroud has been in good form this season, he cannot be expected to carry the team on his own for the rest of the season. The failure to sign a striker could come back to haunt Arsenal in the second half of the season. Another missed opportunity was the failure to sign a centre-back. With Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny both struggling with injuries this season, Arsenal were left with just Gabriel and Calum Chambers as their only other options. While both players have shown promise, they are still inexperienced and prone to mistakes. A more experienced centre-back would have given the team some much-needed depth in that area. One of the biggest disappointments of the transfer window was the departure of Mathieu Debuchy. The French right-back had been linked with a move away from the club for some time, but his departure still came as a surprise to many fans. Debuchy had been a solid performer for Arsenal last season, but injuries and the emergence of Hector Bellerin had limited his playing time this season. His departure leaves Arsenal with just Bellerin as their only recognised right-back, and there are concerns about what will happen if Bellerin gets injured. Overall, it was a mixed transfer window for Arsenal. While there were some promising signings, there were also some missed opportunities and disappointments. The failure to sign a striker and a centre-back could come back to haunt the team in the second half of the season, and the departure of Debuchy leaves the team short of options at right-back. However, the signing of Elneny and the return of Coquelin will give the team some much-needed depth in midfield, and there is still plenty of quality in the squad to mount a serious challenge for the title.
