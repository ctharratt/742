Hey there, I read your post and I have a few thoughts on the matter. First off, have you tried talking to her about it? Communication is key in any relationship, and if you're feeling uncomfortable or unsure about something, it's important to address it with your partner. Sit down with her and have an open and honest conversation about your concerns. That being said, it's also important to respect her boundaries. If she doesn't feel comfortable discussing certain topics or going into more detail, don't pressure her. Be there for her when she needs support, but also give her space when she needs it. I also noticed that you mentioned your life being miserable before you met her. It's great that she brings you happiness, but it's important to remember that your happiness should not solely depend on another person. You should strive to find happiness within yourself and your own life, rather than relying on someone else to provide it for you. As for the situation with your friends not doing any work, if you have proof, it's definitely worth bringing up to HR. However, if you don't have proof, it's still worth making a complaint and expressing your concerns. It's important to hold people accountable for their actions, even if it may be uncomfortable or difficult. Regarding your relationship with her, it's important to remember that you can't control their relationship. If you feel like you're just waiting around for their relationship to end, it may be time to create some distance and focus on yourself. You deserve to be with someone who wants to be with you and is fully committed to the relationship. I also noticed that you mentioned always cuddling at night and asking her if you were going to cuddle. It's important to respect her boundaries and not pressure her into physical intimacy if she's not comfortable with it. And it's definitely not okay to play dumb and ask her if you're going to cuddle after admitting to cheating on her. That's not fair to her and shows a lack of respect for her feelings. In terms of your beliefs about women not liking generous men, that's simply not true. Everyone is different and has their own preferences, but being generous and kind is generally seen as a positive trait. It's important to be yourself and not try to put on a facade or act a certain way to impress someone. Just be genuine and authentic, and the right person will appreciate you for who you are. I also noticed that you mentioned investing yourself into a man who has only recently become single. It's important to be cautious and not rush into anything too quickly. Take things slow and make sure you're both on the same page before getting too invested. As for the situation with your sister and her boyfriend, it's important to remember that everyone has their own reasons for their actions. It may be difficult to understand why someone is acting a certain way, but it's important to respect their decisions and not judge them too harshly. Regarding the situation with the used condoms and feminine products, it's definitely not okay to leave those things lying around and not clean them up. It's important to be respectful of others and their living space, and to clean up after yourself. In terms of your son and his girlfriend, it's important to set boundaries and not let them walk all over you. You deserve respect and should not tolerate disrespect from anyone, including your own children. It may be difficult, but it's important to stand up for yourself and show them that their actions have consequences. Lastly, regarding your feelings towards your future MIL and the new woman in your husband's friend group, it's important to try to look past your negative feelings and be open to socializing with them. It's okay to not like everyone, but it's important to be respectful and try to get along with others for the sake of your relationships with your loved ones. Overall, it's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner, set boundaries and stand up for yourself, and strive to find happiness within yourself rather than relying on others to provide it for you.
