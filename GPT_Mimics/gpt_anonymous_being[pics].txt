I mean, have you guys seen Downton Abbey? It's like, the best show ever. And don't even get me started on Bernie Sanders. I'm a Democrat through and through, but even I have to admit that for a Republican, he's not half bad. My sister-in-law Julie is totally the type of person who would do something like that. Actually, scratch that, I'm pretty sure it was her. And can we just take a moment to appreciate the importance of spaying and neutering our pets? It's like, the responsible thing to do. But let's talk about something a little more festive, shall we? Christmas is just around the corner, and I can't help but think of that classic line from Miracle on 34th Street: "But, Santy, are you sure that you are the REAL Santy Claus?" I mean, who hasn't questioned the authenticity of Santa at some point in their lives? And speaking of Christmas, how did you manage to get photos with all of those celebrities dressed up as elves? That's like, the ultimate Christmas wish come true. Oh, and have you guys ever been to the Corpus Christi aquarium? It's actually kind of cool. Gives me ideas for my next vacation. And that photo of the little girl crying? I just want to hold her and comfort her. It breaks my heart to see kids upset like that. And Kreth, my man, if you're feeling lost and unmotivated, just go out and expose yourself to new things. You never know what might spark your passion. And for anyone struggling with medical bills, here's a little tip: write to the hospital and explain your situation. They might just forgive your bill and use it as a tax write-off. No joke. But let's get real for a second. I can't help but notice that some of you seem to be struggling with eating disorders. And trust me, I get it. We all have our struggles. But if you're denying that your BMI is dangerously low, then maybe it's time to seek help from a medical professional. And for those of you who are concerned about a loved one's weight, approach the situation with kindness and understanding. It's not easy to admit that you need help. And can we just take a moment to appreciate the beauty of maple trees? They're so hot right now. And speaking of hot, I was really hoping that photo of Adam Levine would be shirtless. But I guess we can't have everything we want in life. Anyway, I'm just going to leave this here for anyone who needs to hear it: you are loved, you are valued, and you are not alone. Keep pushing through, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. We're all in this together.
