I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of her. It's not that I have anything against her personally, it's just that I've been conditioned to dislike her. It's like a reflex at this point. But I have to say, he's the only Republican I can stand. Rubio is too partisan and inexperienced, Trump is a complete idiot, and Carson has no experience whatsoever. And for some reason, I just can't bring myself to like Cruz. I don't know why, I just don't. But I have to agree with you, Kasich is definitely my second choice. He seems like a reasonable guy, and he hasn't said anything that makes me think he's completely insane. Plus, he's doing pretty well in the polls in Nevada, which is basically Iowa right now. I have to admit, I've been avoiding looking up his stance on gays. I really like him, and I don't want to ruin it. Ignorance is bliss and all that. But I bit the bullet and did some research, and I'm glad to say that he seems to be pretty reasonable on the issue. So yeah, Kasich for us. I love politics, but I have to say, I hope he doesn't microwave his lava cakes. I like them when they're sorta gooey so you can pick them up and eat them. The lava cakes are the best! Oh, and have you seen Parks and Recreation? There's this character named Greg Pikitis who's only in two episodes, but he's really cute. Not a movie, I know, but still. Anyway, I've been trying to get into writing lately, but it never really gets very far. I always end up typing because my handwriting is worse than awful. I'm trying to write a play right now, but I've only managed to write about a paragraph's worth. It's not going well. Kinda related, but I have this friend who I have a crush on. We went to the beach with a bunch of other people, and we ended up sharing a bed. One night, he randomly hugged me from behind while he was asleep. I was still awake, and I was very surprised in a very good way. I haven't mentioned it to him, though. I figure if he wants to talk about it, he will. Oh, and congratulations on getting into college! But unfortunately, now you have to get out. I know how you feel, though. I'm in a similar situation. I'm gay, and I can't imagine living like this for four more years. It's unimaginable. I've been trying to let it out by writing, but it only seems to make things worse. I'm most likely going to switch schools because I can't stand sitting in a classroom and being told that my feelings are awful sins. It's just awful. I have to keep all these emotions balled up inside me. I've done this before, though. When I found out that I was emotionally abused by a past teacher, I would cry for an hour or more alone. I've come to terms with worse things. But this is different. It's becoming impossible to live in the closet. I know the risks, but I just can't live like this anymore. If worse comes to worst, I have a cousin who I've told that lives about a mile away. I'm sure I could live with him if I had to. But I don't think it will come to that. My mom knows how much I've been through. She's seen me uncontrollably sobbing for an hour or more. I can't imagine her turning me out. She has a caring heart. Everything I've ever seen of her has shown this. She was physically abused by her ex-husband (who came out after they divorced). She's been through similar hardships as me, and I can't imagine her putting someone else, much less her own son, through them again.

I'm looking at Boston University, MIT, or pretty much anything in Boston. I'm also looking at Bloomsburg, University of Vermont, and American University. I haven't decided yet. As for music, I like pretty much everything except for rap, death metal, and most hip hop. Right now, I'm really into A Great Big World. They're amazing. I also love Disney movies. My favorite princess movie is Pocahontas, but I also adore Mary Poppins and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. I love all the songs from those movies. I wish I had someone to cuddle with. The only thing I have right now are my pets. It's not the same as having a person to cuddle with, though. Anyway, I think that's about it for now. Thanks for listening.
