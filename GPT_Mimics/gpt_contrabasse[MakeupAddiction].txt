"But why do you need an arrow that comes back to you after you shoot it?" I mean, seriously, why? It's not like you're going to run out of arrows in the middle of a battle and need to retrieve them. And if you're shooting at a target, just walk over and pick up the damn arrow. But hey, if Hawkeye wants to use a boomerang arrow, who am I to judge? The guy's a badass with a bow and arrow, deaf or not. Speaking of Hawkeye, can we just take a moment to appreciate how awesome he is? I mean, sure, he doesn't have any superpowers, but he's still out there kicking ass with the rest of the Avengers. And the fact that he's deaf just makes him even more badass in my book. Plus, he's got that whole brooding, tortured soul thing going on, which is always a plus in my book. But enough about Hawkeye, let's talk makeup. Specifically, lipstick. I don't know about you, but I'm always on the hunt for the perfect drugstore dupe for high-end lipsticks. And don't even get me started on the Revlon Ultimate Suede lipstick in Couture. Sure, the color is great, but that stickiness? No thank you. So if anyone has any recommendations for a satin/matte dupe, hit me up. And while we're on the topic of makeup, can we talk about glitter? I mean, I love a good glittery eyeshadow as much as the next person, but why do they always have to put that warning on the packaging about getting glitter in your eye? Like, is that really a common occurrence? And if it is, maybe we should all just stick to matte eyeshadows. But let's be real, who wants to do that? Moving on to hair, can we talk about how annoying it is when you don't notice how much your hair has grown until the sunlight hits it and suddenly you look like a golden retriever? And don't even get me started on forgetting to put on mascara. It's like, I wear thick black eyeliner every day, but if I forget the mascara, my lashes just look sad and brown. Thank god for glasses, am I right? But speaking of eye makeup, can we talk about how to make the most of our eye shape? As someone with hooded eyes, I know the struggle of trying to do a winged eyeliner without it looking like a hot mess. And don't even get me started on how a low wing can actually make the hoods look even lower. But fear not, fellow hooded eye sufferers, there are ways to make our eyes look amazing. For example, using eyeshadow instead of liquid liner can give the illusion of more lid space and make our eyes look less droopy. And don't be afraid to put shadow on the hood itself, it can actually make our eyes look more defined. But let's not forget about eyebrows. As someone with cool-toned hair, finding a brow product that doesn't make my brows look auburn is a struggle. And don't even get me started on over-drawing my lips. It's like, I love doing up my eyes, but when it comes to lips, I tend to skimp out. But hey, we all have our strengths and weaknesses, right? And finally, let's talk about hygiene. Specifically, the fungus and bacteria that can lurk on our lips. As someone who has suffered from this, I can attest to the importance of being careful with what we put on our mouths. Using a clean finger to apply lip products and sanitizing our toothbrushes can go a long way in preventing the stubborn fungus and bacteria from taking hold. So there you have it, my ramblings on makeup, hair, and hygiene. And while I may not have all the answers, I do know one thing for sure: Hawkeye is a badass.
