Hey there, I totally get what you mean about playing dumb in Firewatch. I mean, who knows what kind of crazy stuff could have gone down if we had revealed all of our knowledge too soon, right? And that scene with Delilah and the radio, man, that was intense. I definitely had the option to question her about it, but for some reason, I just didn't. Maybe I was too caught up in the moment or maybe I just didn't want to rock the boat. Who knows? But yeah, I totally agree with you about the ending of Firewatch. I mean, after all that build-up, I was really hoping for something big to happen. And meeting Delilah in person would have been the perfect way to wrap things up. But nope, we were left hanging. And don't even get me started on poor Henry's lack of social interaction. I mean, the guy was practically talking to himself for 77 days. That's just sad. As for Halo 5, I can definitely understand why long-time fans would be disappointed. I mean, after investing so much time and energy into the franchise, it's gotta be tough to see it go in a direction that you don't like. And yeah, the story and multiplayer both seem to have taken a hit. It's a shame, really. But hey, at least we've got some other great games to fall back on, right? Like Star Wars Battlefront and Elite Squadron. And speaking of Battlefront, I totally agree with you about the Homing Shot. That thing is just ridiculous. And don't even get me started on the camping pub rand days. We've all been there, my friend. And yeah, first person shooters are definitely my jam. I mean, I've been playing them since I was a kid. Goldeneye on the Nintendo 64 was my first introduction, and I've been hooked ever since. And now, I'm even competing in esports on Black Ops 3 with a team of friends from high school. It's crazy how far we've come. But sometimes, it's not just about the games themselves. It's about the social interaction that comes with them. Like you said, sometimes we just jump on PlayStation Party Chat for some good old-fashioned yarns. And hey, if you're ever in need of some social interaction, feel free to jump on with us. We're from New Zealand and Australia, so our time zones should line up pretty well with America. Anyway, that's enough rambling from me. It's been great chatting with you, and I look forward to playing some games together soon. Cheers!
