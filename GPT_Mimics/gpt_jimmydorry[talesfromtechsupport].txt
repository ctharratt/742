I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical when I first heard about the iDRAC upgrade for the r720XD. I mean, I already loved my iDRAC, so why bother upgrading? But after doing some research and talking to some colleagues, I realized that the upgrade was definitely worth it. One of the main reasons to upgrade is that the iDRAC can wear off over time, especially if it's raised. After a year or so, it can be difficult to see important information like credit card numbers or other sensitive data. You might have to feel it out or raise it at an angle to get a good look. That's not exactly ideal, especially if you're dealing with confidential information. But with the upgrade, you get a much clearer and more visible display. It's easier to read and you don't have to strain your eyes or fumble around to find what you're looking for. Plus, the tray closes smoothly and doesn't slice into your polystyrene cup (which is always a plus). Of course, there are other benefits to upgrading your iDRAC as well. For one thing, it can help you stay more organized and efficient. When you're taking tests or filling out forms, it's always a good idea to write your name first. But sometimes that can be confusing or ambiguous, especially if you're not used to it. With the upgraded iDRAC, you can easily keep track of your name and other important information, so you don't have to worry about getting mixed up or making mistakes. Another benefit of the upgrade is that it can help protect you from cyber threats like Cryptolocker. This type of malware can be incredibly damaging, and it's often difficult to detect or prevent. But with the upgraded iDRAC, you can use tools like CryptoPrevent to block executables and fake file extensions from running. This can help stop other malicious files in addition to Cryptolocker, and it can be a lifesaver if you're dealing with sensitive data or confidential information. Of course, there are always going to be some challenges when it comes to cybersecurity. Even the best antivirus software can't catch everything, and sometimes you have to make tough decisions about whether to pay a ransom or not. But in my experience, it's always better to err on the side of caution and take steps to protect yourself and your data. At the end of the day, the iDRAC upgrade is definitely worth it. It can help you stay organized, protect your data, and avoid costly cyber threats. So if you're on the fence about upgrading, I would definitely recommend giving it a try. You won't regret it!
