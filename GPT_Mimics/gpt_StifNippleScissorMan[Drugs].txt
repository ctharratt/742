The world of psychedelics is a strange and unpredictable one. As someone who has dabbled in various substances, I can attest to the fact that each experience is unique and often difficult to predict. Take shrooms, for example. I've had nights where I've taken 12 grams and been able to function (in a loose sense of the word), and other nights where 4 grams have practically rendered me comatose. It pays to err on the side of caution when it comes to these things. The effects of shrooms can be compared to snorting 250mg's of ketamine and laying down with a blindfold. At first, everything seems normal. I can see the inside of my room quite clearly. But then things start to get weird. I get absolutely floored. I can't walk, I'm too wobbly. I experience closed and open eye hallucinations. The world starts spinning. I hear music and voices. I get sick and vomit. It's a wild ride, to say the least. I don't smoke weed. It's too intense for me. But 12 grams of shrooms? Sure, let's party. However, I can't handle any decent dose of weed. It's just too much for me. Acid is another story. It's expensive and hard to come by where I live, but it's worth it. It's never totally risk-free, but it's about as close as you can get, at least for tabs of acid. They're usually handed out at sports events, like the one I said I was attending. They're used to inflate these things and make a loud as fuck clapping sound. The premium ticket is definitely worth it. Better seating, free food, free beer, goodie bag, all around good shit. All the signing sessions were in the premium area as well this year. But let's talk about the legal implications of these substances. I once had my house ransacked and the police found a bunch of shrooms. Under police questioning, the guy asked me if I planned on smoking them. It felt good being able to answer at least one of their questions honestly. It wasn't in my carry-on. It was inside a bookmark, in a book, in my suitcase. The day airport security starts ripping apart bookmarks in locked suitcases looking for drugs, I'll stop putting drugs in bookmarks in locked suitcases. I've also had my fair share of run-ins with the law when it comes to drugs. I was arrested at work, taken home, unlocked the door so they wouldn't have to break it down, then went in for questioning. I was charged with "import and possession of illegal narcotics with intent to sell." It wasn't a fun experience, to say the least. But let's not dwell on the negative. Let's talk about the good times. Like the time my group of 11 young, healthy-looking men drunkenly stumbled into a bar we soon realized was a gay bar. After spending about 5 hours showered in free drinks, both from other patrons and the bar itself, we stumbled back to the hotel, took a wrong turn, and ended up stumbling through the red light district. People in that district after 4 am on Friday nights aren't exactly "low key" about what they're selling. We stumbled past a fair deal of cocaine and heroin, but as we stumbled past the acid, I couldn't keep my wallet closed. Or the time I went to a music festival and tried nangs for the first time. Nangs are whippets, named so by the sound that pounds through your ears while you're fucked up on them. It was a wild experience, to say the least. But let's not forget the dangers of these substances. I once had a friend who took too much ketamine and ended up in the hospital. It was a scary experience for all of us. And then there was the time I took MXE three times before getting sick of it. It was all from the same batch, so it might have been a bad one. I haven't felt like trying again since. It's important to remember that these substances are not toys. They can be dangerous and unpredictable. But when used responsibly and in the right setting, they can also be incredibly transformative and enlightening. So, how high are you right now? Have you ever tried acid? Where the hell are you people getting acid? These are all questions I've been asked before. And while I'm happy to share my experiences and knowledge, I also want to stress the importance of being responsible and safe when it comes to these substances. In conclusion, the world of psychedelics is a strange and unpredictable one. Each experience is unique and often difficult to predict. It's important to err on the side of caution and to be responsible and safe when it comes to these substances. But when used in the right setting and with the right mindset, they can also be incredibly transformative and enlightening. So, let's continue to explore this strange and wonderful world, but let's do so with caution and respect.
