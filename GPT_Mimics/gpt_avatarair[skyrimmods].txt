As I delve deeper into the lore of Skyrim, I can't help but be fascinated by the Daedra and their role in the world. Some say they are simply amoral beings, but others claim they are pure evil. And then there's Sithis, the deity representative of emptiness and the void. Some sources say he is a representation of utter misanthropy. Sounds pretty bad to me. But where did the Daedra come from? Some say they came from Padomay, the embodiment of chaos and change. I knew she was cast down, but I never read any source where it says that her fellow magne-ge cast her down. It's all so confusing. What I do know is that the Daedra are not to be trifled with. They are demons with a different name that spawned from the embodiment of death. The only "good" one is the chick who was a magna-ge first anyway. Meridia was literally cast down from heaven for consorting with Daedra. If that doesn't scream "these daedra guys are pretty darn evil", then I don't know what does. And let's not forget about Molag-Bal, the Daedric Prince of domination and enslavement. The Daedric armor in-game is his, and he is absolutely a bad dude. So why shouldn't the armor signify that to some extent? It just seems weird to me when half of the Daedric quests in Skyrim involve acts of atrocity. But enough about the Daedra. Let's talk about magic. I love magic in Skyrim, but I wish there were more non-combat spells. Apocalypse has plenty, and so do most of Enai's mod packs. I know the Lillium follower comes with a mod that lets you "entangle" people in trees. Fire and Ice overhaul can be used to make an ice wall. And Gifts of the Outsider has a spell that summons rats that eat a corpse. How cool is that? But what about sneak attacks for magic? Please include sneak bonuses for magic besides runes. Especially for ice. If I can launch a quiet icicle into somebody with the speed and power of an arrow, I can aim for critical points while they don't see me. And let the warding buffs apply to shields with the warding enchant. That might seem silly, but it'd be a nice change. And while we're on the topic of magic, can we add the "wards reflect spells" mod to one of the perks? Perhaps ask for the author's permission, if it's required? I love the ability, but it seems a bit powerful on its own. I also love the single use perks, as long as they are at or near the end of a tree. The key to making them the magnum opus is to make sure that they don't have to be "waited for". But I do wish some abilities were gone from the Sneak tree. Please tell me that Wrath of Sithis is gone. That skill was too dang powerful to stack! And finally, I just want to say thank you to all the modders out there who put up with a lot of TLD and R&D for their mods. We genuinely appreciate it!
