Alright, let's talk about this whole chicken and dog situation. First of all, I have to say that I'm not clairvoyant either, so when someone talks about a dog and a chicken sharing a yard, my mind automatically goes to imagining the chicken running around freely while the dog follows it. And I have to agree with the criticism that maybe the original post didn't provide enough details about the situation. It's important to be clear about whether the dog and chicken are separated or not, especially if you're asking for advice on how to keep them safe. Now, I'm not an expert on dogs or chickens, but I do know that dogs have a natural instinct to hunt and kill small animals like chickens. It's not their fault, it's just how they're wired. So if you have a dog and a chicken in the same area, you're taking a risk. And if you value the chicken's life, you should take precautions to keep them separated. It's the same reason why I kept my cat locked in a separate part of the house when I had my cockatiel out of its cage. I didn't want to take any chances. And let's talk about the whole "fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me" situation. If your dog has already killed a chicken once, you should definitely take that as a warning and make sure it doesn't happen again. It's not fair to the chicken to put it in harm's way like that. And it's not fair to the dog to put it in a situation where it might feel the need to act on its instincts and kill the chicken. I also have to say that I'm not sure what the whole Google search by image thing has to do with this topic, but I guess it's always good to have that tool in your arsenal. And as for the resort in Thailand and the hot chicks, well, that's a whole other topic that I won't get into. Now, let's move on to the whole grilled cheese vs. melt debate. I have to admit that I'm not a huge fan of grilled cheese sandwiches, so I don't really have a dog in this fight. But I do think it's important to be clear about what you're calling something. If it's a grilled cheese sandwich, it should be just bread and cheese. If you add anything else, it's no longer a grilled cheese sandwich. It's a melt. And I can understand why people get passionate about this topic. Food is important, people! And speaking of food, let's talk about grocery shopping. I have to say that I'm a big fan of Walmart for groceries. Yes, I know some people have issues with the company and their practices, but when it comes to getting affordable groceries, Walmart is hard to beat. And let's be real, not everyone has a car or easy access to public transportation. So if you need to get a week's worth of groceries home, you might have to make multiple trips or find a way to transport everything. It's not always easy, but it's doable. And let's not forget about the importance of reading labels. I mean, if a shower head needs to label itself as "shock proof," that's a little concerning. But hey, better safe than sorry, right? And as for the person who asked if the woman in the picture is autistic, that's just rude. Let's not make assumptions about people's abilities or disabilities. Now, let's move on to some of the more random comments. I have to say that I'm a little confused about the whole potato situation. I mean, I've microwaved potatoes before and they've never turned out like charcoal. Maybe OP just had a really powerful microwave? Or maybe it's not even a potato at all? Who knows. And as for the person who thinks Ted Cruz looks like a serial killer, well, I can kind of see it. But I'm not sure if that's a fair assessment. And I have to say that I disagree with the comment about Trump looking the most presidential out of all the candidates. I mean, have you seen some of the things he's said and done? That's not exactly presidential behavior. And finally, let's talk about the person who posted someone else's picture and copied the top comment. That's just not cool. If you're going to post something, make sure it's your own content or give credit where credit is due. And let's not forget about the importance of originality. We don't need more copycats in the world. In conclusion, I think it's important to be clear about the details when asking for advice or sharing information. And let's not forget about the importance of respecting others and their opinions. And as for the whole grilled cheese vs. melt debate, well, I'll leave that up to the foodies to decide.
