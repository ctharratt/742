Diablo III is a game that has been around for quite some time now, and it has gone through a lot of changes since its initial release. One of the most significant changes that the game has undergone is the release of the Reaper of Souls expansion. This expansion has brought a lot of new content to the game, including new areas to explore, new enemies to fight, and new loot to collect. One of the things that I love about the Reaper of Souls expansion is the music. The music in this expansion is simply brilliant, and it really adds to the overall atmosphere of the game. It's not that the music in the original game was bad, but the music in Reaper of Souls is just on another level. It doesn't need to hide behind the likes of the music in Diablo II, which is often considered to be one of the best video game soundtracks of all time. Comparing the music in Diablo III to the music in Diablo II is like comparing two different cars. There are some cars where you can change the headlights without any problems, and there are some cars where you need to go to a garage to have that done. Both cars are totally fine, they are just built on different concepts. Both have their pros and cons. One is easy maintenance, one is not, but maybe needs generally less maintenance. You can't just go and compare stuff like this. Yes, it would be nice if it was possible to do something, but maybe adding that possibility would have downsides that you are not willing to have for comparably little benefit. That doesn't change the fact that they built the client and engine a long time ago, and it's not that easy to change stuff. But whatever. Not like making sense gets attention, but bashing does. It doesn't really prove anything. The fact is that Reaper of Souls is an entirely different game than Diablo II. It has a different engine, different client, different everything. And that's okay. It doesn't need to be compared to Diablo II, it can stand on its own. One of the things that I find challenging about Reaper of Souls is getting the secondary stat right. It's not just about having good gear, it's about having the right gear. For example, if you're playing a monk, you might have quite good gear, but you also need to have your OWE Lightning on most of the pieces. That's the hardest part. If you have the logout gear for it, you likely have the real gear when you're playing too. But even then, you might not be ranked at the top. I'm ranked at around 13k, and I know that I'm far from the top if that is my playing gear. As I said, my playing gear is at 150, and I am far from claiming here that I am the best geared monk in Europe. One of the things that I would really love to see in Reaper of Souls is another option for double legs or sets. Salvaging is just stupid by now, because Souls are not a rare commodity anymore. It would be nice to have another option for these items, but I understand that adding that possibility would have downsides that you are not willing to have for comparably little benefit. Another thing that I find frustrating about Reaper of Souls is the fact that +%Elemental Damage only affects the weapon glow. Only +%Elemental Damage affects skills. Because Wizards really need to be buffed? Also, "Alpha" client? That isn't something that usually is released outside of the company. Players would get a Beta client. Does sound all a bit weird. "Many" users is probably a bit too optimistic. Remember, not everybody is a hardcore Diablo III player. Even on this and the other Diablo III subs, you see people that have not enchanted their items and are running around with 150k dps. For them, it's a nice find. Sure it isn't great for you, but whatever. It'll make somebody happy to have some crit on it. In terms of the armory, I do think that it's a great tool for players to use. It offers all the character and more importantly item stats through the armory. This way you are able to get almost all of the info needed to build sites like diabloprogress or diablo3ladder. I do fully agree with what he said. I just don't think it's on their priority list. Working in development as well, I have seen enough mails about stuff like this being pushed back, because players have either developed an add-on with this functionality or there is a website that offers this. Blizzard is pretty open with their APIs for this reason. They let players do a big part of their job. You can see this in WoW as well with the massive add-on community on Curse. It would be really nice, but I don't have high hopes for that ever happening. One of the things that I find frustrating about Reaper of Souls is the fact that you need to log out with the new item and check your character on Diabloprogress to compare the stats. The old one works when equipped on your follower. I was doing the same until I read your question and thought about how stupid it was to block stash and inventory space for gems :/ You will loot those gems every time you play, and since they are stacking nicely, it would be wasted stash space to keep them there. You'll end up with the space blocked in your inventory again after a couple of minutes anyway, so you might as well keep everything in one place. In terms of gear, I have had some really painful experiences trying to roll for certain stats. For example, I went through 3 EotS and about 40m gold to get to 6%Crit. It was such a painful experience trying to roll 6%Crit on it. On my first one, I got it after 5 rolls, but the other stats were not that great. On my second one, I rolled until the rolls were at 2.5m/roll and I made it to 4.5%Crit 3 or 4 times, but never 6. I salvaged it then, because I was sinking way too much money into it. On my third EotS, I made it after it reached around 1.5m/roll, and finally, I am at 6%Crit. I have never seen Crit roll that bad on any other item. One of the things that I find frustrating about Reaper of Souls is the fact that the elemental damage is currently only giving the items a different look. The +%Fire affects your skill damage, not your weapon damage. %Damage on your weapon affects your weapon damage. In terms of performance, I have noticed that my frames drop in a full group. There is no "fix" for it. You'll need to get a new graphics card (and CPU while we're at it) or simply set your graphics a bit lower. It's all the same. The elemental damage is currently only giving the items a different look. The +%Fire affects your skill damage, not your weapon damage. %Damage on your weapon affects your weapon damage. In terms of gameplay, I find it frustrating that some people cheat their way up the ladder. There are currently no official ladders, but there are community ladders, and it sucks to never be able to get to the top because of cheaters. But overall, I still love playing Reaper of Souls. It's a great game with a lot of content, and I'm excited to see what Blizzard has in store for us in the future.
