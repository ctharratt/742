No doubt and no argument, I am a firm believer that animals should not suffer in order for us to eat them. It's just not right. I mean, sure, I'm not opposed to killing and eating animals, but we have to do it in a humane way. Animals have emotions and perceptions, just like us. We can't just treat them like property and disregard their well-being. And speaking of well-being, what about public displays of affection? I mean, sure, kissing in public is one thing, but when you start dry humping and moaning in front of the cereal aisle, that's just lewd conduct. It's illegal, and it's not fair to the other shoppers who just want to buy their Cheerios in peace. But let's talk about something more serious, like the field of medicine. It's a clusterfuck of society, really. We want the most altruistic people to be in charge of saving our lives, but instead, it's a career that attracts all the people who are interested in making the maximum amount of money, even at the expense of human life. It's just not right. And don't even get me started on lawyers. I mean, wouldn't it be great if we could all wish for lawyers who were absolutely fair and equitable in everything that they did? But no, we have to deal with the high cost of medical care and medicine, which isn't even really about research and development. It's just a way for big pharma to make more money. Speaking of money, what about that woman who said the person who planned the event should be shot in the head? That's just not right. Hyperbole has its limits, and we can't just go around saying things like that in public. It's dangerous, and it could lead to someone actually carrying out that action. But let's talk about something more positive, like being with your family. It's a benefit, no doubt about it. But what about those who can't be with their families because of immigration laws? It's just not fair. The red tape and money it takes to immigrate here is an insult to all immigrants, especially the ones who are good people who work hard and deserve a chance to thrive. And what about space? It's not just a single, physical object, but rather a cluster of nine massive galaxies bound together gravitationally. It's mind-boggling, really. But what can we do about it? Can we make a massive letter writing campaign or something? How do we get this guy to resign? And speaking of resigning, what about that Senior Deputy District Attorney who said he regretted keeping that man locked up? It's just not right. He probably said it after a nice dinner out with his family and friends, feeling all high and mighty. But what about the man who was locked up? He probably didn't have a nice dinner out with his family and friends. And what about cops? I mean, I'm a huge supporter of cops, but there are some bad apples out there. It's like in school or at work, there's always that one person who just doesn't pay attention and is bad at what they do. It stands to reason that there are some cops like that too. We just have to weed them out and make sure they don't hurt anyone. In conclusion, we have to be mindful of our actions and how they affect others, whether it's animals, fellow shoppers, or immigrants. We have to strive for fairness and equity in all aspects of life, from medicine to law to space. And we have to hold those in power accountable for their actions, whether it's a Senior Deputy District Attorney or a cop who abuses their power. It's not easy, but it's the right thing to do.
