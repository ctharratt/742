I never thought I'd be the type of person to use Tinder. I always thought it was for hookups and one-night stands, and that's just not my thing. But I figured, why not give it a shot? Maybe I'll meet someone interesting and we can go on a date or something. So I made my profile, trying to make it as genuine and interesting as possible. I included a few pictures of myself, including one in my ROTC uniform. I figured that might catch someone's eye, and it did. I matched with a girl named Logan. At first, I was excited. She seemed cute and interesting, and we had a few things in common. But then she messaged me, and it was all downhill from there. "Hey, wanna fuck?" That was her opening line. I was taken aback, to say the least. I mean, I'm not a prude or anything, but that's just not how I roll. I was hoping to get to know her a little bit first, maybe go on a date or something. But she was insistent. She kept sending me messages, asking me if I was interested in hooking up. I tried to steer the conversation in a different direction, but she wasn't having it. She just kept talking about sex. I started to get a little suspicious. Was this girl even real? I mean, she had an Instagram and a Snapchat, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything. Maybe she was just a bot, programmed to lure guys in with promises of sex. I decided to do a little investigating. I looked up her Instagram and found that she had over a thousand pictures. That seemed a little excessive to me. And her teeth looked like tombstones, which was a little off-putting. I also got the Snapchat of her and her "best friend." I put that in quotes because I'm starting to think that her best friend might actually be a guy pretending to be a girl. It's all very suspicious. I'm not sure what to do at this point. Part of me wants to just block her and move on, but another part of me is curious. I want to know if she's real, and if she is, what her deal is. Why is she so obsessed with sex? Does she have some kind of baggage that she's trying to work through? I'm also a little uneasy because I've never dated a girl before. I'm kind of bicurious, so I decided to check out the female area of Tinder. But I wasn't expecting to meet someone like Logan. I was hoping to meet a normal girl and go on a date or something to learn more about myself. But instead, I got a nympho. And not even a good one at that. She's not even that attractive, to be honest. I mean, I give myself an 8, and I'm definitely in her league, but I'm not ripped or anything. And my bio is way more interesting than hers. I guess I'm just disappointed. I was hoping for something more meaningful, and instead I got this. It's not that I'm against casual sex or anything, it's just not what I was looking for. And the fact that she's so insistent on it is a little creepy. I'm going to play detective tonight and see if I can figure out the true identity of this human Barbie and her "best friend." Maybe I'll find out that they're both bots, or maybe I'll find out that they're real people with some serious issues. Either way, I'll update tomorrow with my findings. In the meantime, I'm going to keep swiping. Maybe I'll find someone who's a little more my speed. Someone who's interested in getting to know me, not just getting in my pants.
