Let's start with Australia. I mean, how did they even write that name? Is there some kind of translator online that they used? I'm just surprised that it's considered a developed country. I mean, sure, by GDP PPP, China has a larger GDP, but if you look at nominal GDP, the US has a clear lead. And let's be real, nominal GDP is a more common way of comparing the size of national economies. GDP PPP per capita is more useful in seeing how much activity there is per person than Nominal GDP per capita, but China isn't even number one in either of those categories. So, what's the deal with Australia? And then there's Serbia. I mean, what even is that? I'm just being a typical Canadian, acting like I know everything, but I had no idea that Serbia had zero miles of coastline. Meanwhile, Montenegro could theoretically have thousands of miles of coastline if we used a really, really tiny measuring stick. But let's not get into a dick measuring contest here. Russia doesn't win just because Ukrainians are more miserable than them. Food insecurity is a real issue that affects Russia and concerns many. I mean, have you seen the statistics? It's not at Sub-Saharan African or North Korean famine levels, but it's not an insignificant issue in Russia by any means. And speaking of Russia, let's talk about Stalin. I mean, the guy was accused of trying to cleanse the USSR of certain troublesome minorities by purposely mismanaging the distribution of food, causing millions to die from starvation. That's even more people than died at the hands of the Germans in the Holocaust. And yet, some people still think that a Stalinist government in France would have been a good idea. Are you kidding me? France has been better off in the long term under American influence than it would have been as a Soviet satellite state. And why would Stalin even do that? They were seeking independence from his rule. The USSR wasn't exactly ethnically homogenous, nor did everyone absolutely love one-party totalitarian communist rule. There's a reason why when it collapsed, a bunch of new countries formed. And let's not forget about Burkina Faso. I mean, holy crap, I didn't even realize that country existed. Am I just being an ignorant 'Murican here? And what about Indonesia? Weren't they the Netherlands' colony? I mean, sure, that doesn't change the fact that the famine was caused by human actions, but still. And don't even get me started on the whole Puerto Rico situation. It's problematic because there's nothing even resembling a consensus in Puerto Rico as to what their status in relation to the rest of the US should be. In a 2012 referendum, a majority of Puerto Ricans wanted some kind of change to the status of Puerto Rico, but only a small percentage of them wanted outright independence. So, what's the solution here? And finally, let's talk about the US. As someone who took AP US History just three years ago, I can tell you that we learned about all the negative things in our dark past. We learned about the Japanese internment camps, the Trail of Tears, the hypocrisy of the founders, American war crimes in Vietnam, and many more. We even had a debate about whether the US should have carried out the atomic bombings. And let me tell you, we came to the conclusion that the bombs were the best option in terms of saving American and Japanese lives if you think the US really had to push for the total surrender of Japan. The only other option to achieve this goal would have been a far more catastrophic invasion. But we certainly weren't taught that it was an act of defense. That doesn't even make sense. If your history teacher really said that, he/she should get another job. Seriously. A bad AP teacher can cause students to lose out on a shitload of money saved.
