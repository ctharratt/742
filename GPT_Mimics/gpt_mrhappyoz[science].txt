Hello there! Thank you for sharing your thoughts and articles on cannabis and cancer treatment. It's always interesting to learn about new research and potential treatments. I also appreciate your advice on weaning off SSRIs. It's important to do so gradually and with caution to avoid unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Regarding your celiac disease, I understand your desire to fix the problem and not sugarcoat it. It's important to acknowledge and address health issues, but it's also important to accept and love ourselves for who we are, flaws and all. It's a balance that can be difficult to achieve, but striving for both can lead to a happier and healthier life. I agree that life is short and we should enjoy what we have. And it's great to hear that inducing labor can promote neurogenesis and lymphatic vessel function in the brain. Dietary modifications can indeed make a big difference in treating depression, especially when food allergies are present. It's interesting to learn about the role of inflammation and neurogenesis in depression treatment and the potential for dietary supplements to promote these processes. I do want to address your use of the term "broken" to describe individuals with autism. While it's true that autism can present challenges and difficulties, it's important to remember that individuals with autism have unique strengths and abilities as well. They are not "broken" or flawed, but rather different and valuable members of society. And while treatments for autism are important, it's also important to accept and celebrate neurodiversity. I also appreciate your point about planned pregnancies and the importance of adjusting treatment around birth and breastfeeding. It's important to weigh the risks and benefits of medication use during pregnancy and make informed decisions. The presence of pharmaceuticals in drinking water is indeed concerning, and more research is needed to understand the potential health effects. It's important to consider alternative medications for depression that do not fall into this category. I'm sorry to hear about your acute allergy to gluten and the difficulties it has caused. Prebiotics like inulin can indeed be helpful in repopulating gut flora and addressing bowel issues. Marketing techniques can certainly influence human behavior, but it's important to remember that rodents and humans have different responses to certain stimuli. It's important to be aware of gluten content in foods, as not all rice noodles are gluten-free. And the discovery of lymphatic vessels in the brain does raise interesting questions about potential treatment methods. Overall, I appreciate your insights and perspectives on various health topics. It's important to stay informed and open-minded about potential treatments and approaches to health and wellness. Thank you for sharing your thoughts!
