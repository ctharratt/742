Gaming has become a huge part of my life, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I've been playing video games since I was a kid, and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. Lately, I've been obsessed with Xenoblade Chronicles. It's all I can think about, even when I'm at work. I find myself browsing the Xenoblade subreddit during my breaks, and I can't wait to get home and play some more. I've already spent a lot of money on this game, buying all the DLC and extras. I know some people might think it's sad, but I don't care. This game has captured my attention like no other. The story is engaging, the characters are well-developed, and the gameplay is addictive. I can't get enough of it. That being said, I do have some criticisms. The side quests can be a bit dull, and some of the deaths in the game feel meaningless. But overall, I'm having a blast playing Xenoblade Chronicles. It's definitely one of my favorite games of all time. But Xenoblade Chronicles isn't the only game I've been playing lately. I've also been diving back into Fallout 3. While I don't think it's as fun as Xenoblade, I still enjoy the game. The world is immersive, and I love exploring the wasteland. However, the story and side quests can be a bit lackluster at times. I've also been playing Just Cause 3, and I have to say, I'm impressed. The game is a blast to play, and the explosions are incredible. The map is huge, and there's always something to do. However, the repetitive missions and boss fights can get a bit tiresome. Another game I've been playing is Bloodborne. This game is hard. Like, really hard. But I love a good challenge, and Bloodborne definitely delivers. The atmosphere is incredible, and the boss fights are intense. I'm still working my way through the game, but I'm enjoying every minute of it. One game I'm not too sure about is Soma. I was excited when I heard it was rumored to be free-to-play, but now that it's a full-priced online-only game, I'm not sure if it's worth it. The reviews have been mixed, and I'm not sure if I want to spend that much money on a game that might not be that great. Speaking of money, I've been eyeing the Shadow of Mordor season pass. I already platinumed the game, but I'm curious if the DLC is worth coming back for. I've heard some good things, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price. One thing I love about gaming is the community. I've made some great friends through gaming, and I love discussing games with other people. Whether it's on Reddit or in person, I always enjoy talking about my favorite games and hearing other people's opinions. Of course, gaming isn't perfect. There are always bugs and glitches, and sometimes games are released before they're ready. But I don't think that's a reason to stop playing. Developers are constantly releasing patches and updates to fix these issues, and I think that's a good thing. Overall, I think gaming is a great way to unwind and have fun. It's a hobby that I'm passionate about, and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. Whether I'm playing Xenoblade Chronicles or Bloodborne, I always have a great time.
