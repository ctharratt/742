Drawing blood is one of the most dreaded experiences for me. I have veins that are too close to the skin, making it difficult for the phlebotomist to find the right spot. I always tell them to go through my hand or below my wrist, but they never listen. Instead, they try to find a vein in my arm, leaving me with several bruises. It takes them a few tries to get it right, but they never seem to be freaked out. I think they're just looking for the right spot. I remember one time when I had to get my blood drawn, and the phlebotomist couldn't find a vein. She tried several times, but each time she failed, I could feel the frustration building up inside me. Finally, she found a vein, and I let out a sigh of relief. But the relief was short-lived because the needle hurt like hell. I tried to distract myself by thinking of something else, but it didn't work. I just had to endure the pain until it was over. Drawing blood is not the only thing that makes me cringe. Doing drugs such as smoking meth is another thing that I find repulsive. I don't understand why people would want to put something so harmful into their bodies. It's not worth the risk. Instead, I prefer to indulge in something sweet, like M&Ms. Party City sells a bunch of different colors, and I love trying them all. Speaking of food, have you ever heard the saying, "you are what you eat"? Well, I used to work at a grocery store as a cashier, and one time, an item that was regularly priced at $2 rang up as $30. Luckily, it was a small order, and both the customer and I didn't even notice until the total came up. I was so confused. It just goes to show that you have to be careful when you're buying food. When it comes to fashion, I like to mix things up. I wear wigs, and they're called "quick weaves." So technically, everyone is right. But sometimes, people make assumptions based on what they see. For example, one time, I was wearing a wig, and someone said, "I love your hair." I didn't correct them because I didn't want to embarrass them, but it just goes to show that you can't always judge a book by its cover. Speaking of judging, have you ever heard of the Rhubarb Lady? She's a woman who became famous for her bizarre behavior in a grocery store. She was caught on camera yelling at the employees and throwing rhubarb at them. It's a strange story, but it just goes to show that you never know what someone is capable of. On a more serious note, I once had a guinea pig that I loved dearly. He would pick all the snakes he ate clean and leave the bones together perfectly in the yard. I cried when a wild hog killed him. R.I.P. Paul <3 It's amazing how attached we can become to our pets. They become a part of our family, and when they're gone, it's like losing a loved one. But let's switch gears and talk about something more lighthearted. Have you ever seen the show Bar Rescue? There's an episode where the owner of a bar called Headhunters is afraid of water. It reminded me of the type of person who can't swim and gets thrown in the shallow end of the pool and over-dramatically does the "oh shit, I'm drowning" swim. It's funny to watch, but I can't imagine being that afraid of water. Speaking of things that make me uncomfortable, I always see these posts of cats on counters and in cupboards, and everyone thinks it's funny/cute. But I just can't help but picture catbox paws all over my food. Am I the only cat owner that thinks this is gross? I love my cat, but I don't want her paws on my food. When it comes to personal grooming, I recently got a new mohawk, but I had bad aim, and I'm a very hairy female. During a show, my back hair caught on fire due to all the hairspray I used. The whole club smelled terrible for hours, and I couldn't get the smell off me. Burning hair is a terrible, terrible smell. But let's talk about something more positive. I love blowjobs, and in my house, every week is blowjob week. All my partner has to do is ask, or the usual whip it out and start walking towards my face dick first while I'm on Reddit. It's all about having fun and being open with your partner. Speaking of being open, have you ever tried pegging? It's a sexual practice where a woman wears a strap-on and penetrates her male partner anally. It's not for everyone, but I'm a fan of it. And speaking of anal, have you ever accidentally nailed your testicles to your work desk? I haven't, but I know someone who has. But let's talk about something more practical. Have you ever used a menstrual cup? It's a cup you put up your twat to catch your nasty bloody mess, and you clean it out and reuse it later. It's a great alternative to tampons and pads, and it's better for the environment. And speaking of tampons, have you ever used compact tampons from Tampax? They're designed to be as little and discreet as possible, but the wrappers tend to open themselves magically, leaving exposed tampons lying about your purse for you to accidentally grab while paying your tab at the bar. But let's talk about something more serious. Have you ever been in a situation where you needed help but didn't know how to ask for it? It's a common problem, and it can be especially difficult for children. That's why it's important to teach kids to ask for help when they need it. Being a kid is all about having fun, but it's also about learning responsibility. And speaking of responsibility, have you ever had to clean up after someone else's mess? It's not fun, but it's a part of life. I remember one time when I was a janitor, and every Friday, I was supposed to clean out containers and leave things in there like lunchables, which were still good. The other janitors just ate everyone's shit. But let's talk about something more positive. Have you ever seen a giant teddy bear? They're amazing, and I suddenly find myself in need of a Costco membership and more space for giant bears. And speaking of space, have you ever heard of a sandbox? It's a place where kids can play and have fun, but I don't understand what it is exactly. Is it a term for when someone shoves a ripe banana in their smurf? Because that's what I'm seeing. But let's talk about something more important. Have you ever been in a situation where you needed to press a button for assistance? It's a common occurrence, but it can be frustrating when you're on the other end of the situation. I remember when I was a kid, and they had just installed buttons at the Home Depot near our house that said, "press for assistance." I pressed every button I passed, but now that I'm an adult, I realize that it's not as fun. In conclusion, life is full of ups and downs, but it's important to find humor in the little things. Whether it's a funny story about drawing blood or a serious discussion about asking for help, we can all learn something from each other. So let's keep the conversation going and continue to share our experiences.
