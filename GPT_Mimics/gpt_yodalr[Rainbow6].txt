As a dedicated player of Rainbow Six Siege, I have to say that I am extremely disappointed with the state of the game. It seems that Ubisoft has released a half-finished product and is now asking players to throw in more money to get the other half or fully commit themselves to this one game. This pay-to-win scheme is really bad for casual players who may not have the time or resources to invest in the game. The game has potential, but that potential is being thrown away by bad management at Ubisoft's side. The infamous "match making error" is still a major issue, and it seems that Ubisoft is not doing enough to fix it. Players are still getting kicked out of matches, and the game is still not optimized for AMD cards, which results in microstuttering and FPS drops. Furthermore, the game's matchmaking system is broken, and it seems that Ubisoft is not doing enough to fix it. Players are still getting matched with players who are much higher or lower in skill level, which makes for an unfair and frustrating experience. The abandon match penalty is also not harsh enough, as players are still quitting after the first round, which ruins the experience for everyone else. The game's pay-to-win scheme is also a major issue. It seems that Ubisoft is more interested in making money than in creating a fair and balanced game. The fact that players have to buy operators with in-game currency or real money is ridiculous. It takes 25k renown to unlock one operator, which is a lot of time and effort for casual players who may not have the time to invest in the game. This is not fair to players who have already put in the time and effort to buy the game. Ubisoft's response to these issues has been lackluster at best. They have promised to fix the matchmaking system and optimize the game for AMD cards, but it seems that they are not doing enough to address these issues. Players are still experiencing the same problems, and it seems that Ubisoft is not taking their concerns seriously. In addition to these issues, there are also a number of bugs and glitches in the game that need to be addressed. For example, the "headphones glitch" makes it too easy to headshot Blitz while his shield is up. This is not fair to players who are trying to play the game as it was intended. Overall, I am extremely disappointed with the state of Rainbow Six Siege. It seems that Ubisoft is more interested in making money than in creating a fair and balanced game. The pay-to-win scheme is a major issue, and the matchmaking system is broken. Ubisoft needs to do more to address these issues and to create a game that is fair and enjoyable for all players.
