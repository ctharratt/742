I'm not accusing anyone of anything, but let's be real here, the system is flawed. It's like a broken record, playing the same tune over and over again. And don't even get me started on the justice system. One judge sends a black kid to jail for 20 years for doing the same thing as a white kid, but with less casualties. It's like they're not even trying to hide their bias anymore. But let's not dwell on the negative. We need to focus on our health. Eat right, stay away from meat, move regularly, and do regular check-ups with your doctor. And most importantly, have a positive outlook on life. I know it's easier said than done, but we have to try. If we're lucky enough to not get killed or sick, reaching 81 won't be that hard. And who knows, by the end of the 20s, we might even have 3D printed organs. That could add an additional 20 years to our lives. Can you imagine that? Living to be 101? It's mind-boggling. But then there are people like the one I was arguing with earlier. They think they know everything about everyone's lives. They're so stubborn, it's like talking to a brick wall. They're the type of people who spend all their time on the internet because they can't handle the real world. It's pathetic, really. I mean, sure, they might have had some life experience, but that doesn't mean they know everything. They're so ignorant, it's like they're living in their own little bubble. And they have the nerve to accuse me of being emotional? Please. And don't even get me started on the church burnings. Seven black churches burned down in four days, and some people still refuse to believe it's racism. It's like they're in denial or something. I mean, come on, it's not a coincidence. It's not like this has happened before. It's obviously a hate crime based on race. And then there are people who think that intelligence is solely inherited. Like, seriously? It's not that simple. Sure, genetics play a role, but environment is just as important. People with lower socioeconomic status are less intelligent, and that's a fact. Just look at the SAT scores. The lower a child's family income, the lower their score. And then there are people who think that Chinese people are just naturally smarter than everyone else. Like, what? It's not because they're Chinese, it's because their culture values education more than others. It's been that way for centuries. Chinese kids have more pressure from society and their parents to succeed, and they spend more time on homework. It's as simple as that. But of course, there are always people who refuse to see the truth. They're so blinded by their own ignorance and prejudice that they can't see the forest for the trees. It's sad, really. In conclusion, we need to focus on our health, both physical and mental. We need to be aware of the flaws in our system and work to fix them. And most importantly, we need to be open-minded and willing to learn. We can't let our own biases and prejudices cloud our judgment. We need to see the world for what it is, not what we want it to be.
