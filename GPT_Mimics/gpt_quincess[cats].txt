Hey there, folks! So, I've been having a bit of a rough time lately with my kitty, Cleo. I swear, it's like she's been cursed or something. First, she gets a UTI and is diagnosed as clinically dehydrated. Turns out, she had stopped drinking out of her water dishes and was only drinking puddles out of the bathtub. Who knew cats could be so picky about their water sources? Anyway, we got her on antibiotics and she seemed to be doing better, but then the UTI came back. Now we're talking about other potential problems like diabetes, FUS, and stress. It's a lot to handle, but I'm just trying to stay positive and hope for the best. But enough about Cleo, let's talk about some other cats! I recently rescued a not-so-feral kitty and it's been such a joy to see her come out of her shell. She's still a bit skittish, but she's slowly starting to trust me and it's the best feeling in the world. And don't even get me started on my other cats. They may drive me crazy sometimes, but I wouldn't trade them for anything. My fluffy cat used to try and wipe away my tears when my mom was dying, and my dog would try to comfort me by giving me his paw (even if he ended up punching me instead). They're my little angels and I love them to pieces. Speaking of angels, have you ever had a cat that just seemed to have a sixth sense about things? Like they could sense when you were upset or needed comfort? I had a cat like that growing up. She was a trap and release female who showed up in our neighborhood abused and losing her hair from anxiety. But she found us and would bring us worms (yes, worms) and eventually we let her inside. She was a constant shadow and fixture on my mom's lap until she passed away. Now she lives with my boyfriend's parents and has made a drastic dent in their mouse population. She's also forced her new mom into providing a warm lap to sleep in. Cats, man. They're just the best. And let's not forget about the importance of grooming our furry friends. My Lorelai is experiencing some really bad matted fur from her ribs on down and I've been contemplating giving her a lion cut. But I have no idea how I would get it done without losing a limb in the process. Has anyone else had to deal with this? Any tips or tricks would be greatly appreciated. But enough about cats for a second, can we talk about vets? I have the most amazing vet who would never let money get in the way of saving an animal's life. When my coworker's sheep flock got attacked by dogs, he spent hours in the field trying everything he could to save them. Unfortunately, they all died, but he didn't even charge her for half of the stuff he did. That's the kind of vet we should all strive to have. Anyway, I think I've rambled on enough for now. Just remember to always look on the bright side of life, even when things seem tough. And give your furry friends an extra snuggle for me.
