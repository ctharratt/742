So, I recently had an experience with booking a hotel room through Expedia and it was a complete disaster. The hotel was sold out, but I was able to book a room through Expedia. When I arrived at the hotel, I was told that there were no rooms available and that Expedia had never sent my reservation to the hotel. Needless to say, I was extremely frustrated and disappointed. This experience has made me realize that booking directly with the hotel is the way to go. It all seems very fishy to me. I'm not sure if there is anything legally that can be done, but I do believe that bad press can go a long way in making a company change their ways. People get upset about anything these days, so if enough people speak out about their negative experiences with Expedia, it could make a difference. If other employees at the company start feeling uncomfortable and not trusting their employer, that could also put pressure on them to make things right. In terms of employment, I recently had a discussion with HR about how PTO is calculated for salaried employees. They were including weekends in the calculation, which I believe is incorrect. Industry standard for salaried employees is to divide your salary by 2080 hours (2 weeks vacation and 50 weeks (2000 hours worked). Since you can only use PTO on weekdays, there is no reason to count weekends in the calculation since it isn't counted when you get paid. If you took PTO during weekdays, you would be paid $192/day, so that is what you should be paid. I pushed back on HR and asked them how people normally get paid on PTO when they use it. They eventually fixed it, but it was frustrating to have to fight for what was rightfully mine. Moving on to a different topic, I recently found out that my sister hit someone's car and she didn't have a license at the time. The other person didn't have insurance either. While it may be the other person's fault that my sister hit their car, she is still liable for the damages. According to NJ laws, driving without a license can result in a fine or imprisonment for not more than 60 days and $200. On the other hand, failure to carry motor vehicle insurance coverage can result in a fine and a period of community service as determined by the court, and suspension of driving privileges for 1 year. If it were me, I would try to keep this out of a police report and avoid going through insurance. The penalties for driving uninsured are much worse than those for driving without a license. In terms of housing, I recently had an issue with my landlord. I suspected that someone had been entering my apartment without my permission, so I asked my landlord to install security cameras. He refused, so I took matters into my own hands and installed them myself. I also called the authorities to report the issue. It's important to protect yourself and your belongings, especially when you suspect that someone is entering your home without your permission. Moving on to employment again, I recently had a situation where a new hire was being trained during my shift. While I understand that training is important, it was frustrating to have to work during the day when I am used to working at night. I'm not sure how long the training will last, but I do like where I work and they have been accommodating for my goals. If it's a one-time thing, I can put up with it for a bit until I am put back onto night shift. In terms of legal issues, I recently received a call from a telemarketer. I added my number to the do not call registry, which makes it illegal for them to call me. If they continue to call after that, I can ask where they got my number and threaten them for violating the policy. I can also file a complaint against their number and the government will take it from there. Moving on to car repairs, I recently had some work done on my car and I was not satisfied with the results. I got a list of what they said they repaired and found that some things were not fixed. While I can't blame them for charging a high price for work or selling other 'repairs', I can fight back if they didn't complete the work to the standard expected. In terms of travel, I recently had to change my flight and was charged a rebooking fee. While all airlines do this, it's still frustrating to have to pay extra money for something that was out of my control. I changed my trip to March, but it's still annoying to have to deal with these fees. Moving on to a different topic, I recently had a situation where someone was pulled over and asked for a urine sample. They were on medication that could show up in the sample, but it was for therapy purposes. They were unsure of what to do and asked for advice. If it were me, I would be up front with the authorities and explain the situation. If they see it show up in the sample, there is a chance they will allow it to slide since it is for therapy purposes. Lastly, I recently had a conversation with someone who wants to have a child but is concerned about the cost. While I understand that having a child can be expensive, I also believe that it's important to consider the emotional and psychological costs as well. If they are unable to conceive, there are other options available such as adoption or surrogacy. If they do decide to go the route of surrogacy, it's important to have a notarized contract that proves it was not intended to be a parent and that they accept no responsibility for the child. In conclusion, these are just a few of the issues that I have dealt with recently. While some of them may seem trivial, they can still be frustrating and time-consuming to deal with. It's important to stand up for yourself and your rights, whether it's in the workplace or in your personal life. Don't be afraid to speak out and make your voice heard.
