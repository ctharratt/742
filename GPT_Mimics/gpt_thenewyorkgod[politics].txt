I think many Americans have a valid claim when it comes to the issue of taxes. If a rich person is required to pay 90% of anything earned over a certain amount, say $10,000,000, is there really any incentive to try to earn more? Why would I want to raise my income from 10 million to 20 million, if I will pay $9 million in taxes on that second $10 million in income? It just doesn't make sense. But let's move on to a completely different topic - acne. As someone who suffers from acne, I recently bought an acne scrub that had those tiny scrubbing heads. Holy shit, they must have gotten into my pores and stuck there because I had the worst acne breakout ever and needed some kind of chemical peel to treat it. It was a nightmare. On a more serious note, I recently discovered a website called goodrx.com that saved me a lot of money on my wife's medication. With insurance, her meds were $280, but I found a coupon on that site that brought it down to $58. I was amazed. It almost seems like a borderline treasonous act that the pharmaceutical industry charges such exorbitant prices for medication. Speaking of money, did you know that the US Government gives out $30 billion a year in Pell Grants to lower-income students? It's already in the business of paying for college, and if they motivate state colleges to reduce their ridiculous high tuition, a major chunk of this plan is already paid for. We can also shut down the thousands of for-profit diploma mills that take the full Pell Grant towards their $20k a year tuition in exchange for worthless degrees. That Pell money can now be diverted to community and four-year state colleges where it will actually make a difference. But let's talk about the cost of living. A 25% increase in the cost of goods is a huge increase. A $4 gallon of milk is now $5. That is nothing to sneeze at if you live paycheck to paycheck (making $15 an hour). It's a real struggle for many Americans. Now, let's talk about Pope Francis. He's like the Pope Francis to all the previous Popes. He got rid of the diamond-crusted thrones for a simple chair, got rid of the gold-leafed robes for a simple cloth one. He's a breath of fresh air in the Catholic Church. But what about state colleges? What did they used to have that they don't have now? "Pay equity for women"? I thought that was a myth? Women do make the same but tend to work fewer hours overall, stay in the workforce for a shorter period of time, etc. Moving on to healthcare, are you sure there are no costs associated with a single-payer insurance system? Has the structure of this single-payer insurance been revealed yet? It's always described as "Medicare for all" - well, for anything other than a hospital stay, Medicare pays 80% of the bill, with NO out-of-pocket maximum. If you have $80,000 in chemo treatment under Medicare, you pay $16,000. It's still a good thing, but not the panacea everyone is describing. And what about big pharmaceutical companies? They do not refuse to cover meds or require pre-authorization. Your entire rant was misdirected and should be aimed at the insurance companies. Let's talk about Jewish firefighters in Lakeview. They are not refusing anything. They are simply going off duty on the Sabbath to avoid being put in that situation. In many situations, a Jew will break Shabbos to save a non-Jew. No one is disputing that. What I am asserting is that it is technically against the halacha to do so. The Torah places a lower value on the life of a gentile. It is only through the 'wisdom' of the rabbis, who found many loopholes to allow the violation of Sabbath to save a non-Jew. Now, let's talk about insurance companies and pre-existing conditions. A child born with a condition is NOT a pre-existing condition. If a child is born with a condition and their parents have insurance, they would be covered. Before healthcare reform, a pre-existing condition was defined as a diagnosed condition for which you had received medical treatment within the past 12 months. Huckabee is a jackass, but no newborn baby was ever denied insurance because of a medical condition they were born with. Finally, let's talk about Kim Davis and her refusal to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Her "religious freedom" excuse is invalid. If part of her religion is to pick and choose her religion, then that is her religion! Her exact speech, word for word, would have been given 60 years ago by a clerk refusing to issue marriage licenses to interracial couples. In conclusion, there are many issues facing America today, from taxes to healthcare to religious freedom. It's important to stay informed and engaged in these issues, and to always strive for a better future for ourselves and our country.
