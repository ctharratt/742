And I totally agree with that. I don't understand why I'm getting downvoted for expressing my opinion. I mean, I never said it was a bad game, I just didn't connect with it like I did with the others. Maybe it was my own fault, I played all the games back to back, so by the time I got to Bloodborne, I was burnt out. It didn't give me that same sense of awe and accomplishment that the previous games did. I mean, I came to Bloodborne after playing Dark Souls, leading up to its release, and I loved both of them. So, naturally, I picked up Dark Souls 2 when it came out. But, I ended up returning it. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game, it just doesn't have the same appeal as the other two. Plus, I hated how quickly the durability of weapons would degrade. Wait, what do you mean it's over if you die? I was worried about the same thing, but there's definitely more after the wet nurse. I mean, there's a bit more after that fight, and you're prompted with a choice that makes it pretty obvious when it's the "end." You can also try checking to see if your save was automatically backed up on the PS home screen before it put you into NG+ if you weren't done yet. What do you mean that's it? Because you still have some more to do. You're not the only one. I talked to her in the sewers and haven't seen her since. I've been to Father Guacamole's room, and she wasn't there. I've even been outside of the Cathedral Ward, and there was nothing. I have no idea where she is, but I'd like to have her armor. My girlfriend told me to take a break from Bloodborne because I was getting so damn mad. I've been stuck on the Blood Starved Beast for the greater part of today. I've tried using the blunderbuss and different strategies, but I always get so close, and then he manages to catch me with his one-shot ability. I'm getting so frustrated. I mean, I played through Dark Souls before Bloodborne came out, so I had some experience going into it. But, Bloodborne, while amazing and such a great game, is pissing me off like no other. I got Bloodborne this morning as soon as Gamestop opened their doors, and I made a character within five minutes. I went out with my girlfriend and got some coffee, and then we came home, and I've been glued to the TV ever since, watching Modern Family. I think I might be in the minority, but I'm okay with that. Tomorrow, I'll be playing Bloodborne again! My PSN is Bastuvian, and my usual play time is North America/1pm to 9pm CST. Some days vary, but that's the most typical. I'm a casual player who enjoys exploration, farming, and PvP. I'm open to it all. I have no idea what my class build is because I've avoided looking at it, so I don't really know what's out there. And yes, I use a mic. I tend to be pretty quiet at first, but after a bit, I'll open up. I've been having an absolute blast playing through Dark Souls 1 on the PC for the first time. I have the hard copy of Anatole Banco Ledwidge, and I like having the physical item. I mean, what's my age again? Yeah, it took me longer than it should have to click in my head. But, since I'm unemployed at the moment (unless I find a job before then, which I'd love), I'll have my ass planted on the couch from the time of release until whenever I go to sleep. Overall, I think Bloodborne is a fantastic game, but it just didn't resonate with me like the others did. Maybe it was my own fault for playing them back to back, but I still think it's a great addition to the Soulsborne series.
