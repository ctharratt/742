Oh boy, where do I even begin? I mean, seriously, do Americans even know what's going on outside of their own country? They're so obsessed with their Kardashians and Kanye West that they don't even realize they can't even leave this planet without the Russians. And now China is even building companies in the USA because it's cheaper to produce there than in China. But do they care? No, they still think they're the center of the universe. And don't even get me started on their so-called "freedom." The guy said "free" and not "freedom," but even then, the USA is not special and far behind a lot of other countries in terms of being the most free nation. I mean, look at the Native Americans who still have to live in reservations and aren't even allowed to speak their own language in school. And let's not forget that the USA has 25% of all prisoners in the world combined. Sacrifices made? More like damn pathetic Americans. And what about their history? They only went to war when Germany was already defeated in WWII, just to seize landmass because Soviet Russia was going to overrun Europe. They did it to save the money they made in WWII and all their debts. And let's not forget that they sold weapons to all sides while others bled. And now they have the audacity to act like they're the heroes of the world. But let's talk about something else, like the fact that if you don't have papers in the USA, cops can fuck you very hard. And this is normal everywhere in the world. When officials ask you who you are, you have to identify yourself, even on airports, hospitals, banks, or whatever. And why don't they use drones against gang members? Some gangs in the USA are so big as ISIS. But no, let's just bomb the Middle East into oblivion and mass murder innocent people so they have to run for their lives. And don't even get me started on American sports. American football and baseball? Who cares? No one in Germany cares about them. No TV channel ever supported American football, and there's nothing about it in any newspaper. It's just not interesting. And let's not forget that Trump says people from a special religion are less worth than others. But outside the USA, no one cares about it. It's the same way the USA cares about soccer. And let's talk about Germany. We stopped the Romans 2000 years ago, had Napoleon on his march to Russia, and even though our country got bombed to the ground in WWI and WWII, we came back stronger than ever. We will still be here when the USA is a thing of the past. And let's not forget that our "Autobahn" here in Germany was built by Hitler and National Socialism. So much for the USA's theory that they're the only ones who know what freedom is. And let's not forget that hate speech is not allowed in Germany. It's allowed to discuss everything, but there's a big difference between discussing and spitting out pure hate on people. You don't have true freedom of speech when you can't accept how other people handle it. We Germans just don't allow Nazi low brains to spread their hating bullshit. We learned our lessons 75 years ago, and we don't need US cowboys to teach us something about "freedom." Seriously, we are far above Canada and Mexico. And let's not forget that the USA is destroying their own continent. They're fracking it to shit, burning California in a gas cloud, poisoning the population with toxic water, spreading cancer with nuclear waste (St. Louis), and GMO food. They're making the USA the next Mad Max world. But we Germans will still be here, strong and proud. So, in conclusion, Americans need to wake up and realize that they're not the center of the universe. They need to stop obsessing over their Kardashians and Kanye West and start paying attention to what's going on in the world. They need to stop acting like they're the heroes of the world and start taking responsibility for their actions. And they need to stop thinking that they're the only ones who know what freedom is. Because, let's face it, they don't.
