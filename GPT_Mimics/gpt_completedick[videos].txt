I'm not sure about that. They seem pretty messed up. Even to this day. How do you think Elon Musk feels? He probably got high just one last time. The trick to falling safely is to ragdoll and try to absorb as much of the impact as possible with your head. Nobody stay in the same place for more than a handful of minutes! From the design of the gun, doesn't the first dart have more power than the 2nd and 3rd? The cascading airflow will cause the piston to work against more air (which will compress) the further along in the system the dart is. One in which a "WIDE LOAD" sticker isn't mandated by law. That's just the government's cover-up story. Definitely was a UFO bro. /s Edit: adding a "/s" so you dummies get the sarcasm. The government is doing a mass cover-up. Tin hats on people. I think the use of the word talent makes people feel better about themselves. The belief that you've failed or cannot succeed where others have because they had talent (the natural ability to do something) where you don't. Talent and skills should be synonymous. You can get good at ANYTHING with enough practice. It's possible that someone is a little better at something due to a genetic predisposition, but if you work harder than them, your handicap (in regards to their ability) can be overcome. So you're very much like this girl. You think that talent is something that you're born with. It's not. Talent takes a lot of hard work and practice. If you're told all your life that you're the "best", you have no reason to strive to be the best. You've already got it in your head that you have that position on lock and end up making a fool of yourself on live TV like this girl. But his hand is attached to him. That is the result of being told you're talented and beautiful all your life when you don't possess either quality. Incredible cover. I wish it was recorded in an echo-proof room to get the full experience. I've seen Asian people run from black people working for an Asian charity where I live. Hey. When will I see you at the next KKK meet-up? And yes! Damn the police! not really but it makes my argument sound more convincing. You could literally purchase a PC that is 85% as good as this one for 1/3 the price. No need for ice cream. I feed off your denial. I don't think you understand the concept of an insult. You're making up things that make you feel better. I'm attacking you based on facts your life that you have to deal with on a daily basis. I'm sure it pains you to think about how lonely you are. Being single while others are happily dating or married. How women react to you attempting to have a conversation with them. How they're instantly put off by your outside appearance. How you've had to find a tiny niche to fit in because you don't feel accepted elsewhere. I have some advice for you. Lose some weight and find the first girl that'll allow you to stick your dick in her and marry that she-beast of a manatee. Whatever makes you sleep at night you fat fuck. She worked at a school where the kids didn't tuck their chairs in all the way when they left the classroom. Basically the same thing. Too funny how I could tell you're obese based on your shit mentality. You're fat not because of what you eat or how little you exercise. It's because your mindset is content with your condition. Bet you're one of those "I only eat things that taste good" kind of guys. Then wonder why you're obese. That's my oxygen, and I want it back. In my mind, I imagine blowing two balloons. One balloon you put your lips around the neck and are able to inflate it to a point of bursting. The other you inflate it by blowing from an inch away. I very much doubt the second balloon would inflate much. Wouldn't the air pressure inside the inflatable be exactly that of the outside? With valved designs, you're able to use your lung, mouth, or mechanical blower's strength to increase the pressure of the air bladder making whatever it is you're blowing up more comfortable to use. I'd imagine the sleeping bag blown up in the video would have your body touching the ground in areas. The plastic is usually tied down, and then debris put on top to weigh it down. It'd get tattered, but it should hold up to most of what nature can throw at it. And I try to do it every other year with some friends. It's liberating to be out in the wild. And we always carry emergency supplies with us. The reason why you want the optimal shelter is that you're usually situated out away from civilization. If you get injured (broken leg, etc.), it could be your home for a while. Imagine you're in that shelter, and a thunderstorm forms coming from the typical westerly direction (as would most in this part of Germany). You have a choice of two shelters. One with its opening facing West with a ~1m wall and another with its opening facing east with a similar wall. Which would you choose? Which would best aid in your survival? Edit: I feel as though you're defending choices this lady made with no practical knowledge of survival. Germans don't misspeak. Also, everything is possible if you make assumptions. It's better to use the information provided than to make up reasons why she's correct without evidence to support it. I wasn't trying to discredit this lady's abilities. I was calling out the guy above me for creating misinformation. I checked into her videos, and they're quite good, and I hope it inspires more women to get into this kind of thing. I'm not sure why people are upvoting you. Your reasoning doesn't make much sense. She could have built the sheltered portion in the opposite direction to the same effect as well as having wind and rain protection. Plus, the wind is going to blow smoke and embers into her living space. Even with the walls that she has erected. I think she made a mistake. Which is fine. She doesn't have to survive there. You feed it, give it a home, play with it, and show it love. Aren't you doing that already? You said dog. I said people. I'm confused how you think I somehow stole your joke. People need to train their dogs better. It's cute the first time, but these dogs have ownership over the TV when something is on they find stimulating. I feel the same way about people that watch "Let's Play" videos. I guess if that's what you're into. edit: I guess all the SJWs live on the front page of Reddit. Interesting how I went from +20 to -9 as soon has this post got promoted. Congratulations on going out of your way to feel emotionally distressed over a comment on the internet. Maybe you need to be on some of those painkillers so you can lighten up a bit. Why don't you live by your word and let some of these refugees into your home? I skipped though and then laughed when I saw the tennis ball drop because it was overly predictable. Does this make me a bad person? If anything, it will do the complete opposite. The bomber had a sick sense of humor. Translated to American: After driving 26 miles in our trucks, we got to this sissy bridge we had to cross by foot.
