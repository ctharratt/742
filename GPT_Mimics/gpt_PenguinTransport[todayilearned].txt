I have a story to tell you about a piece of movie memorabilia that I have in my possession. It's a poster for the movie Revenge of the Jedi, and it's legit. How do I know it's legit? Well, let me tell you the story of how I came to own it. Back in the early 80s, I was working for a company that was involved in the movie industry. I won't say which company it was, but let's just say that they were a big player in the game. One day, my boss came to me and told me that we had received a shipment of posters for the upcoming movie Revenge of the Jedi. He handed me one of the posters and told me to keep it safe, as it would be worth something someday. At the time, I didn't think much of it. I was just happy to have a cool poster for a movie that I was excited to see. But as time went on, I started to realize that my boss may have been onto something. You see, Revenge of the Jedi was the original title for the third movie in the Star Wars trilogy. However, George Lucas decided to change the title to Return of the Jedi, as he felt that revenge was not a Jedi-like quality. So, what does this have to do with my poster? Well, it turns out that the posters with the original title of Revenge of the Jedi are quite rare. Once the title was changed, the posters were recalled and destroyed. However, a few managed to slip through the cracks and make their way into the hands of collectors. Now, I'm not a big collector myself, but I do appreciate the value of rare items. So, I decided to do a little research on my poster. I found out that there were a few different versions of the poster, depending on where it was distributed. Mine happened to be the "Style A" version, which is the most common of the Revenge of the Jedi posters. Even though it's not the rarest version, the poster is still worth quite a bit of money. I've seen them sell for anywhere from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars, depending on the condition and authenticity. And since mine is in excellent condition and I know for a fact that it's legit, I could probably get a pretty penny for it if I ever decided to sell it. But honestly, I don't think I ever will. The poster has sentimental value to me, as it reminds me of a time when I was young and excited about the latest Star Wars movie. Plus, it's just a really cool piece of movie history to have in my possession. I've had the poster for over 30 years now, and it's still in great shape. I've kept it stored away in a safe place, away from sunlight and moisture, to ensure that it stays in good condition. And every once in a while, I'll take it out and admire it, remembering the excitement I felt when I first saw it all those years ago. In conclusion, my Revenge of the Jedi poster may not be the rarest or most valuable piece of movie memorabilia out there, but it's still a treasure to me. It's a reminder of a time when I was young and full of wonder, and it's a testament to the enduring popularity of the Star Wars franchise. And who knows, maybe someday it really will be worth a fortune. But for now, I'm content just to have it as a cherished possession.
