As a long-time player of Space Engineers, I have to say that the recent updates and developments have been nothing short of amazing. The addition of puppies as companions was a nice touch, although I have to admit that I'm not a fan of shooting them. However, the real excitement for me lies in the development of the survival mode. Keen has already done a lot to develop the systems, but to really get people playing and not just building, we need a survival mode full of features and lifeforms. And it looks like the recent updates are the start of a big push to flush out the gameplay. I have to say that I'm excited to see where this goes. One of the things that I love about Space Engineers is the ability to build awesome things in space and on planets. And with the ability to mod just about everything, the possibilities are endless. Keen is right to push survival mode development right now, and I wish them all the luck in the world. Let's have an awesome 52 patches in 2016! I have to say that following the development of this game has been a blast. The weekly updates and videos are a great way to keep people hooked and give streamers and YouTubers fresh ammo for content creation every week. And the huge support of the modding community that Keen has shown is just amazing. The success of the workshop is a testament to the great project that Keen has created, and they truly deserve this win. I'm still learning things in single player mode right now, but the idea of a great server like the one mentioned in the comments is definitely appealing. And that dude at the end who suggested using a rotor to create a perfect circle? He's a bad ass. As a PC enthusiast, I have to say that it's great to have the modding community pushing the envelope while Keen is free to work on stabilization of systems and improvements for the modding community and core system features. It seems like almost every other update is something that increases what modders can do, and that makes watching the development of this awesome game even more fun to be a part of. I have to admit that I'm not up to the challenge of creating some of the amazing mods that I've seen, but I love the fact that there is so much power available to the modding community. It's really great that such things are possible. One question that I have is whether it's possible to add worlds to an existing easy start survival save. I'm on earth starting out, but I would love to import a bunch of player-made planets into my world. Ideally, I would like to have a universe that is populated by player-made worlds, and as new ones come onto the workshop, I would be able to simply add them into my universe. Is this or something similar possible right now? And speaking of the workshop, the idea of mobile gaming in your cockpit while on the long trip to the moon is definitely intriguing. But the first one to put Flappy Birds on a cockpit LCD gets a piston to the knee. I have to say that I'm thankful that Keen takes the time to make a video at all. I follow other companies that have no problem going dark for a year and leaving you guessing what they are working on. And the fact that Keen is so open about their development process is just amazing. I love seeing the cool ships made by fellow players, and the bad ass targeting missiles are definitely a nice touch. And to the person who asked whether Keen would integrate a bunch of the really well-done and popular mods into the base game for the next anniversary? That's a great idea. I don't think Keen really puts a lot of weight in the terms "alpha" and "beta." I can't be bothered to look it up, but I'm pretty sure I've seen a quote to the effect of "We don't care if we ever come out of alpha and are quite happy to just keep doing what we have been doing." And honestly, I would be perfectly happy if they did just that. I have to admit that sometimes Keen slips rather big changes in from time to time and doesn't make a note of it or overlooks getting it into the video. But that's part of the fun of following the development of this game. And finally, to the person who created the data sheets for the game? Thank you. It's things like this that really make this sub wonderful. And to the person who is about to start creating new creations? Congrats, and I can't wait to see what you come up with. Overall, I have to say that Space Engineers is an amazing game, and the recent updates and developments have only made it better. The modding community is thriving, and the support from Keen is just amazing. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game.
