Increasing the level of enemies in Skyrim can have a significant impact on gameplay. It can make fights more challenging and rewarding, but it can also have some unintended side effects. As someone who has spent countless hours modding and tweaking Skyrim to my liking, I have some experience with this. One of the most common side effects of increasing enemy levels is increased health regeneration. This can make fights drag on for much longer than they should, especially against bosses and other tough enemies. For example, Miraak, the final boss of the Dragonborn DLC, has notoriously high health regeneration. This can make the fight incredibly frustrating, as it can take a long time to whittle down his health bar. To fix this, I had to make some tweaks to the game. I removed Miraak's health regeneration completely, which made the fight much more manageable. However, it was still a tough fight, as Miraak has a lot of other tricks up his sleeve, such as powerful spells and shouts. Another issue that can arise from increasing enemy levels is that some enemies may become too powerful. For example, dragon priests are already tough enemies, but if you increase their level too much, they can become nearly impossible to defeat. They have powerful spells, high health, and can turn your own summons against you. To address this, I reduced the health regeneration of priests and made some other tweaks to their AI. This made them still challenging, but not impossible to defeat. It's all about finding the right balance between challenge and frustration. One of the most rewarding aspects of increasing enemy levels is that it can make fights more strategic. You can't just charge in and hack and slash your way through enemies anymore. You have to think about your tactics and use your spells and abilities wisely. For example, I found that using Banish Daedra is incredibly effective against Lurkers and Seekers. These enemies are weak to frost, so using a basic ice spell can also help keep their health regeneration down. It's all about finding the right combination of spells and tactics to take down tough enemies. Of course, increasing enemy levels is just one aspect of modding Skyrim. There are countless other mods out there that can enhance the game in different ways. For example, I love using Frostfall and Campfire to add a survival aspect to the game. It makes the game much more immersive and challenging, as you have to worry about things like hypothermia and hunger. I'm also excited for the upcoming Last Seed mod, which promises to add even more depth to the survival aspect of the game. It's always exciting to see new mods and updates that can enhance the game in different ways. Overall, increasing enemy levels can have some side effects, but it can also make the game more challenging and rewarding. It's all about finding the right balance and tweaking the game to your liking. With the right mods and tweaks, Skyrim can be an incredibly immersive and enjoyable experience.
