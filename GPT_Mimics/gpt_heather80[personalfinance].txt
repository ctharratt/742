Well, well, well, here we are again talking about cars and finances. It seems like everyone has an opinion on what the best option is, but let me tell you, it's not always black and white. I mean, sure, getting a used car for $5K might seem like a good deal, but it's also a risk. You never know what you're going to get, and the person who suggested it was lucky they didn't end up with a lemon. And let's be real, you don't even know me, so why get so upset about my decision? I know some people have this dogmatic view about car leases, but that's fine. I made the best decision for me. I considered getting a used car, but without a substantial down payment, it just wasn't a good option. And let's not forget that the size of the car payment is not the only thing I care about. I also care about reliability, interest rates, and other factors. I wasn't going to do anything that couldn't save me a lot of money per month. And I definitely wasn't going to do anything that would end up costing me more than what I owed on my previous car. So, financing a nice used car over several years and saving maybe $100 less per month would have been a bad move for me. Leasing is almost never a good option, but in this case, it was the best option for me. Yep, I understand that is the black and white ideology around here. It's why I didn't even consider a lease initially in 2012. But had I done a lease on my car I just traded in, I would be $10K richer today. Hindsight is 20/20, right? I have a tendency to second guess myself, which is what I was doing yesterday when I posted, but I know I made the best decision for myself in order to be out of credit card debt in a few years. I absolutely could have found a $4000 car that I could have paid off in two years at 180 a month. I just did a search for those specifications. Here's an optimistic forecast: It would have been at least 10 years old with almost 200,000 miles. If I conservatively budget $1000 for upkeep and repairs over two years, and the car actually lasted that long, after two years I am out $5320. I could probably sell it at that point for $2,000. So it costed me $3320 to drive that vehicle for two years. Now, let's compare that to leasing a brand new car. It is costing me a $1,000 more to drive a brand new car over the same two year period. 1000/24 is $40 bucks a month, and my piece of mind (not risking getting a lemon) and comfort are worth that to me. A very cheap used car is a gamble....and one that doesn't make sense to make when you know nothing about cars, your household depends on that one car running every day perfectly, and you have a child to think about. And let's not forget that I have a finite amount of money each month. I have three things I can do with that money: 1) build savings/emergency fund 2) pay off cc debt 3) save for a new car. It's a bit tricky to discern what to prioritize, but I'm leaning toward building the savings up to one month of living expenses and then aggressively paying down debt. I mean, who wants to be in debt forever, right? Now, I know some of you might be thinking, "But, what about the long-term cost of leasing a car?" Well, let me tell you, I've thought about that too. Not knowing what type of vehicle this was or is now at the end of three years, I would assume it would still be worth about $5000 or maybe a little more. Let's say that's true. Paying off the car would have costed me $8500 more in addition to the lease payment over the next 29 months. So wouldn't you rather have $8500 in 29 months than a car worth $5000? I couldn't afford the car payment for the next 29 months if I wanted to be aggressive with paying down debt or building a savings account. As I explained, I don't see a private dealer giving me thousands of dollars above blue book value. Another dealer may have given me a little more trade-in value, and I could have made a greater down payment on the lease. But the lease was still going to be the better option for me in the short term. Sure, I could have continued to make a huge payment each month for 30 months, and yes I would have had a car without a payment...but I would have $9000 less money to pay off debt or build savings during that time period, and now is when I need that money. You may look down on that, and that is totally fine. I got myself into this situation, and I can't really circlejerk "leases are bad" my way out of it. And let's not forget that I am a foster parent and in the process of adopting my foster daughter. Unfortunately, adopting her is going to cost me a lot of money, because I lose the stipend from the state for her care. But I love her and I want to give her permanency. She's lived here over a year. I can't have a roommate with a foster child in the house, and I probably wouldn't want a roommate for my daughter's safety. So, there you have it. My decision to lease a car might not be the best decision for everyone, but it was the best decision for me. I'm not saying it's the right decision for everyone, but it was the right decision for me at this point in my life. And let's not forget that everyone's situation is different. What works for one person might not work for another. So, let's all just take a deep breath and remember that we're all just trying to make the best decisions we can with the information we have.
