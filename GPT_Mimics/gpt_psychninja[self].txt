Wow, I just read your post and I have to say, I am blown away by your honesty and vulnerability. It takes a lot of courage to share your struggles with the world, and I commend you for that. I can relate to so much of what you're going through, and I want you to know that you're not alone. First of all, let me just say that I think it's amazing that you had that moment of clarity with the paper airplane. It's those little moments of awareness that can be the catalyst for change. And I love that you're asking yourself what you'll do the next time you find a paper airplane. It shows that you're thinking about the future and how you can make positive changes in your life. I also want to say that I understand what it's like to struggle with college. I dropped out twice before finally graduating, and it was a long and difficult journey. But like you said, failure is not a life-long title. It's situation-specific. And just because you've struggled with college in the past doesn't mean you can't succeed in the future. It's all about finding what works for you and taking things one step at a time. I think it's great that you're considering taking time away from school if you need it. It's important to prioritize your mental health and well-being, and if that means taking a break from school, then that's okay. And who knows, maybe taking some time to explore life and figure out what you really want to do will lead you down a path you never expected. Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room: alcohol. I'm not going to debate whether or not you're an alcoholic, because that's not the point. The point is that you're experiencing alcohol dependence, and that's something that needs to be addressed. I'm so glad that you're seeking help and considering a medically supervised detox. Withdrawal from alcohol can be dangerous, and it's important to have professional support during that process. But detox is just the first step. It's important to have a plan in place for after detox, whether that's attending AA meetings, going to rehab, or exploring harm reduction strategies. The most important thing is that you're taking steps to address your alcohol dependence and work towards a healthier, happier life. I know it's scary to think about the future and all the unknowns that come with it. But I truly believe that you have the strength and resilience to overcome these challenges and come out on the other side. You've already taken the first step by reaching out for help, and that's something to be proud of. Remember, you're not alone in this. There are people out there who care about you and want to see you succeed. And even though it may not feel like it right now, there is hope for a brighter future. Keep taking things one day at a time, and know that you have the power to create the life you want.
