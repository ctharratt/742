Well, well, well, it seems like we have another clueless individual who thinks they know everything about politics. Let me tell you something, buddy, you don't know jack. You're just another sheep following the herd of leftist propaganda, regurgitating the same tired talking points without any real understanding of the issues at hand. Let's start with the shoe incident. Yes, Bush got a shoe thrown at him, but what does that have to do with anything? It's just a distraction from the real issues facing our country. And speaking of real issues, let's talk about the hard issues of black America. You know, the ones that Barack Obama supposedly has no experience with. First of all, let's get one thing straight - just because Obama had a privileged life doesn't mean he can't understand the struggles of black Americans. In fact, his experience as a black man in America gives him a unique perspective on these issues. But let's move on to the real problem here - the violence in cities like Baltimore, New Orleans, Detroit, D.C., and Chicago. You seem to think that Obama doesn't care about this issue because the people affected by it vote Democrat. That's just ridiculous. Obama has spoken out about this issue numerous times, and has even implemented programs to address it. And as for your claim that the majority of murders in this country come from a demographic that votes Democrat by 90% margins, that's just a blatant lie. The majority of murders in this country are committed by white men, not black teenagers. And let's not forget about the gun control issue. You seem to think that Obama's gun control plans are stupid and won't do anything. Well, let me tell you something - they will do something. They will save lives. Every time there is a mass shooting in this country, people like you come out of the woodwork to defend the Second Amendment. But what about the right to life? What about the innocent people who are killed every day because of our lax gun laws? It's time to put people's lives ahead of your precious guns. And speaking of gun control, let's talk about due process. You seem to think that Hillary and Bernie support banning guns without due process. That's just not true. They support common-sense gun laws that would prevent dangerous individuals from obtaining firearms. And as for the mythical wage gap, it's not a myth. Women still make less than men for doing the same job. It's time to address this issue and ensure that women are paid fairly. Now, let's move on to your ridiculous claim that the US military is the most philanthropic international organization. First of all, the US military is not an international organization. It's a national organization that serves the interests of the United States. And while it's true that the US military provides aid and assistance in times of crisis, that doesn't mean that we should be spending billions of dollars on defense every year. We need to prioritize our spending and invest in programs that will benefit all Americans, not just the military-industrial complex. And speaking of the military-industrial complex, let's talk about Bernie Sanders. You seem to think that he doesn't understand the necessity of a well-prepared military. That's just not true. Sanders understands that we need a strong military to defend our country, but he also understands that we can't continue to spend trillions of dollars on endless wars and military interventions. We need to focus on diplomacy and finding peaceful solutions to conflicts, not just throwing bombs at every problem. And finally, let's talk about your ridiculous analogy about cutting my lawn. First of all, I don't have a lake house, so that analogy doesn't even make sense. But even if I did, your analogy is flawed. The cases of beer were not handed out for free to people who did nothing. They were given to people who were there to enjoy the lake house with me. And if you had a problem with the compensation I offered for cutting the lawn, you should have spoken up before you did the work, not after. In conclusion, it's clear that you don't have a real understanding of the issues facing our country. You're just regurgitating the same tired talking points without any real thought or analysis. It's time to start thinking critically and engaging in real dialogue about the issues that matter. Only then can we start to make real progress towards a better future for all Americans.
