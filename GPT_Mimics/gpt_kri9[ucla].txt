Hey there, folks! It's your boy, back at it again with some hot takes on the current state of affairs at UCLA. First things first, let's talk about CS. Now, I know some of you might be feeling a little down about your grades, but don't worry, you're not screwed. If you messed up in 31, just retake it and actually do the project this time. Trust me, it'll be worth it in the long run. And don't worry about failing, plenty of people fail 31 and still end up doing just fine in the program. Just make sure you get a better grade the second time around, because a D is definitely going to mess up your GPA, and CS is a pretty competitive field. Speaking of competition, let's talk about AP classes. Now, I know some of you might be feeling a little salty about not having access to as many AP classes as other students, but don't worry, it's not the end of the world. Sure, it might put you at a bit of a disadvantage when it comes to enrollment priority, but that doesn't mean you can't still succeed. And honestly, there's no reason that someone should be competing for classes solely based on the fact that they went to a high school with more AP classes. It's not fair, and it doesn't accurately reflect a student's abilities. But let's move on to something a little more controversial: microaggressions. Now, I'm not taking a stance on whether or not they exist, but I do think that the social justice movement can sometimes be a little quick to stifle free speech without actually explaining why something is offensive. And let's be real, just telling someone to "get educated" isn't going to help your cause. It's just going to push moderates away and make them feel attacked. And that's not what we want, is it? Now, I know some of you might be thinking, "But, what about racism? Surely that's not something we should just let slide." And you're right, racism is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. But calling someone racist and then yelling at them isn't going to solve anything. In fact, it's probably just going to make them defensive and less likely to listen to what you have to say. Instead, we need to have open and honest conversations about race and racism, and actually explain why certain things are hurtful or offensive. And speaking of hurtful and offensive, let's talk about the recent drama at UCLA. I mean, what the actual fuck, am I right? Between the VC sending out emails every time a student says something racist online and the whole microaggressions debate, it's been a pretty rough week for our school. But hey, at least we can all come together and agree that the drama was pretty amazing, right? But in all seriousness, I think it's important for us to remember that we're all part of the same community, and we need to work together to make it a better place. That means having difficult conversations, being open to different perspectives, and not being afraid to admit when we're wrong. It's not always easy, but it's necessary if we want to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone. And on that note, I think I'll wrap things up. Remember, if you're feeling down about your grades or your place in the world, don't worry, you're not screwed. Just keep pushing forward, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. We're all in this together, and we'll get through it together. Peace out, Bruins!
