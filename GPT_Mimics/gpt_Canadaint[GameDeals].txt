I recently purchased a game called Crawl on sale from nuvem. It's an early access game that has been out for a little while now, and I was able to get it for a really good price. However, I have some concerns about the game and whether or not it's worth the money. Firstly, I think that the developers should focus more on the single player campaign. This is what made people fall in love with the original game, and I think that it's important to keep that aspect of the game alive. While the game does have some pretty good AI, it's clear that it's meant to be played with others. There's much more strategy involved when you have human players, and I think that the game would benefit from having more of a focus on the single player campaign. That being said, I have had fun playing the game by myself. The AI is challenging on harder difficulties, and I find myself getting sucked into the game for hours at a time. However, there's something about the game that lacks any character or personality at all. It's hard to put my finger on exactly what it is, but I just don't feel as invested in the game as I do with other games. I know that the game is still in early access, so there's a chance that the story will be fleshed out more in the future. I'm hoping that this is the case, as I think that a good story can really add to the overall experience of a game. I'm also hoping that the developers will implement online multiplayer soon, as it's the number one request from players. While the local play with friends is fun, it's not always possible to get a group of people together to play. Despite my concerns, I do think that the game is worth the money. I bought it from nuvem at full price, and I still think that it was a good purchase. The game is well-built, and the soundtrack is fantastic. It's true that it's tough to learn, but once you get a feel for how long you should spend in each level, it becomes easier. Unlocking some of the artifacts also helps make the game easier, especially when you unlock the glass artifact. I've never bought a game from nuvem before, so I was a little worried about whether or not the steam key would work in the US. However, I had no issues with it, and the game downloaded and installed without any problems. As someone who rarely purchases games at full price, I think that the sale price of $8 is definitely worth it. I've had the game on my wish list for a little while, and this is the lowest that it has been discounted so far. I did see some reviews that said that the game isn't really fun without three or more people. While I can see why this might be the case, I think that the developers are planning on releasing three more expansions for free. They are doing a storyline for King Knight, Plague Knight, and Spectre Knight, and a multiplayer mode is also in the works. I think that these additions will add more value to the game and make it more enjoyable to play. Overall, I would definitely recommend Crawl to anyone who is looking for a fun, challenging game to play. While it does have some flaws, I think that the game is well worth the money, especially at the sale price of $8. The developers are actively working on improving the game, and I'm excited to see what they come up with in the future.
