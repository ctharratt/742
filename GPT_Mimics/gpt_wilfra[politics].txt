The GOP debate was a spectacle to behold. It was a mix of hilarious and cringe-worthy moments that left me both entertained and concerned for the future of our country. But one thing is for sure, it was a night that will go down in history. The highlight of the night for me was when Rubio called out Trump for repeating himself. It was a moment of pure comedic gold. Trump's response of "I don't repeat myself. I don't repeat myself" was just the icing on the cake. It's moments like these that make me wonder if this is all just a big joke. But then there were the serious moments, like when Trump was asked about his plan to build a wall on the Mexican border but not the Canadian border. The moderator's question was clearly an attempt to bait Trump into saying something racist, but it was a valid question nonetheless. Trump's response was lackluster and didn't really answer the question. It's moments like these that make me concerned for the future of our country. Then there was Ben Carson, who seemed to be just waiting for his turn to speak. Every time he was mentioned, he would perk up and start talking. It was almost as if he was just waiting for someone to acknowledge him. And when he did speak, it was usually something nonsensical or irrelevant. I couldn't help but think, "Did you hear the bell, Ben? Shut the fuck up." But it wasn't just the candidates who were entertaining. The moderators also had their moments. When Kasich was asked to "bash these guys," he refused and instead talked about his own views on the topic. It was a refreshing change from the usual mudslinging that goes on in these debates. And then there was the drinking game. Every time someone asked Trump to explain his plan, you had to take a shot. It was a game that was sure to get you drunk fast. But it was also a sad commentary on the state of our politics. When a candidate can't even explain his own plan, it's a sign that something is seriously wrong. But amidst all the chaos and entertainment, there were some serious issues being discussed. One of the most contentious topics was civil rights. Rubio and Trump both accused each other of not supporting civil rights, while Cruz accused Trump of not doing enough for Israel. It was a heated debate that showed just how divided our country is on these issues. But what struck me the most was when Bernie Sanders was brought up. The moderators asked why he was so popular among young people, and one of the candidates responded by saying that he had done decades of civil rights work. This interested me, so I looked it up. What I found was that while Sanders had been a vocal supporter of civil rights, he had not actually done any work in that field. He had simply claimed to have been "standing up for" civil rights for decades. It was a disappointing revelation, but it didn't change my opinion of Sanders. Overall, the GOP debate was a mix of entertainment and serious issues. It was a night that will go down in history, for better or for worse. But one thing is for sure, it was a night that showed just how divided our country is on these issues. And that's something that we need to address if we want to move forward as a nation.
