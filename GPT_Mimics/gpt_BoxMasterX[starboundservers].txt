Dear all, I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that there will be some scheduled maintenance on our servers tonight at 8pm PST. We are setting up a dedicated PC for all hosting to ensure that performance issues will not be affected by anything other than the servers themselves. We expect to be done in a few hours and should be back up around 11pm PST. We will keep you updated on any changes. In other news, we now have a Facebook page up and running! Calmist brought to my attention that the player limit was only 8, so I have adjusted it to 50 for now. If anyone has used or wants to make a free account over at www.plex.tv, I am sharing my media server as well. The server has been updated and has been great so far! Everyone loves it! It is hosted on FIOS with an SSD, and the community is awesome. Plus, we have Teamspeak 3 up! My server is dedicated to keeping out griefers and trolls. As soon as anyone is caught or reported, I can ban their IP address. Feel free to join as my server has almost 0 downtime. Just opening the port on your router should do the trick. I am hosting my server on Windows 8.1 with no issues, so feel free to join my server and bring everyone along! Update: We are back up and operational! However, server downtime will be extended until 01/21 for 2 days. The weight of my CPU cooler is causing it to warp, so I ordered a new cooler, and it will be here on the 21st. Bear with me, and I will be back up shortly. Unfortunately, the server was down for a bit this morning. I had to reseat the heatsink on my CPU, and my 3tb external holding all of the movies has bad sectors. It's working for now, but I will want to get a replacement drive for the movies as well as the TV shows since there is now only 30gb of free space for TV shows and a replacement cooler for my CPU. Someone has offered donations, which is a great idea since that can only better the server for everyone. If anyone would like to donate to the server upgrades, you can send to my PayPal at alex.debia@gmail.com. Thanks in advance, guys, and I am glad everyone can enjoy not only the movies and TV shows but the game servers I am hosting as well. If anyone here on Reddit would like an invitation to my Plex media server, here are the instructions: If you do not have an account already, go to the site and make one. It is free! When you have your account, send me the email address you signed up with, and I can share my Library with you, all my movies and TV shows! FREE! The quality is also amazing. Sorry for the inconvenience, guys. I had to reinstall Starbound on a new drive, and the saved files were lost, so the planets may have been wiped. However, your inventory and ships should be intact. Keep in mind the next update will be wiping all data, including your character and ships. The next update will be here within a week! From the Starbound site: Heya! Long time no front page post. After taking it easy over the holidays, we jumped straight into preparing the next patch. The reason it’s taking awhile? Bug fixes. Bug fixes everywhere. They can be a little slow-going and unpredictable, but I think you guys will find the improvements worth the wait! We’re still working on a few things, so you can expect the patch in about a week’s time. Not all patches are going to take this long, of course. :) Fixes: - .ds_store issue affecting OSX 9.1 users (A bug where Finder created an invisible file called .ds_store in the player folder which caused the game to crash). - A number of character creation/selection screen crashes related to loading corrupted save files - An issue that could prevent the launcher from starting (MSVCRT.dll) - DirectX crash bug (303 bug) - Several memory leaks, including the slow-but-significant server memory leak a lot of people were experiencing and GUI memory leak - Fixed a crash bug related to GUI controls - Reduced memory load of FTL animation - .abc files with comments no longer crash the game, plus various .abc fixes as far as key signatures/timing - A number of issues with players spawning underground - A bug where players spawned outside the ship if they’d previously saved the game while in the Captain’s Chair - Right shift key was not working as a shift key, now it is - An issue tech slots were unusable under certain conditions - Wiring system fixes– wires are rendered below UI elements, wires no longer break when crossed into an unloaded sector - Added image metadata caching, improved assets caching - Added a jeep mech that was supposed to have been in the last patch, but had mysteriously gone missing! - Object flipping issues - Sped up the crafting window - Fixed a sound issue that occurred after many concurrent weapon hits - Characters no longer blink while sleeping in beds - Assorted minor performance improvements Additions: - New game modes! Permadeath and drop-everything-on-death modes. - Revolvers, pulse rifles, hand grenades, shivs, Floran needlers, Floran thorn hammer - Human guards now wear soldier uniforms - More decorative hats! Yay, hats! - More random encounters - Possibly more content, if it’s finished on time! Of course, there’s also the highly anticipated/possibly feared final character wipe– this patch contains a fix for save files so after this, you won’t need to worry about our patches destroying your characters or ships. This patch will wipe everything– characters, ships, and worlds. It will definitely be the last time we’ll need to wipe characters or ships and will hopefully be the last time we’ll need to wipe worlds. Almost on the first page for the server list! Not sure when the next update is, does anyone else know when the next update is supposed to come out? Nice! I still want to have a bunch of people find 1 of every Instrument and all play the same song together XD Not a problem at all. I really enjoy how the server is becoming a community. I will be logging in as well as soon as the next update comes through. This issue seems to happen with everyone, even me at home. Most likely, it's an issue with the game itself. It will only crash if playing certain songs on certain instruments. The server was shut down, but I have restarted it now. All should be well. My internet is having issues at home. Rebooting modem now to see if that helps, but it seems to be a Verizon issue in my area. I will update as soon as I know anything. I have updated the info @ If you guys don't mind upvote the server at the link. Hmm, the server is up with about 8 people connected. Maybe your firewall is blocking the connection? Try disabling your firewall and then connect. Thank you for your understanding and support. Best regards.
