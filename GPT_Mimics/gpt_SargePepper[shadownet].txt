OOC: Alright, let's get this conversation going. I'm not one for rolling, I prefer to role-play. It's all about the story, not just the mechanics. But let's talk about something important here. How many people have we killed on runs? Other runners, guards, spec ops, mercenaries? It's a lot. And there are people out there who will take the challenge of killing you or your loved ones for a price. It's always better to keep your weaknesses close to your chest. This board is backed up, so all it takes is one Wiley runner to look up this thread and boom, instant weak point. Watch your back and never reveal your weaknesses. That's free advice from a predator. And speaking of predators, I never thought I'd see Muchacho Bonito posting about their runs. For shame, amigo. You gotta keep your cards close to your chest. It's all about the game, and the game is survival. But let's talk about something else. I'm looking for a leather-bound copy of "The Illiad." None of that electronic crap, I want to feel the texture of the paper. E-books lose something in the translation. And while we're on the topic of books, has anyone read "The Trojan War"? It's a widespread Greek myth about Achilles and his all-powerful nature belayed by his arrogance. His power of battle and super strength was given to him by the gods, but his pride helped the Trojans defeat him in the form of a single weakness in his heel. It's quite the journey. And let's not forget about the importance of connections in this game. I'd love to develop my connection with the Seducer more, get more teaching on the way to talk my way through instead of beating my way through situations. And eventually, I'd love to get a Weapon Foci 3 on my bat. I can get in close with a mafia contact, or get more acquainted with the Duncan Holtz in the Gidget, since I got a VIP room with the place for taking out a Banshee with my bare hands. And speaking of that Banshee, I'd love to get the fangs turned into some kind of foci, something amplifying my social skills. But let's not forget about Dash. I'd love to see her in action, really putting her focus on running and dodging to the forefront. Maybe a run where she has to chase down another runner through some highway and an office building, really fast-paced action. And if CelticVengance is still around, I'd love to continue the drug lord plot that he started. And let's not forget about the promised Grindhouse Kung-Fu run, where Dash and a few other melee-oriented runners would fight ninjas and shit. Confined spaces, rushing along at high speeds, high possibility of danger? That's how you charm a lady. But let's not forget about the importance of keeping your weaknesses close to your chest. There are always people out there who will take the nuyen because it is offered. And while I'm not saying I will, someone like OP is an easy target. But a price tag up, there will be someone willing to take it. It's all about survival in this game, and you gotta do what you gotta do to stay alive. And let's not forget about the importance of owning, not leasing. I'll see what they have at the bookstore, but I'm more of an owner than a leasee. And let's not forget about the importance of overwhelming your enemies. Leave no question that they can never return the favor, regardless of whether they die in the attempt or not. There is always someone better than you at what you do. Half of what we do is convincing people that we are that person. Never reveal your weaknesses. Otherwise, the predators will come out. And let's not forget about the importance of a good cup of coffee. K-Nine, I had better have a fucking coffee waiting for me when I get there. And let's not forget about the importance of a good hot chocolate. Dash tops hers with an extra lump of whipped cream and pours a healthy dose of whipped vodka into the mix. That's how you do it. But let's not forget about the importance of staying on top of things. I never got the notification to play, or else I would have been there. It's all about communication, people. And let's not forget about the importance of a good cigar. Slowly burning down to its last nub, I let out a deep breath. The traffic of Seattle slowed down with the inevitable nightfall, and the warmth of the woman next to me rumbled with a well-satisfied sigh. A small trilling noise broke my peaceful gaze, and a small snarl escaped my lips as I noticed who it was. K-Nine. This better be good. That's all for now, folks. Stay safe out there.
