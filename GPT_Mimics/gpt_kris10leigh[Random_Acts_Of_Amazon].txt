Ahoy there mateys! It be me, yer friendly neighborhood pirate, and I be here to talk about the joys of gift giving. Ye see, I be a firm believer in the power of a well-chosen gift to brighten someone's day and bring a smile to their face. And let me tell ye, I've been on the receiving end of some truly wonderful gifts lately! First off, me hearties, let me give a shoutout to me good mate /u/rosebert and me son, the one and only Biebs. These two scallywags have some mighty fine taste in light pop music, and I be grateful for the tunes they've been sharing with me. It's been a great day all around, me buckos - me cap'n at work be pleased with me, I've got some jolly projects lined up and they're progressing well, and to top it all off, me mate /u/mynthe gifted me some treasures this morning! Arr, it's a good day to be a pirate! But that's not all, me hearties. I've also received some truly wonderful gifts from some of me fellow swashbucklers. Take, for example, the incense that /u/rosebert sent me. Now, I've never burned incense before, but I've always loved the smell of wood fires, and I hear that this stuff is wonderful. And talk about good timing - I just killed the giant scented candle that me mum gave me for Christmas, and was wondering what nice smelling thing I would acquire next. Thanks, /u/rosebert - ye've made me day! And then there's the tape dispenser that /u/mynthe sent me. Now, I know what ye be thinking - a tape dispenser? What kind of gift is that? But let me tell ye, me hearties, this be no ordinary tape dispenser. Ye see, I joined Paperback Swap a few weeks ago to work on moving the books I don't love and want to keep forever on to new homes (and get some other books I do want in the bargain), but ye haven't known pain/minor irritation until you've wrapped 9 books in paper and packing tape while having to cut every piece of tape by hand with scissors. It's a real pain in the aft deck, let me tell ye. But thanks to /u/mynthe, I no longer have to suffer through that particular form of torture. Arr, I be genuinely super pumped about this gift! Now, me hearties, I do have a bit of a bone to pick with some of ye. Ye see, just because ye have me email address doesn't mean ye can send me literally every question or problem ye have! It's not actually me job to bend over backwards to help ye, especially when ye're working on projects that aren't even RELATED to what I do. And 99.9999% of the time, I'm just going to forward yer message to the support@ alias ye're too good to email yourself. So kudos on costing yourselves an hour or two of yer problem sitting in me inbox instead of getting looked at by the people who can fix it! I feel like this is one of those shitty "life hacks" that maybe used to work and possibly does work when you're dealing with a small group - knowing someone you can ping directly instead of sending your messages to a general inbox could be really helpful in those cases! But in a bigger company where yer contact might not actually touch or have any insight into many areas and departments? Yeah bro, just follow the process ye were given. (Especially since our support team is awesome, quick, and super helpful - and they're like that for everyone, not just people whose messages get forwarded along by lowly me.) But enough about that, me hearties - let's talk about something more fun. Specifically, let's talk about sports fandom. Now, I've seen some pretty crazy stuff in me time as a pirate, but team-themed weddings and sports team coffin embellishments and urns? That's a whole new level of dedication. I don't even think a lot of these folks think of it as a fandom - it's a way of life. And ye know what? I can respect that. We all need something to be passionate about, and if sports is yer thing, then more power to ye. Speaking of things that are crazy, let me tell ye about the time I lived in Spokane. Now, I don't want to badmouth the place too much - there are some good folks there, and some nice things to see and do. But overall, it's a pretty depressing place. The roads are terrible, there's a really big homeless population (and yet it gets super cold during the winter), most of the people who work in Spokane actually live across the border in Idaho to dodge property taxes so there's no money...ye get the idea. Suffice it to say, I wasn't sad to leave it behind. But enough about depressing places - let's talk about something that really got me blood boiling today. I was on the bus with me dog, minding me own business, when some serial killer in the making picked up a woman's cloth puppy carrier and punted it down the aisle before calmly walking off the bus! He was a well-dressed guy, not anyone who looked drunk/high/whatever. The puppy was screaming, the woman was screaming, me dog was shaking like a leaf - it was super upsetting and scary! I had to hold me dog in me arms for the rest of the trip, he just couldn't stop trembling and doing little comfort barks at the puppy. Puppy is fine I think, woman (and the bus driver) is filing a police report...but of course now I have to worry about somebody curbstomping me dog on the bus along with all the other stuff I watch out for already! Blagh. I hope they catch him! And speaking of things that make me blood boil, let's talk about people who expect everyone around them to shell out hundreds of dollars just to attend their party. Now, I know that some of me friends are coworkers and we do work in an up-and-coming industry where we're all making more money than a lot of people our age. But ye never know what someone's expenses are like! Student loans, medical debt...one of me coworkers sends a large amount of his salary to his mom, who is disabled, so even though he probably makes about the same salary as everyone else he has dramatically less to actually take home and use on himself! I hate it when people just assume what others can "afford" and put it on the people who can't afford it, actually, to shame themselves by speaking up - it's a much better idea to have the host/planner suggest a budget beforehand and verify that it's okay with everyone before making definitive plans. And speaking of things that make me blood boil even more, let's talk about dating. Specifically, let's talk about the two-date fatigue. Ye know what I'm talking about, me hearties - that feeling ye get when ye go out with someone a couple of times and then just...lose interest. It's frustrating, because ye want to find someone to share yer life with, but it's hard to keep putting yerself out there when ye keep hitting that wall. But ye know what? I'm not giving up. I'll keep swiping right, keep going on dates, keep putting meself out there. Because ye never know when ye might find that special someone. And on that note, me hearties, I think I'll wrap things up for now. But before I go, let me just say this - gift giving is a wonderful thing, and it's something that we should all do more often. Whether it's a small token of appreciation or a grand gesture of love, a well-chosen gift can make all the difference in someone's day. So go out there, me hearties, and spread some joy! Arr!
