What could you possibly say negative about someone who goes alone? I mean, seriously, what's wrong with enjoying your own company and doing things on your own? It's not like you're hurting anyone or causing any trouble. In fact, going alone can be quite liberating and empowering. You don't have to worry about anyone else's schedule or preferences, you can just do what you want, when you want. And when it comes to going to the movies alone, it's even better. You can sit wherever you want, you don't have to share your popcorn, and you can fully immerse yourself in the movie without any distractions or interruptions. Now, I know some people might argue that going alone is sad or lonely, but I think that's a narrow-minded and judgmental view. Just because someone is alone doesn't mean they're lonely or unhappy. In fact, many people choose to go alone because they enjoy their own company and don't feel the need to constantly be surrounded by others. And even if someone is feeling lonely, going to the movies alone can be a great way to escape and find some solace in the darkness of the theater. But of course, there are always those who will judge and criticize others for doing things differently than they do. They might say that going alone is weird or anti-social, or that it's a sign of some deeper problem. But I think that's just their own insecurities and biases talking. They can't imagine enjoying something without someone else there to share it with, so they assume that anyone who does must be unhappy or abnormal. And let's not forget the other benefits of going alone. You can save money by not having to buy multiple tickets or snacks, you can avoid the hassle of coordinating with others, and you can even use the time to reflect and recharge. Going alone can be a form of self-care, a way to prioritize your own needs and desires. So, to all the solo adventurers out there, I say keep doing what you're doing. Don't let anyone else's judgments or opinions hold you back from enjoying life on your own terms. And to those who would judge or criticize, I say take a step back and examine your own biases and assumptions. Just because someone does things differently than you doesn't mean they're wrong or unhappy. We all have our own paths to follow, and sometimes that path leads us to the movies alone. Now, on a completely different note, let's talk about the Miles Davis biopic that's been in the works for years. I mean, what's the holdup? Miles Davis is one of the most influential and iconic musicians of the 20th century, and yet we still don't have a definitive film about his life and legacy. It's a travesty, really. I've heard rumors that the film has been struggling to secure financing because some people don't think there's enough interest in Miles Davis or his music. But that's just ridiculous. Miles Davis is a legend, and his music has influenced countless artists and genres. There's no doubt that there's a huge audience for a film about his life. And let's not forget the importance of representation in film. We need more stories about black artists and musicians, especially those who have had such a profound impact on our culture. It's not enough to just focus on the same old stories and perspectives. We need to broaden our horizons and explore the rich diversity of human experience. Now, I know some people might argue that Miles Davis isn't a big enough draw to justify a big-budget biopic. But I think that's just short-sighted thinking. There are plenty of successful films that focus on lesser-known or niche subjects. It's all about how you market and promote the film. If you can tap into the passion and enthusiasm of Miles Davis fans, you can create a buzz and generate interest. And let's not forget the importance of having a talented and respected director at the helm. I've heard rumors that some people are questioning whether or not the director of the Miles Davis biopic, who happens to be black, is "premier" enough to handle such a high-profile project. But that's just ridiculous. There are plenty of black directors who are just as talented and accomplished as their white counterparts. We need to stop perpetuating the myth that only white men can be "premier" directors. In fact, I would argue that the Miles Davis biopic needs a director who truly understands and appreciates his music and his legacy. Someone who can bring a fresh perspective and a deep respect for the subject matter. And if that happens to be a black director, all the better. So, in conclusion, we need to stop judging and criticizing people for going to the movies alone, and we need to start supporting and promoting films that explore the rich diversity of human experience, including the life and legacy of Miles Davis. Let's embrace our differences and celebrate the things that make us unique. And let's never forget the power of art and music to bring us together and inspire us to greatness.
