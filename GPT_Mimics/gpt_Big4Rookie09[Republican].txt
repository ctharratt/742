As someone who considers themselves a conservative, I often find myself at odds with the liberal agenda. However, I firmly believe that being for helping the poor does not automatically make one a liberal. It is possible to hold conservative values and still have a heart for those in need. One candidate who embodies this balance is John Kasich. I agree with the statement that he needs to stick it out until after Super Tuesday when the schedule gets more favorable to his folksy nature and moderate politics. Kasich's approach to governance is one that is grounded in compassion and practicality. He understands that the government has a role to play in helping those who are struggling, but also recognizes the importance of fiscal responsibility. One of the keys to Kasich's success will be the continued presence of both Trump and Cruz in the race. These two candidates split the anti-establishment vote, just as Kasich, Rubio, and Bush are splitting the establishment vote. If Kasich can continue to gain momentum and consolidate the moderate vote, he has a real chance of securing the nomination. Some may argue that helping the poor only serves to keep them dependent on the federal government. However, I believe that this is a shortsighted view. The reality is that many people are struggling to make ends meet, and without assistance, they would be unable to survive. It is not a matter of laziness or lack of ambition, but rather a systemic issue that requires a compassionate response. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that a callous indifference towards the plight of the mentally ill, drug addicted, and working poor is not a winning strategy. If we want to win elections and make a positive impact on people's lives, we must approach these issues with empathy and understanding. The recent Republican debate was a prime example of how not to conduct a political discourse. While it may have been entertaining for some, the reality is that it did little to inform voters about the candidates' policies and character. Instead, it devolved into name-calling and personal attacks. Ronald Reagan is often held up as the gold standard of conservative leadership. However, it is important to remember that ethics and compassion are timeless values that transcend political affiliations. Kasich embodies these values in his record of balancing both the federal and state budgets, while also expanding Medicaid to help those in need. It is also worth noting that polls can be misleading and incomplete. Kasich has finished higher in a primary than either Bush or Rubio, yet he was not included in some pre-primary polling data. We must look beyond the numbers and consider a candidate's record and experience. One issue that is particularly close to my heart is the treatment of the mentally ill. It is unacceptable that so many people are left to suffer on the streets or are sent to jail for minor offenses. We must do more to provide them with the care and support they need. In my perfect world, people with mental illness would be given a fair hearing before a judge who would take into account their medical records and testimony from doctors. They would then be institutionalized in a mental hospital rather than sent to prison. This would not only be more humane, but it would also save taxpayers money in the long run. Michael Bloomberg has recently been floated as a potential third-party candidate. While I am not necessarily a fan of his policies, I do believe that he would appeal to a wide range of voters. He is a centrist who could pull support from both sides of the aisle, and his record as a successful businessman could appeal to those who are looking for a pragmatic approach to governance. Ultimately, the key to winning elections and making a positive impact on people's lives is to approach politics with empathy and understanding. We must recognize that there are real issues facing our country, and that the solutions are not always simple or easy. However, by working together and approaching these issues with a compassionate heart, we can make a real difference in the lives of those who are struggling.
