Well, let's talk about the FBI and Apple case. It was a huge controversy that happened a few years ago. The FBI wanted access to the shooter's Apple device, but Apple refused to allow it. The reason behind this was that if the FBI tried to access the phone, it would have self-destructed the contents on it. So, the FBI took Apple to court for access to the phone, and the court ruled in favor of the FBI. Now, the question arises, why was Apple being a "bitch" about it? Well, there could be several reasons behind it. One of the reasons could be that Apple wanted to sell the FBI some overpriced software that would have done the job. However, the FBI refused to buy it, and that's why Apple was not willing to cooperate. Another reason could be that Apple was concerned about the privacy of its users. If Apple had allowed the FBI to access the shooter's phone, it would have set a dangerous precedent. It would have meant that the government could access anyone's phone without their consent, which would have been a violation of privacy. Now, let's talk about the difference between drywall and blue board. Drywall is hung, and the screw holes and seams are plastered. On the other hand, blue board is hung, and then the entire wall is plastered with one or two thin coats. This process requires a lot more patience and skill than drywall. The finish of blue board is more resilient and consistent than drywall, but it comes at a higher labor cost. So, if you want a finish with a bunch of seams, then drywall is the way to go. However, if you want a more durable and consistent finish, then blue board is the better option. Now, let's talk about the expansion of companies. When companies expand, they spend their profits on expansion, leaving no profit but spending all that money on their own investment. This is perfect for a corporation because it allows them to grow and become more profitable in the long run. However, this can also be a risky strategy because if the expansion fails, then the company could end up losing a lot of money. So, companies need to be careful when they decide to expand and make sure that they have a solid plan in place. Now, let's talk about the prohibition of eating pork in Islam and Christianity. In Islam, Allah Almighty prohibits His servants from eating swine. The Qu'ran says, "Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been invoked a name other than that of Allah.” (Al-Ma’idah: 3). Similarly, in Christianity, the Bible says, “…and the swine, as he divideth the hoof, and be cloven footed, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you. Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcass shall ye not touch, they are unclean to you.” (Leviticus chapter 11 verse 7 and 8). So, both religions prohibit the consumption of pork. The reason behind this could be that pigs eat anything, and they could ingest bacteria that could harm humans. With that, they could also ingest something that is unhealthy and, in turn, is "cleaning" the earth. So, it is viewed as more of a sacred animal. Now, let's talk about safehouses. Safehouses are used probably more by police than any group you mentioned. When I say police, I'm referring to CSIS, RCMP, FBI, CIA. It is seldom used on a local law enforcement level, but they are used globally. In fact, it was surveillance from a safehouse in Pakistan that led to the discovery and death of Osama bin Laden. A quick Google search will give you lots of results on the raid and a brief history of the safehouse itself. Now, let's talk about the search function on Reddit. I ran a few vague tests in askreddit and DIY, and it seemed to pull different threads from what the app found to what I found on a browser. I can only assume it is a 'Reddit is fun' bug at this point as I would consider the search function directly from the Reddit website to be more true as it pulled more relevant threads. If you are looking for other Reddit apps, I would recommend "BaconReader" and "Apollo." Both of these apps have a great user interface and are easy to use. In conclusion, we talked about several topics, including the FBI and Apple case, the difference between drywall and blue board, the expansion of companies, the prohibition of eating pork in Islam and Christianity, safehouses, and the search function on Reddit. Each of these topics is unique and interesting in its way, and I hope you learned something new today.
