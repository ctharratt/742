Yo, what's up guys? I just finished playing some Black Ops 3 and Battlefront and let me tell you, Treyarch never disappoints with COD. They always have the most content, solid maps, and deep customization and unlocks. It's always enjoyable and I've never gone wrong with them. I mean, sure there are click bait articles and pop up ads everywhere, but hey, everyone's gotta get paid somehow, right? I'm a big fan of third person action games, so I was pretty bummed when I missed out on The Last of Us and God of War 3 last gen. I mean, I had 1 and 2 on my PS2, so it was a real bummer. But I'm playing Until Dawn again now and man, knowing all the twists and turns later on just makes the beginning so much creepier. I'm picking up on small subtle little things that I missed the first time around. I really loved The Last of Us. Being a prior 360 owner, I was definitely jealous. Next up is God of War 3, my girlfriend already said she bought me that for Christmas. I noticed this annoying glitch where if you fast travel to the top of the mass fusion building and take the elevator all the way down, the gate won't open. If you take it back up, it'll load you into the side of the building and you're unable to fast travel. It's a crazy drop, but I shot up on med x to survive the fall.  I feel like these numbers will jump on Christmas. The Star Wars hype is real and a lot of kids probably asked their parents for the game and consoles to play it. I'll always love this series, but everything must come to an end. That may be true, but this is also a new pricing method. There was no season pass for Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas also did not have one, but received 4 DLC at $10 each. I'm gonna say we will get at least 3. Just because they priced the season pass at $30 doesn't mean there won't be additional content. I got stuck between a legendary death claw and a glowing one so far, at level 3... Thank you for auto saves from earlier. The game is a blast! Just remember like every Bethesda game, save often. Lol nah it's all good. Apparently it's a normal thing lol. My girlfriend did choir in school since 6th grade, she hates the sound of her voice also. Lol not at all, I particularly hate my own voice haha. I've seen several analysis and oddly enough, it's worse on Xbox One, including occasional freezes and stutters. All analysis I saw, the lowest the PS4 got was to 23. Still not ideal, however not enough to halt me from playing. From what I've seen, most of the time it's at 30. I also game on a shitty laptop, so I'm accustomed to bad framerate. Lol but I can understand some people's choice. My blood pressure will be happy it's gone, but I do miss the added challenges. I aimed more towards mechanics because it always surprised me how many people didn't know what any Fallout before 3 was like. I purposely avoided going too much into Fallout 4 because it's already been extensively covered by other sources and I usually avoid pre-release info as much as possible. I like going in as dark as I can, however the hype got me on Fallout. Thank you for the feedback, definitely will look into breaking it up a bit more next time. I'm just experimenting in general with scriptwriting and taking a course for it next semester. If you can get around the dated look, those games are insanely fun! I started with 3 and went back and played one and 2, then New Vegas. The only ones in here I didn't play are the spin off games, and didn't know about them till I started this project. I did some research and it said Darksiders 2 Deathinitive Edition was available both physically and digitally. Every retailer near me though did not have it, and it didn't show up as an item in their inventory online. I've heard solid framerate, slightly bumped up resolution, but it's exactly the same game. I'm fine with that, I missed it the first go and loved the original. I may just have to bite the bullet and go digital. I wanted something to hold me over until Fallout 4 and I loved the original Darksiders. Shipping would place it here the day before Fallout and that's not what I need lol. Thank you anyways! I had one or two spazzy animation glitches but no rubber banding. I'm sure it's tied to Internet connection. I rubber banded all the time in BF4 even after the major patches that fixed it for most players. Upgraded my connection and haven't had problems in any game. Thought it was a trailer for DLC or another game. Got super let down until I tried it. This is awesome! Check out communities and meet people to play with. A squad that communicates well can turn the entire battle easily. And the game is so much fun with a group of people. Also, invest in premium. So much extra great content and is consistently being added to. Last I checked, the daily player base was around 60k on PS4 so still very active also! I'm patiently awaiting Bloodborne DLC information. Excited for DS3, but I'm still in love with Yharnam. Why does it cost $10 more than the original release is what I want to know. So good. I noticed something odd later in the game, this video points it out. Obvious spoilers, but I've played through it so many times and I can't stop. Seriously. It's an amazing experience. Just took this screenshot. Wish I could make it the background on my PS4, it was easy enough to do so on my laptop... Seemed dependent on the game. Dead Space 3, for example, on all systems has this. Working on Destiny myself, can never get the clan-specific ones to pop, tried each one quite a few times. I just wanna play some of the traditional stuff like death match, but all I find are lobbies of custom made things like stuntman versus snipers and such. It's fun for a while, but I just wanna play some TDM damn it! I loved Wolfenstein: The New Order up until the final boss. It was kinda frustrating, but I loved the rest of the game. If you liked The New Order, this is more of that. Less protagonist focused, but some of the important Nazis you meet are really messed up and at the point you just want to exterminate them. How is NHL 15? I remember hearing some features were missing. Should I just wait till NHL 16? My dad recently got me into hockey (go Rangers!) and hoping we can connect over this during the off season and such. You can get through story mode and low difficulty towers by just memorizing a few special moves with each character, no crazy combos needed. Thank fully 90% of all special moves are two directional movements and one button press. (down back square for an example) and many characters use the same inputs for their specials. What this turns into is you can use just about any character and their special moves pretty easily. Also, if you enjoy it, stick around and try to learn it. It's a lot of fun and when you finally go from just pulling off a few specials and small 4 hit combos to doing the crazy juggle combos, you'll feel like a God. Also, learn to block. Blocking in MKX is so important to the outcome of a fight! I just got wired. Went from less than 1 up and down on wireless to 40 something. It's a game changer, guys. Seriously.
