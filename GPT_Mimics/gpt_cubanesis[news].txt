I completely agree with myself. Fair is fair and greedy is greedy, and $15 an hour for an entry-level job is just plain greedy. It's like saying that someone who puts stuff in a bag is doing the same level job as someone who has to actually think and use their brain. I mean, come on. Now, I'm not saying that $7.75 an hour is enough to live on. I barely get by on the $12.50 I make, so I can imagine the struggle. But at some point, people need to step up and make their situation better. When I was offered a job at $11 an hour, I told them I have to start at $12.50. The owner asked me if I was worth that, and of course, I said yes. I've been here for eight months now, and they are thrilled with my work. I've made myself irreplaceable. So when I have my yearly review in four months, I'm going to tell them what a person doing my job needs to be making, which is about $18 an hour. And I think I'll be able to walk out with $15 an hour easily. But the thing is, not everyone can do what I do. Some people are just bad employees. Lazy, dumb, rude, unreliable, etc. That's why they end up working at Walmart as a bag boy in their mid-30s. And even if Walmart started paying bag boys $20 an hour, I wouldn't do it. I have self-respect and wouldn't compromise the satisfaction I get from a challenging job well done. Being a bag boy, or stocker, or some other entry-level job would drive me nuts. And let's not forget that if Walmart or McDonald's started paying their employees $15 an hour minimum, their prices would have to go up. So while they are cashing $550 checks, I'm cashing $350 checks, but we both have to pay $4 for a cheeseburger that used to cost $1. It's just not sustainable. Now, I know some people are going to say that Walmart has as much money as a first-world country, so why shouldn't they pay their employees $15 an hour? But the thing is, I've never encountered a Walmart employee that deserves $15 an hour. They don't know where anything in the store is, they're typically rude, and it's hard to get basic communication out of them. Even the clerks don't talk to you sometimes, and I don't mean conversation, I mean things like telling you your total bill. The bottom line with this strike and the fast food workers too is that those jobs don't pay well because they're not jobs for people with families. These are entry-level positions, and entry-level jobs don't start at $15 an hour. And let's be real, if someone is an adult and can't excel past a job designed for a teenager, why do they deserve $15/hr? Why does someone who can't NOT put pickles on my burger deserve $15/hr? Just because you don't make enough to feed your family doesn't mean you're being slighted. I'm a high school graduate with no college or special tech school training, and I started as a grunt in a fish house making $7/hr when I was 15. By the time I was 20, I was the production manager for a major radio station. I got to that position by working hard, being friendly and reliable, and not expecting to get anything other than a fair wage. By 25 years old, I was making a little south of the $30k a year mark. That's $14 an hour. In what world is flipping a burger or pushing a button on a touch screen on the same level as writing and producing content for a media company? Now, I'm not saying that everyone can just work hard and get ahead. There are certainly systemic issues that make it harder for some people to succeed. But I do think that everyone should be held to a certain standard. If you can't do your job well, you don't deserve to be paid $15 an hour. And if you're not willing to put in the work to get a better job, then you don't deserve to be paid $15 an hour either. And let's not forget that there are plenty of other jobs out there that pay more than $15 an hour. I became a baker and then a web manager and graphic designer for a BMW dealership, and I'm making $12.50 an hour. These are skilled jobs that require hard work and dedication, and they pay more than entry-level jobs for a reason. So in conclusion, I stand by my original statement. Fair is fair and greedy is greedy, and $15 an hour for an entry-level job is just plain greedy. People need to step up and make their situation better, and if they can't do their job well, they don't deserve to be paid $15 an hour. It's as simple as that.
