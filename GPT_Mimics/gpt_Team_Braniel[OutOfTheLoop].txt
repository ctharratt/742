I've been on the internet for a long time, and I've seen a lot of changes happen. One of the biggest changes I've seen is the rise and fall of various social media websites. I remember when Digg was the king of the internet, and Reddit was just a small community of geeks and nerds. But then, something happened. Digg made a terrible mistake, and Reddit was there to pick up the pieces. It's hard to remember exactly when it happened, but I think it was around 2008 or 2009. Digg had just launched a new redesign, and it was terrible. They gave too much power to corporate posters and advertisers, and it ruined the site. Overnight, a large portion of Digg's users left the site for Reddit. It was a massive exodus, and it gave Reddit its mass appeal almost overnight. To be fair, Reddit was around before the exodus, and a lot of us used both sites. But Digg had a much larger community and a cleaner site, so most people socialized on Digg and lurked on Reddit. There was a kind of competition between the two, but when the redesign happened, there was no debate. Fuck Digg, we're all moving to Reddit. Reddit has had its own share of problems over the years, but it's managed to survive and thrive. One of the biggest problems Reddit has faced is the rise of toxic communities. There have been a lot of smaller sites over time that would get leeched by Reddit, or by Digg before Reddit. FunkyJunk, 9gag, ebaum's world, etc. But Reddit has managed to stay on top, despite the challenges. One of the things that has helped Reddit survive is its ability to adapt. Reddit has changed a lot over the years, and it's managed to stay relevant. It's gone from a small community of geeks and nerds to a mass public website. Reddit hitting mainstream notoriety opened the door for all kinds of garbage, but it's also allowed Reddit to grow and evolve. One of the biggest changes I've seen on Reddit is the rise of the hivemind. The hivemind is a term used to describe the collective consciousness of Reddit. It's the idea that Reddit users all think and act the same way. They upvote the same things, downvote the same things, and have the same opinions. It's a powerful force, and it's one of the things that makes Reddit so unique. But the hivemind can also be a dangerous thing. It can lead to groupthink, where people stop thinking for themselves and just follow the crowd. It can also lead to echo chambers, where people only hear opinions that they already agree with. And it can lead to toxic communities, where people are encouraged to hate and attack others. One of the biggest examples of the hivemind in action is the rise of the subreddit r/atheism. r/atheism was one of the biggest circlejerks I've seen on here. It got virulent, and then everyone got vocal about how much they hated them. Then it became a game of who hated r/atheism more, even on r/atheism people circlejerked about hating r/atheism. It was a colossal shit show. But yeah, I agree, it never should have been made a default. Reddit has also had its share of drama over the years. The transition from the 3rd to the 4th age started with the Boston Bomber drama, I would say. The transition period lasted until Pao's resignation when the drama started to settle down, but the site's whole feel and spirit has changed because of it. Voat kind of grew during this whole transition period because of the drama. But despite all the drama and the toxic communities, Reddit has managed to survive and thrive. It's become a place where people can come together to share ideas, opinions, and stories. It's a place where people can find like-minded individuals and connect with others who share their interests. One of the things that I love about Reddit is the sense of community. There are so many different subreddits out there, each with its own unique community. Whether you're into gaming, politics, or just want to share pictures of your cat, there's a subreddit for you. But Reddit is not without its problems. One of the biggest problems is the rise of astroturfing and shills. Astroturfing is the practice of creating fake grassroots movements to promote a product or idea. Shills are people who are paid to promote a product or idea. Both of these practices are unethical, and they can be very damaging to the integrity of Reddit. Another problem with Reddit is the rise of censorship. Reddit has been accused of censoring certain topics and opinions, and this has led to a lot of controversy. Some people believe that Reddit is trying to control the narrative and promote certain ideas, while others believe that Reddit is just trying to maintain a civil discourse. Despite these problems, I still believe that Reddit is one of the best social media websites out there. It's a place where people can come together to share ideas, opinions, and stories. It's a place where people can find like-minded individuals and connect with others who share their interests. And it's a place where people can learn and grow. In conclusion, Reddit has come a long way since its early days as a small community of geeks and nerds. It's become a mass public website, and it's faced a lot of challenges along the way. But despite the drama and the toxic communities, Reddit has managed to survive and thrive. It's become a place where people can come together to share ideas, opinions, and stories. And I believe that it will continue to be a great place for years to come.
