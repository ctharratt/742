The world of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) is a complex and ever-changing one. From the ranking system to the professional scene, there are always new developments and controversies to discuss. As a fan of the game, I have been following these discussions closely and have some thoughts to share. One topic that has been on my mind lately is the state of the ranking system. As someone who has been playing CSGO for a few years now, I have seen the system evolve and change over time. However, I have also noticed some issues with it that I think need to be addressed. Firstly, there seems to be a wide variation in skill levels within each rank. For example, someone who is a Legendary Eagle (LE) may not necessarily be better than someone who is a Master Guardian Elite (MGE). This can lead to frustration for players who feel like they are stuck in a certain rank, even though they may be better than some players in higher ranks. Additionally, I have noticed that raw aim seems to be more important than tactics and strategy in some matches. This should not be the case in higher ranks like LE, where players should be expected to have a good understanding of the game's mechanics and be able to execute complex strategies. However, I have seen matches where players rely solely on their aim to win, which can be frustrating for those who prefer a more tactical approach. Another issue with the ranking system is that it seems to be too easy to rank up or down. I have seen players go from LE to Supreme Master First Class (SMFC) in just a few matches, while others seem to be stuck in the same rank for months. This can lead to a lack of motivation for players who feel like their efforts are not being rewarded. One possible solution to these issues could be to adjust the ranking system so that lower ranks hold more players. This would help to even out the skill levels within each rank and make it more difficult to rank up or down. Additionally, Valve could consider implementing a system where players are rewarded for their tactical and strategic abilities, rather than just their aim. Another topic that has been on my mind lately is the issue of sexism and other forms of hate in the game. As a male player, I have not personally experienced this, but I have seen it happen to female players and it is unacceptable. Valve should take steps to address this issue, such as implementing a cooldown in matchmaking for players who engage in sexist or hateful behavior. However, I also think that female players should not be separated into their own leagues. While I understand the reasoning behind this, I believe that it is important for female players to compete against male players in order to improve their skills. As Warowl once said, "you can only get better by playing against better opponents." By competing against male players, female players will be able to improve their skills and become better players overall. Finally, I want to touch on the issue of professional casting and commentary. While I enjoy watching professional matches and listening to the commentary, I have noticed that some casters and commentators take things too seriously. This can lead to a lack of enjoyment for viewers who just want to watch a good match and have some fun. Additionally, I have seen some casters and commentators engage in unprofessional behavior, such as making personal attacks on other casters or players. This is unacceptable and should not be tolerated in the professional scene. In conclusion, the world of CSGO is a complex and ever-changing one. From the ranking system to the professional scene, there are always new developments and controversies to discuss. While there are certainly issues that need to be addressed, I believe that the game has a bright future ahead of it. As long as we continue to have open and honest discussions about these issues, we can work towards making CSGO a better and more enjoyable game for everyone.
