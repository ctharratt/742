So, I was scrolling through the front page and came across this post about a rock conveyor. And it got me thinking about Keith Richards. You know, the guy who's been purveying rock for decades. I mean, the man is practically a living legend. But I digress. The post itself was a little obtuse, but maybe that's just me. I mean, sometimes things can be a little too clever for their own good. But hey, I'll give it an upvote for the footnote. And speaking of footnotes, have you ever noticed how the furry green things always seem to be on the inside of your fridge? It's like they're hiding in there, waiting to pounce on your leftovers. But I digress again. The post got me thinking about brand advertising. You know, selling the dream instead of the reality. It's like those SUV commercials where they show the car driving through a river or something, but in reality, you're just picking up your kid from soccer practice. It's all about the image, not the actual use. But then I read another post about Bill Gates and how he's ridding the world of three diseases at the same time. And it made me realize that sometimes, just sometimes, brand advertising can actually do some good. It's all about the message, not the medium. Speaking of messages, I once had someone tell me that art didn't always have to mean something. Sometimes it was just about doing what could be done or making something nice to look at. And you know what? That kind of made sense to me. It stopped me from always trying to come up with some deep meaning behind every piece of art I saw and just appreciate it for what it was. But then again, sometimes something that looks bloody simple is actually really hard to make. And that's the art of it. It's like that crack fox. You know, the one that always says "hide your head and shoulders"? Maybe he's actually an orphan and this hits a little too close to home for him. And speaking of home, have you ever washed your towels in cold water and had them shrink? It's like, what's the point of even washing them if they're just going to get smaller? But I guess that's just the way it goes sometimes. But let's get back to that rock conveyor. I mean, it's a pretty impressive piece of machinery, isn't it? And it got me thinking about how technology is always advancing and how things are constantly being superseded. Like, why would anyone market something as the latest and greatest if they know it's just going to be outdated in a few years? I mean, I wonder if Keith Richards ever thought about that. Did he ever worry that his music would become outdated or irrelevant? Or did he just keep doing what he loved and let the rest take care of itself? And speaking of doing what you love, have you ever tried cooking with Asian greens and a twist of lime? It's delicious. And it just goes to show that sometimes the simplest things can be the most satisfying. But then again, sometimes things aren't so simple. Like that tortured green creature in the post. Maybe he's actually an orphan and this is hitting a little too close to home for him. Or maybe he's just a fictional character and I'm reading too much into it. Who knows? But one thing I do know is that Halloween in Australia is a bit of a non-event. I mean, sure, some people get into it, but for the most part, it's just another day. And that's okay. We don't need to celebrate every holiday that comes our way. Speaking of holidays, have you ever wondered if Will Smith will smith? I mean, he's a pretty talented guy. And if anyone could smith something, it's probably him. But then again, maybe he's not the only one who can smith. Maybe we all have a little bit of smithing in us. Maybe we just need to find our niche and let our talents shine. And speaking of talents, have you ever seen someone park a car and it takes them like 10 tries to get it right? It's like, come on, how hard can it be? But then again, maybe they're just not used to the car or the spot or whatever. We all have our off days. But let's get back to that rock conveyor. I mean, it's a pretty impressive piece of machinery, isn't it? And it just goes to show how far we've come as a society. We're constantly pushing the boundaries and exploring new frontiers. But then again, sometimes we need to take a step back and appreciate the simple things in life. Like a banana for scale or a massive trash bag. Or even just a good old-fashioned book from the library. Because at the end of the day, it's not about the latest and greatest or the most advanced technology. It's about the people and the experiences that make life worth living. And that's something we should never forget.
