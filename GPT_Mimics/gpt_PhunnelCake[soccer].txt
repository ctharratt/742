Wow, for all the criticism that Madrid receives for sometimes underperforming, all it takes is a moment or clip like this to remind you just how good they are when they click! The penalty call was a bit controversial, but Okazaki had to ask for it to be given. Sakho clearly tackled his foot, and it was a clear foul. I have a feeling that today is the day that Leicester drops points. Liverpool is able to spread them out and open them up. If Leicester got tighter and just tried to play counter-attack, in my opinion, they would have a better chance to win. It would explain his averting behavior every time the transfer window rolls around. Wait, really? Link, please. We need more articles like this on this sub! While soccer isn't as statistics-heavy and dependent as baseball, for example, the statistics still give you an insight into how things may have potentially gone wrong with clubs like Chelsea, for example. Also, one can only see so many of the same jokes before they get boring. They have like every flare imaginable. Ronaldo is not going anywhere. People usually downvote comments like this, but I love the raw emotion of disgruntled fans, especially on Reddit. This is something I would expect on YouTube or IG, not on Reddit, lol. Manchester City, in my opinion, is one long-term manager and a few transfers away from being the top club in England. Unpopular opinion, I know, but their youth academy is just pumping out amazing youth players, and they are financially stable and rich, and have the allure of being in the prem to draw any players they desire. All that Pepsi finally got to him. Pep was right! Vardy successfully diminishing Chelsea's chance of a win. From a neutral perspective, Leicester is hard to hate. Their play so far this game has been very appealing! That's not true! You can switch nationalities. I think you need citizenship or a visa (not sure about the eligibility requirements), but for sure, you can switch nationalities, ex. Diego Costa. I think if you make an appearance in the senior team, you cannot switch nationalities, iirc, but up until that point, it's fair game, as long as you are eligible for the national team. That's why John Brooks can play for the U.S. or how Lewa could've played for Germany. Yeah, you're right. But it worked for Origi! That should at least make you optimistic, since Origi was in the worst XI for Ligue 1 last season, and now he's doing great. I think it's funny/cool to see that Belarabi and Chicha are friends now, considering they were at each other's throats a few days ago! What are the realistic chances that Leicester can get a European spot this season? Or that they get a top 4 spot even? The irony. If this is intentional, this is the best nutmeg I've seen in a while. Hey! I went to high school with him. Honest question: Why not bring in one midfielder next month? Especially given how injury-prone Arsenal is, and coupling that with Cazorla just being out of form as of late, what's the problem and reluctance with bringing in someone half-decent? Even something like a loan. I totally understand what you mean, though. It makes the game a bit unrealistic too, you could say in a sense. I imagine going to a brothel is not worse than going on a racist drunken tirade. I always thought that was the "damn, that was too hot! it burned" celebration... To be fair, though, Brazil does have a thriving Asian population. I feel like a lot of people involved in professional soccer probably lurk on /r/soccer from time to time, to be honest. I don't have any proof, but it can't be THAT far-fetched. Still better than his 17 teammates that also played. I'm pretty sure I found Danny Welbeck's personal Instagram once. He didn't accept my follow request :( and it was on private. "And the finish from Neymar is as cool as a bomb disposal expert" LOL. Sometimes RM confuses me with line-ups. Like when they brought in Lucas Silva last season and put him straight into the starting 11? If you want to know more about what I'm getting at, read "The Decline of Guilt" by Herbert Morris. No, because they're not polar opposites like hot and cold. Guilt implies that one can understand the implications of one's actions and the repercussions/externalities of them as well. That's the reason why under Common Law, kids under the age of 7 cannot be held accountable for their actions. Oh, got it. I've felt a similar way as you describe, sometimes I make comments on here that I think make sense and are backed by logic, but they get downvoted without much justification. I'd like to think he made and uses an alt account now to lurk and occasionally comment here, tbh. What ever happened to him? Does Bellerin have a British accent? Yeah, but that took a certain US president to declare "Ich bin ein Berliner." I don't see Trump, Hillary, or Sanders doing that anytime soon. 137 dead in Nigeria if I'm not mistaken as well. Edit: today. Yeah, Villa won it actually. Icardi will be their poster boy. I don't get it. What's sexual about their logo? I understand Roma. That's career-ruining level, man, not to mention the money in soccer. It's the same concept with property law, funnily enough. The government/agencies responsible for testing can't say what is a reasonable amount to take, so it's easier to set strict rules and a blanket ban. Similarly, in property law, the government sets strict liability rules because it is impossible to determine how it will affect everyone. Just because someone currently playing hasn't come out and said that "Hey guys, we take PED's!" doesn't mean it's any less true. Being ignorant of the fact doesn't make it any less possible or true. The best example is Fuentes and his list that was ordered to be destroyed. You don't think that there were some big soccer names on there? Also, look at Xavi or Iniesta or even Messi. Besides talent, do they look like they should be physically able to put up 60 plus games a season? I think your argument is invalid and ignorant. Also, MANY former players have come out to admit that they had doped, and many others had doped. Do you think that it just magically stopped? LOL. Would you like me to use Google for you and find cases? No, because the judge ordered all the blood bags and the list of clients to be destroyed. Otherwise, I'm pretty sure some big names in Spain would be on there. Also, look at Xavi. Does he look like he should be able to play 60 games a season? It's because people are ignorant of the fact that it's unfair to those trying to break into the sport and the teams that can't afford PED's. Barcelona is probably doping up its players? Same with Real Madrid? (Would you really put it past Perez?) Nah, you're just crazy. Ironically, I think your comment is ignorant of the fact that athletes are still people too. I think this one is more blind luck, Williams seems more like he meant it. They weren't just random kids; they were talented enough starting at a young age to stand out compared to others their age. At Barcelona, if he keeps trying it and failing, he'll be benched.
