Hey there, folks! I'm here, ready to talk about the latest and greatest in smartphone technology. Today, I want to dive into the world of the Moto X Pure and share my thoughts on this device. First things first, let's talk about the battery. It's a vast improvement over the 2014 X, no doubt about it. But, there's no OIS, which is a bit strange considering the Nexus 6 has it. However, the shutter is lightning fast, so the lack of OIS isn't a deal-breaker. Overall, I'm pretty impressed with the battery life. I also have the Note 5, and while the Pure doesn't quite match up in terms of battery life, it still holds its own. Plus, having the convenience of SD support is a huge plus. Speaking of battery life, let's talk about Turbo Charging. Motorola was really pushing this feature, and it's apparent why once you start using the phone. While the battery isn't terrible, it's not great either. You can almost watch the battery meter go down while using the phone. Turbo Charging definitely helps, but if you're going to be away from a charger for a while, you might have some concerns. Now, let's talk about Motorola's customer service. I've had a bit of a nightmare experience with them, to be honest. My launch day order was lost in the process, and their customer service has been abysmal. They're insanely slow to credit you back after canceling an order, and I just can't reward them with my business until they get their act together on support. Moving on to storage, the 16GB base model is just ridiculous in 2015. I mean, come on, Motorola! I'm using a Pure that I picked up at Best Buy just to test for a week or so, and even with my normal apps and icon packs (I don't keep music on my phone), I woke up this morning to find that a bunch of my apps failed to auto-update overnight because I suddenly had less than 1GB of storage left. It's ridiculous to advertise a phone as being 16GB and only getting less than 10GB out of the box. And don't even get me started on the bloatware. I can't figure out why it's so bloated now. I would advise spending the extra $50 and getting at least 32GB. The 16GB has 9.50GB available out of the box, which is just not enough. Now, let's talk about the ordering process. I know a lot of people are in order waiting hell, and I feel for you. I ordered on September 2nd at 2:25pm and still haven't received my phone. It's been a nightmare dealing with customer service, but I've found that calling and speaking to the "Order Administration department" is the best way to get things done. Don't take no for an answer, and don't let them tell you that it will "mass ship" on a certain date. Get mad, but don't be out of control. Speak in a stern, strong way and let them know you're fed up and done with the process. Cancel the order if you have to, but don't get off the phone until they do it. One thing I do like about the Moto X Pure is the 2.5D screen. It's a bit of a pain to find screen protectors that fit correctly, but once they do, it's a great feature. Glass screen protectors are a bit tricky, but plastic ones work just fine. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the Moto X Pure. It's fast, fluid, and the camera is solid (even without OIS). The convenience of SD support is a huge plus, and the Turbo Charging definitely helps with battery life. However, the lack of storage and bloatware are major downsides, and Motorola's customer service leaves a lot to be desired. Well, that's all for now, folks. Thanks for tuning in to my ramblings on the Moto X Pure. Until next time, happy smartphone shopping!
