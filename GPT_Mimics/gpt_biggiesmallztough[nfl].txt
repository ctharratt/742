Well, let me tell you, the Redskins are on fire right now. I mean, have you seen them play? They're dominating both sides of the ball and making plays left and right. It's like they're a completely different team from last year. And let's talk about Matt Jones and Alfred Morris. These guys are a dynamic duo in the backfield. They're running all over defenses and making it look easy. I mean, they combined for 150 yards in the last game alone. That's insane. But of course, there's always a downside. Cousins started the second half with a pick 6. I mean, come on man, you can't be doing that. But the Giants didn't let up, they went for an offside kick and it worked. And then DHall got baited on a play action and OBJ got a 50 yard TD catch. It was a rough start to the second half, but the Redskins pulled it together. And let's not forget about the defense. They had 3 interceptions and 2 forced fumbles in the first half alone. That's some serious playmaking right there. They're shutting down offenses and making it look easy. But let's talk about the Giants for a second. They're not a bad team, they just had a rough game. Eli Manning is still a great quarterback and OBJ is a beast. They just need to regroup and come back stronger next game. Now, let's talk about the playoffs. I'm calling it now, the Redskins, Jags, Bucs, Raiders, and Browns (with Mr. Football) are all playoff contenders. And if they're not, I'll burn all my RG3 gear. Let's be honest though, I'm burning it either way. The Redskins are playing the best football I've ever seen them play and I'm really high on this team right now. It could be the dank, but I really think they have a shot at the playoffs. And let's not forget about the controversy surrounding RG3. Everyone just shits on the guy and downvotes you if you defend him, but it's true. He has no pocket presence and cannot play QB. I hope the Cowboys or some other team picks him up and realizes what they have. He's basically the Trent Richardson of QBs. But let's not dwell on the negative. The Redskins are playing great football and I'm excited to see where they go from here. They have a tough schedule ahead of them, but I think they can handle it. They just need to keep playing like they have been and they'll be in the playoffs in no time. Now, let's talk about the NFL as a whole. It's starting to sound like oil companies on global warming or big tobacco on lung cancer in these stories. It's all about the money. They don't care about player safety or the long-term effects of the game. They just want to make as much money as possible. And let's talk about the punting game. You don't want the best punter in the league. Worst 3rd down conversions and best punter? That's not a good combination. The Redskins need to work on their 3rd down conversions and stop relying on their punter so much. But let's end on a positive note. The Redskins are playing great football and I'm excited to see where they go from here. They have a tough schedule ahead of them, but I think they can handle it. They just need to keep playing like they have been and they'll be in the playoffs in no time. Hail to the Redskins!
