It's no secret that the political opinions of people can shift over time. This is something that has been studied extensively in political analysis and public opinion coursework. One of the most interesting findings in this area is the conclusion that "mass opinion is largely shaped by exposure (via the media) to elite discourse on issues." This means that if the media is controlled by the rich and elite, it is easier for them to shape public opinion to their liking. This is something that we see all the time in the media. Take, for example, the documentary Outfoxed, which exposes the talking point-style "journalism" that is prevalent in many news outlets. This type of reporting is designed to push a certain agenda and shape public opinion in a particular way. It's not that people's opinions are necessarily fluid, but rather that they are malleable when subjected to a well-oiled propaganda machine. This is further supported by a study called Stacked Deck: How the Dominance of Politics by the Affluent & Business Undermines Economic Mobility in America. The study shows a clear rift in the political desires of the rich versus the poor, with the former group having a much greater influence on policy decisions. This is a problem because it means that the needs and desires of the majority of Americans are not being represented in government. Of course, it's important to approach these findings with a healthy dose of skepticism. Politicians are notorious for manipulating survey data to suit their own agendas, and income groups can be difficult to define and measure accurately. Additionally, even if the Republican party is dominated by the rich, the Senate and the Executive branch are supposed to act as a check on their power. However, there are other factors at play that make it difficult for the average American to have their voice heard in government. Gerrymandering, for example, can shape constituencies in a way that favors one party over another. This means that even if the majority of people in a given area support a particular policy, their representative may not because they are more concerned with pleasing their party than their constituents. At the end of the day, it seems that the groups with the most power in American politics are the rich and corporations. This is a problem because it means that policies are being made to benefit a small minority of people rather than the majority. It's a complex issue with no easy solutions, but one thing is clear: we need to find a way to give more power to the people and less to the elite. One potential solution is to localize power. As it stands, Washington has far too much power and has become a focal point for corruption that affects the entire country. By giving more power to state and local governments, we can ensure that decisions are being made by people who are more in touch with the needs and desires of their constituents. Another potential solution is to take a closer look at the banking and corporate industries. Many of these companies have been responsible for major violations of the law, and yet they continue to operate with impunity. By dismantling these companies and using their assets to pay out their victims and promote small business growth, we can create a more stable and just economy. Of course, these are just a few potential solutions, and there are many other factors at play that need to be addressed. But one thing is clear: we need to start taking action to ensure that the needs and desires of the majority of Americans are being represented in government. We can't continue to let the rich and elite control the narrative and shape public opinion to their liking. It's time for a change.
