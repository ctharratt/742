Have you ever wondered how a belt-driven mechanical iris works? Well, wonder no more! This amazing mechanism is built and designed by Simon Morse, and it is truly a work of art. The frame is made from laser-cut aluminum, while the gear paddles are 3D printed and the blades are made from 0.25mm lexan. The result is a mesmerizing and satisfying movement that is sure to leave you in awe. But that's not all! There are so many fascinating things in this world that are just waiting to be discovered. For example, have you ever seen what happens when caesium enters water? It reacts quickly to produce caesium hydroxide (CsOH) and hydrogen (H2). The rapid production of hydrogen produces a bubble of gas around the caesium which stops the caesium from reacting with the water. Eventually, this bubble rises to the surface which exposes the caesium to the water again, and the cycle repeats. But why did it turn pink, you ask? Well, that's because they added phenolphthalein to the water. Phenolphthalein is a colorless, weak acid which dissociates in water forming pink anions. Under acidic conditions, the equilibrium is to the left, and the concentration of the anions is too low for the pink color to be observed. However, under alkaline conditions, the equilibrium is to the right, and the concentration of the anion becomes sufficient for the pink color to be observed. It's amazing how much we can learn from the world around us. And speaking of learning, did you know that title affects a lot? I recently posted a gif about the same thing before this one in /r/oddlysatisfying, but my post only got 13 upvotes in an hour. Then, someone else posted a gif about the same content after 15 minutes and got 500 points in an hour. I never knew that title could affect to this extent. It just goes to show how important it is to choose the right title for your post. But let's get back to the topic at hand. Have you ever wondered how lasers remove tattoos? It's actually quite fascinating. The laser breaks up the pigment colors of the tattoo with a high-intensity light beam. Black tattoo pigment absorbs all laser wavelengths, making it the easiest to treat. Other colors can only be treated by selected lasers based upon the pigment color. The removal happens as your body slowly rids itself of the pigment. The laser breaks the pigment up enough that the body can deal with it. The laser does not blast the pigment away. And speaking of lasers, have you ever seen what happens when a laser hits the skin? It vaporizes the water in the skin, turning it temporarily lighter. In about 20 minutes, that discoloration goes away, and there is no immediate visual reduction to the tattoo. It's amazing how technology has advanced to the point where we can use lasers to remove tattoos and even vaporize water in the skin. But let's not forget about the beauty of nature. Have you ever seen F1 driver Fernando Alonso karting as an adult? It's a fun video that is sure to put a smile on your face. And if you're interested in photography, you can download high-resolution prints for $150. It's amazing how much beauty there is in the world, and how much we can learn from it. In conclusion, there are so many fascinating things in this world that are just waiting to be discovered. From belt-driven mechanical irises to the reaction of caesium in water, there is always something new to learn. And let's not forget about the beauty of nature and the amazing things that technology can do. So go out there and explore the world around you. You never know what you might discover.
