I have to say, I'm quite surprised by the recent developments in Germany's negotiations with Turkey. It seems that Germany is trying to strike a deal with Turkey on the 7th of this month, which would involve Turkey taking back refugees from Greece. However, what surprises me is that there has been no mention of support for Turkey's position on Syria as part of the deal. I would have thought that this would have been an unofficial aspect of the negotiations, or at the very least, that Germany would have avoided upsetting Erdogan before the deal was finalized. I'm curious to see whether this will have any impact on the legal status of German citizens who are fighting with the YPG. I would be surprised if the slow but thorough German justice system doesn't eventually try some regime people who have made their way to Germany and given themselves away. It should be interesting to see how this all plays out. It's worth noting that just because a majority of people are really unhappy with a government, it doesn't necessarily mean that the state has failed. The UK, for example, had to deal with the IRA for many years, but that didn't make it a failed state. It's more a sign of a failed government than a failed state. What's interesting to me is that the German federal prosecutors are not just focusing on ISIS, but are also prosecuting people from other groups as well. This suggests that they are not just going after the low-hanging fruit, but are willing to go after anyone who has committed crimes in Syria. This is a good thing, as it sends a message that no one is above the law. It's also worth noting that the German justice system is not afraid to hand out harsh sentences. For example, in July, Harun P. was found guilty of accessory to murder and attempted murder for his involvement with the Islamist group Jund-al-Sham in Syria. He was sentenced to 11 years in prison. This shows that Germany takes these crimes very seriously and is willing to hand out tough sentences to those who commit them. Moving on to other topics, I find it intensely depressing that so many people involved in the conflict in Syria are liars and crooks. If the allegations against Maliki are true, then he really needs to be tried for treason. It's a sad state of affairs when the people who are supposed to be leading a country are the ones causing the most harm. It's interesting to see that KSA was worried about Syria taking revenge on them before the chemical weapons were destroyed. It just goes to show how complex and interconnected the conflicts in the Middle East are. One action can have far-reaching consequences that are difficult to predict. I'm also intrigued by the speculation that the chemical weapons attack in Syria may have taken place in 2012. It's amazing to think that not much has changed in regards to the attitudes of the people involved in the conflict since then. It's a shame that the story ends there, as I would have liked to know more. In terms of the situation in Syria, it's good to see that there are some areas that are relatively safe for people to live in. However, it's concerning that there are so few of these places. It just goes to show how difficult it is to create stability in a war-torn country. There has been a lot of talk about the concept of an Islamic State recently. It's important to distinguish between the group Islamic State and the concept of an Islamic State. It's questionable whether you can divorce the concept of an Islamic State from conquest, and as soon as you start conquering, you will run into people who have problems with that and call for help. If you want to keep up attacking things in the West, then you will have real attention. It's much easier to conquer people with money, diplomacy, and subterfuge than it is to conquer with overt violence. If someone were to vote for a hardcore interpretation of an Islamic State, then nobody would object too much. It would probably be a North Korea type situation where everybody agrees they are awful but isn't attacking them as long as they stick to their own turf and just abuse their own people and don't venture out too much. However, the problem is the people who already live in a region. It's difficult to create a new state without causing harm to the people who already live there. In conclusion, there are many complex issues at play in the conflicts in the Middle East. It's important to distinguish between the group Islamic State and the concept of an Islamic State. It's also important to remember that just because a majority of people are unhappy with a government, it doesn't necessarily mean that the state has failed. The German justice system is not afraid to hand out tough sentences to those who commit crimes in Syria, which sends a message that no one is above the law. It will be interesting to see how the negotiations between Germany and Turkey play out, and whether there will be any impact on the legal status of German citizens who are fighting with the YPG.
