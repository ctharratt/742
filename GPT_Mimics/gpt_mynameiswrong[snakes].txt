Snakes are fascinating creatures that have captured the attention of humans for centuries. From their unique physical characteristics to their mysterious behavior, snakes have become a popular choice for pet owners around the world. However, with so many different species and varieties to choose from, it can be difficult to know where to start when it comes to selecting the perfect snake for your home. One of the most interesting aspects of snakes is their scales. Scales are made up of hard beta keratins that are mostly transparent, but the colors of the scales are due to pigments in the inner layers of the skin. However, blue and green scales are caused by the ultrastructure of the scales themselves. When light is diffracted by the surface of a blue scale, it gives off a blue hue. When combined with yellow from the inner skin, it creates a beautiful iridescent green color. In fact, some people have even tried to replicate a snake's iridescent properties through experiments. These experiments have shown that getting the thickness and angle of refraction correct is crucial to achieving the desired effect. While the structure of scales is fascinating, there is no evidence to suggest that it is beneficial to the snake in any way. When it comes to selecting a snake as a pet, there are many different species to choose from. Some of the most popular species include rosy boas, sand boas, Mexican black kingsnakes, hognoses, garters, and corns. Each species has its own unique characteristics and care requirements, so it is important to do your research before making a decision. Rosy boas are typically 2-3 feet in length and are easy to care for. Sand boas are also close to this size range and are readily available in the US pet trade. Mexican black kingsnakes are easy to keep, great eaters, and tend to average 3 1/2 feet in length. Hognoses are small and easy to care for, but can be picky eaters. Garters are about the same length as hognoses and are getting more popular, but there is limited information available on their temperament and care requirements. Corns are another popular species of snake that are hardy, easy to care for, and typically quite tolerant of handling. They come in a variety of cool colors and are a medium-sized snake that will get around 5 feet long. While some people think they are small, they are comparable in length to a ball python. If you are new to snakes, it is important to check your state and county laws before making a purchase. Some areas have strict regulations when it comes to species and size. Additionally, it is important to set up the enclosure for at least a week before putting a snake in it to ensure that you are able to maintain the proper temperature and humidity levels. When it comes to purchasing a snake, there are a variety of options available. Some people choose to buy from breeders, while others prefer to adopt from a rescue or purchase from a pet store. Craigslist can also be a good option, but it is important to be cautious and do your research before making a purchase. With Craigslist pickups, there is no guarantee of health that you often get from breeders. If you do decide to purchase a snake from Craigslist, it is important to look for signs of health issues such as mites, scale rot, and respiratory infections. Additionally, it is important to ask what the snake has been eating and whether it has any special care requirements. Don't be afraid to back out of a purchase if the animal is at all questionable unless you have the money and inclination to care for a sick or even terminal snake. Ultimately, the type of snake you choose will depend on your personal preferences and the care requirements that you are able to meet. With proper research and care, snakes can make fascinating and rewarding pets.
