Yo, what's up my fellow Utahns? I gotta say, I'm loving the UTA service. It's saved me so much money on transportation costs, and I can't thank them enough for that. And for all you haters out there, there was no murder, so take your garbage somewhere else, like California. The burn is real, people. But seriously, can we talk about how great Stefahns on 3rd and 4th N is? They specialize in shaves and all things beard, and let me tell you, they do a damn good job. And while we're on the topic of good things, can't I just enjoy a chicken sandwich or a beer without having to hear about all the hate crimes I'm supposedly committing? Come on, SJW friends, give me a break. And what's with all the downvotes? Are we really going to accuse each other of white supremacist terrorism? Let's get over ourselves and focus on the real issues, like the criminal cost of housing here. Those greedy ass Mormons need to chill out with their high prices. But let's not forget about the driving situation here. I mean, come on, Utard drivers are renowned in the West for being the worst drivers in the country. So when I'm driving my huge ass truck, you better believe I'm going extra slow just to piss them off. And speaking of weird things, did anyone else see that AT-AT shooting dicks? I mean, what is this world coming to? And don't even get me started on /r/slc only caring about abortions and gay stuff. Can we please take our bigoted hate elsewhere? But let's end on a positive note. If you're looking for a friendly place to hang out, check out Ex Wives Place. People will come up and talk to you, whether it's good or bad. And if you need a haircut, go see Stefan at Stefans Barbershop. He's one of the new, really rad dudes who used to work at Ray's. Plus, they offer neighborhood discounts. And for all you smokers out there, be smart about it. Don't smoke weed while you're looking for a job. And if you need to get clean, most people I know are clean within a week. Just test yourself to see when you're good to go. And if you're planning a road trip, I highly recommend driving through Wyoming. It's beautiful and peaceful, unlike some parts of Colorado. And beware the shemitah, people. But let's not forget about the food scene here. I mean, some places are just lackluster, like Kathmandu. But Himalayan Kitchen's buffet downtown is where it's at. And whatever you do, don't go to The Bayou. Their food is practically inedible. And for all you parents out there, be careful during the smog inversion event in the winter. It's not good for young children. And if you're looking for a place to live, check out BMG Rentals near 3rd W and 3rd N. It's pretty cheap. And for all you public transportation users, don't listen to the haters. UTA is great, and I've never had an issue with it. And if you're ever lost, just use Google Maps to track the buses. It's a freaking life saver. So there you have it, folks. My ramblings on all things Utah. Let's keep it positive and friendly, and remember to enjoy the little things in life, like a good chicken sandwich or a well-groomed beard. Peace out.
