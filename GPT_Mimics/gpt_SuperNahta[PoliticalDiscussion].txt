Adapting a Nordic model is just plain stupid. I mean, seriously, how can you apply an economic system from a country that has a smaller population than a single state of another country? It just doesn't make any sense. I believe that if a country can afford to create a social system to help people then they should do it, but they have to come up with their own model because applying the same model everywhere can never work. It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. It just doesn't work. And what's this I hear about the Koch brothers endorsing Bernie? I mean, come on, where did you hear this? The written word can't be taken literally. Look at the constitution. There's plenty of debate over what the literal interpretation should be. The same exact sentence can carry many different meanings. This is an accepted truth, you're arguing something you are unfamiliar with. A document must be interpreted by the reader, and will always mean something different to other readers. When people are writing, they don't want you to completely twist it and say something other than what it actually means. What is the point of writing it if so many people are going to interpret it in completely opposite ways? The reason there is so much debate over the constitution is because politicians are twisting the constitution to suit their own political beliefs. The constitution was not made to be interpreted differently by everyone. If people were just going to interpret the constitution in their own way then what the hell is the point of it? And what's this I hear about a Compulsory Purchase Order? I won't pretend to know all the ins and outs of the situation referenced in your "daily record" article from 2012 but I will say a Compulsory Purchase Order means there's a PURCHASE. That's not the same as an eviction, even if it's forceful. What the hell? And that makes it right? They don't want the money, they want to stay in their own homes. I don't care if it does not fit the exact, complete definition of eviction. It is not what a Christian does. Also saying someone you've never met who claims to be Christian, isn't actually a Christian, makes it hard to believe you're a Christian. Sorry, but Christians don't get to judge the faith of others. Well, I'm not a Christian, I personally believe religion is a cancer to society. I will judge Trump if I want and I have not seen anything that makes him even slightly ethical or moral. There is more to being a Christian than just being indoctrinated into believing something. The bible doesn't say rich people can't go to heaven. Yes it does look above. The only thing you have to do to go to heaven is believe in Christ, which is clearly stated in multiple places. So the things I quote from the Bible are meaningless but the things you quote aren't. That's right. But that just proves my point, it still stands that a rich person will not get into heaven. According to the Bible to get into heaven then you must a) not be rich and b) believe in God. So Trump is not a Christian because he doesn't meet requirement A. And what's this I hear about socialism? Haven't heard Bernie saying he wants the removal of the private sector, so he isn't a socialist. The most widely accepted Biblical interpretation "way to get into heaven" is to believe that Christ died for your sins and accept him into your heart and all that, nothing more nothing less will do. So saying rich people are required to also give away their stuff to get into heaven conflicts with that. And what's this I hear about Trump's tax plan? Show me where in that analysis there is evidence people aren't helped across the board. I don't need to prove that people aren't helped, you need to prove that they are helped. You are correct that Trump has spent his time helping himself. But he also hasn't made a career out of destroying others. I don't think he had an epiphany. Being a Christian, is not as simple as just not destroying others, you have to stop helping yourself and help others. But Trump couldn't even manage this. And what's this I hear about Trump looking to make a Compulsory Purchase Order against people living near his golf course? It is when you forcefully evict people from their land, their permission being irrelevant. If you think that is Christian then you are deluded. I have no problem in thinking that Trump may actually be good for the economy, hell who knows, he might even be good for the poor. But face the truth, he is not a Christian. And what's this I hear about donating? Donating is looked highly upon, but should not be expected or assumed of others. You cannot just interpret the bible whatever way makes you feel good about yourself, you have to look at the hard truth. It means what it says. There is no hidden complicated conspiracy meaning to it. It is not hard to understand, it is not a metaphor. "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God" what do you interpret that as? Because the fact remains, it means what it says. In conclusion, it's important to remember that the written word can never be taken literally. There will always be different interpretations of any document, including the constitution and the Bible. It's up to the reader to determine what it means to them. And when it comes to issues like Compulsory Purchase Orders and Trump's tax plan, we need to look at the hard truth and not just interpret things in a way that makes us feel good about ourselves.
