Alright, let's talk about truck drivers. I mean, I get it, they can be annoying on the road. But let's not forget that they're just trying to do their job, which is to transport goods from one place to another. And yeah, sometimes they have to pass slower vehicles, but that's just because they're going slower than the regulated speed of the truck. It's not like they're doing it to inconvenience you. And let's talk about automation. Yeah, it's going to happen eventually, but not in the next five years. There's still a lot of work to be done before we can have fully automated trucks on the road. And even then, there will still need to be a driver in the seat for liability reasons. So let's not get too ahead of ourselves here. But you know what really grinds my gears? People who forget how to drive in the snow. I lived in Colorado for three years and every winter, without fail, there would be a ton of wrecks the first time it snowed. How do people forget how to drive in the snow every year? It's not like it's a new phenomenon. And don't even get me started on the assholes who don't clear the snow off their cars before driving. That's just asking for trouble. And speaking of assholes, let's talk about bad drivers. They come in all shapes and sizes, not just in trucks. But for some reason, truck drivers get a bad rap. Sure, there are some bad ones out there, but there are also a lot of good ones who just want to make their delivery and go home. And let's not forget that the trucking industry is subsidized because it provides a necessary resource. So maybe cut them some slack, huh? And let's talk about passing. Sometimes, it's necessary for a truck to pass a slower vehicle. It's not like they're doing it just to inconvenience you. And sometimes, they have to do it slowly because of the regulated speed of the truck. So maybe don't get so angry when a truck is passing you. They're just trying to do their job. But you know what really grinds my gears? People who don't use their turn signals. Seriously, it's not that hard. Just flick the damn thing up or down and let people know where you're going. It's not rocket science. And let's talk about automation again. Yeah, it's going to happen eventually, but there are still a lot of questions that need to be answered. Like who's going to pay for it? And how are we going to replace every single truck on the road with an automated version? It's not like it's going to happen overnight. But you know what really grinds my gears? People who don't understand the importance of truck drivers. They're the ones who transport goods from ports and train stations to store shelves and stockrooms. Without them, we wouldn't have the things we need to live our daily lives. So maybe show them a little respect, huh? And let's talk about bad drivers again. They come in all shapes and sizes, not just in trucks. But for some reason, truck drivers get a bad rap. Sure, there are some bad ones out there, but there are also a lot of good ones who just want to make their delivery and go home. And let's not forget that the trucking industry is subsidized because it provides a necessary resource. So maybe cut them some slack, huh? And let's talk about snow again. Seriously, how do people forget how to drive in the snow every year? It's not like it's a new phenomenon. And don't even get me started on the assholes who don't clear the snow off their cars before driving. That's just asking for trouble. And let's talk about automation one more time. Yeah, it's going to happen eventually, but there are still a lot of questions that need to be answered. Like who's going to pay for it? And how are we going to replace every single truck on the road with an automated version? It's not like it's going to happen overnight. In conclusion, let's all just try to be a little more understanding of truck drivers. They're just trying to do their job, which is to transport goods from one place to another. And let's not forget that the trucking industry is subsidized because it provides a necessary resource. So maybe cut them some slack, huh? And let's all try to remember how to drive in the snow, use our turn signals, and show a little respect for our fellow drivers on the road.
