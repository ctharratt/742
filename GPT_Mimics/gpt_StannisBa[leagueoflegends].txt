Alright, let's talk about the state of League of Legends and the different regions. First off, let me just say that NA is objectively the worst major region right now. I know some of you fanboys out there might not want to hear it, but it's the truth. Just look at the records and the quality of games. It's a joke of a region right now where a team like Immortals, who have four overrated players, can dominate the league, or a team like CLG, who had one good player (Doublelift), could win NA. Now, let's compare NA to other regions. China is still a better region than NA. They have four teams that are good right now, while NA has none. I mean, maybe by Worlds NA will have three good teams (like TSM, TL, and NRG or something), but right now it's just sad. LGD is a bottom tier team in LPL right now, while TSM is a top 4 NA team. And don't even get me started on C9 with Hai losing to a 3-day-old H2K. It's just embarrassing. And let's not forget about the other bottom of the barrel teams in NA like Renegades, Echo Fox, Dignitas, and TiP. TiP isn't even a real team! They're a mess and it's painful to watch. Neither of those other teams are close to the clusterfuck that TiP is. These past four TiP games and the overall low quality of games in the NA LCS really show how weak NA is right now. I really don't think a TiP team would win games in EU/OGN/LMS/LPL. Now, let's talk about the other regions. Korea is obviously the strongest region right now. They have the best players, the best teams, and the best infrastructure. It's not even close. China is still a strong region, but they've had some issues with their teams underperforming. Taiwan is also a strong region, with Flash Wolves and AHQ being very competitive. Europe is a bit of a wildcard. They have some good teams like G2 and H2K, but they also have some weaker teams like Origen and Roccat. But let's not forget about the quality of games in these regions. Worlds 2015 was a joke. The games were sloppy and the meta was all over the place. And let's not forget about the longest game time of any region in a fast-game meta. It just doesn't make sense. And don't even get me started on the LPL. They've had some really sloppy games this year, especially against bottom tier teams like Dignitas. Now, let's talk about some specific players and teams. First off, LGD lost Homme and Chris and had to use Firefox as "coach". Then Pyl tilted off the face of the earth and couldn't and can't lead the team. It's just sad to see a team that was once so dominant fall so far. And let's not forget about Koro1. He was a beast at S5 Worlds, but he's just not the same player in the Spring Split/MSI. And Tabzz is another player who's just not the same as he was in Season 3. It's just sad to see these players fall off like this. And let's talk about some specific teams. CLG and TL are mid-tier NA teams, but TL can get better and C9 is always a wildcard. But Aphromoo and Darshan suck, dude. I downgraded Xmithie, I'll admit. RO got fucked by Bengi. And RO is not better than Clearlove, he was just carried by Riot being retarded. And let's not forget about the fact that LGD was underperforming heavily versus Dignitas. It's just sad to see a team that was once so dominant fall so far. And let's not forget about the fact that some players are just overrated. Immortals has four overrated players. Lustboy is a top 3 defensive support of all time, but he's just not the same player he was in Summer 2014 and Spring 2015. And Kiwikid is just bad. It's painful to watch him play sometimes. Now, let's talk about some specific games. SKT vs. EM Fire was horrible, but TIP vs. anyone is just painful to watch. And let's not forget about the fact that some games are just shit shows. It's actually pretty disrespectful to call some of these games "strategic". And let's not forget about the fact that some phrases are just memes at this point. Cyka Blyat is just a meme, barely any Russians say that phrase. And let's not forget about the fact that some people just don't understand the game. Hai gets credit for everything the team does, but he's just not that good. And let's not forget about the fact that some people just don't understand the regions. LMS is the one major region I don't watch, so I can't name the three bottom LMS teams. And let's not forget about the fact that some people just don't understand history. Poland was a puppet state to the USSR, owned by the USSR but governed by the Polish government. And let's not forget about the fact that some people just don't understand the game at a high level. Smeb is one of the few players who stays at a high level once they got to a high level. He's just that good. In conclusion, NA is objectively the worst major region right now. It's just sad to see a region that was once so dominant fall so far. But let's not forget about the other regions and the quality of games in those regions. And let's not forget about the specific players and teams that are overrated or underperforming. And let's not forget about the fact that some games are just shit shows. It's just sad to see the state of League of Legends right now.
