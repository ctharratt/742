Yepp, I was just scrolling through my feed and saw this crazy video of a machine that measures the length of a tree and cuts it in precise lengths. It's like something out of a sci-fi movie, but apparently, it's been around for a while. There's a school near me where they teach forestry and how to operate these machines, and let me tell you, it's not easy. But once you get the hang of it, it's like second nature. But here's the thing, I saw this video of a rollercoaster that's supposed to be the fastest and most thrilling ride ever, but if the rails don't lock properly, people could fall straight down and crash and die in a cool way. I mean, I'm not saying it's more dangerous than any other rollercoaster, but the harness and seats aren't made for going from 70+mph to 0 instant. And let's not forget about the rails, they have to match up pretty good for the cart to keep on the track when it's going down. If those rails don't lock correctly, it looks like they would just be sent straight down into the track to crash and die. Cool, right? And speaking of cool, have you seen this video of a guy launching a sword? I mean, it's not just any sword, it's a hollow sword that he's slinging like a weapon. It's like something out of a video game. But some people are saying it's not a sword, it's just a launcher that looks like a sword. I don't know, man, it looks like a sword to me. But let's talk about something a little more serious, like this picture of a boat producing all that black smoke right next to the melting icebergs. The irony is not lost on me. And don't even get me started on the fact that they hunt these amazing-looking animals and mount them on their walls. I mean, sure, they're pests, but that doesn't mean we should just kill them all. And have you heard Avicii's new song? It's also in YouTube VR, which is pretty cool. But I don't really know much about basketball, so I can't really comment on that video. But I did see this video of a guy shooting a deer with some crazy welding gun. I don't know why we're not funding this kind of technology more. And speaking of technology, have you seen this video of a machine that blows air upwards and creates all these crazy shapes? It's like magic, but apparently, it's just video effects. Still pretty cool though. But let's not forget about the important things, like this video of a big-ass tuna. I mean, what type of tuna is that? It looks like a blue fin, but those teeth are something else. And have you seen this video of a wave that just keeps going and going? I wonder how long it would last in real life. And finally, let's talk about this picture of a bunch of people in traditional Norwegian clothing. They're probably celebrating the Norwegian Constitution Day, which is pretty cool. But some people are saying the picture is fake, and I can see why. It just doesn't look right. Anyway, that's all I have to say about that. I'm just going to sit back and enjoy the rest of my feed.
