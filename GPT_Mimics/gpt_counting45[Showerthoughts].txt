No. Not purring. Sometimes if you startle a cat or a cat looks at you very happy like when it knows it's about to obtain a pet, and it doesn't do a full blown meow but it hums a little bit. It's especially satisfying when they're purring as it sounds more muffled. Well a showerthought doesn't have to be correct statement or clever. this one is supposedly clever, but fails, and in that failure I upvote it. I hope your skin flaps clear up. Have a nice day, man good. I like novelty accounts and honestly I enjoy looking at usernames such as yours and then reading thoughtful and insightful comments from such. Sure. /r/counting sub is a place where people count things. We have the big counting threads where it was first started at 1 many years ago. Now we are at 815,000. Each comment must be only 1 count. You cannot reply to your own comment to count. You have to wait for someone to reply to you then you can count again. Meaning, you can count evens while someone counts odds. There are statistics in the sub for how fast each 1000 is counted by people, some 1000 counts take an hour, some have taken days. Depends on the traffic to the sub and a lot of other factors. It can go really quickly which involves refreshing the page a lot. The fastest reply count I have seen was one second, I myself have had a few two second replies which are also not easy. It can be highly competitive for some people. There is no rhyme or reason why people count some people like it because it is something to do and they are bored, other people like the satisfaction from obtaining a GET. A GET is having the count at the end of a thread. Because of server strain on reddit, each thread can only be 1,000 counts. So the GET would be 1000,2000,3000...etc The assist would be 999,1999,2999...etc which is also highly sought after. There are other things to count of course in the sub, some include binary counting, counting letters, counting in spanish, counting by writing out numbers, Hex counting, palindrome counting, subreddit counting, and other random counts. You see I was going to type "R" but then for some reason that I don't understand I typed in my comment that I type reddit.com Which is not true all I type is r and hit enter like you. I have no idea why I typed out reddit.com I don't understand why I do things sometimes. On reddit I can fully explain things I do and yet sometimes I hold back. In addition, sometimes I still type out reddit.com in my browser even though I know I only have to type r and hit enter. I get this fulfillment by doing it other times I do not care. I also have this problem. Once I am bored with reddit, I will close it. Then immediately open another tab and type in reddit.com and I'm back again. It reminds me when I go to the fridge to look for something to eat. I look inside and nothing I want to eat is there, so I close the door. Then I open it back up and find something I possibly will eat just to close the door and go sit down. Then I get back up and go open the fridge again and eat some old leftover. One time I got pissed off at reddit and decided to quit. I didn't make it two hours before I was back on reddit again. Then, yesterday, I noticed on the front page a /r/WTF post about a porn and I looked at it and it appeared to be a woman sucking the prolapsed rectum of another girl. I thought perhaps my reddit days were over then. However they are not....and subsequently I masturbated. Not to that porn mind you, that would be strange for me. But it did have me go to xnxx.com and look up some Big Ass and Lesbian porn. I stay on reddit for other reasons. See, I steal all the shower thoughts from this sub and post them on my facebook. I'm on #65 right now. All my facebook friends think they're mine even though I have stated I copypasta from reddit. Reddit has made me popular on my facebook which gives me a sort of satisfaction I didn't have before. I'm more popular than political posts and this makes me smile. Also, I see things days sometimes weeks before my friends do which keeps me ahead of the curve. My friends think I'm this awesome person who knows things. I do not though. I just read reddit. Thanks reddit. I also keep coming back to count. I like to count. I just count 1..2....3...4 over at the sub /r/counting. It's satisfying when I am able to count even numbers or when I get the count on the thousand. Sometimes when counting I tell people they had an excellent count even though it's no different than the count preceding them. I don't know why I do this. I just call them remakes. No. Not purring.
