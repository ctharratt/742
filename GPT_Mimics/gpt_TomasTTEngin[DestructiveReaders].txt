Skopos knew about Chloe Angelo even before she was born. The system paid close attention - very close - to who she might become. This is a wonderful story. I enjoyed it a lot. Looking at the comments people have made in the document, I think there are perfectly valid stylistic justifications for almost all the decisions you have made. You could take the comments or leave them. I saw no grammar issues. My suggestion is at a more macro level. The story is engaging, but it does contain some cliches. The concept of a hot serial killer is a bit overdone, and I think you could change it in a way that makes it both less cliched and more engaging. The first section of the story could be longer, with multiple paragraphs that offer great characterisation and insight into the protagonist. For example, she could reject people in the bar, and we could get a sense of her criteria for a kill and her personality. She could also talk at length to the man in question, and we could learn more about why she acts in the way she does. Additionally, she could have a chat with the bartender in a way that suggests he reacts to her with concern or in some unusual way.  The risk in my suggested approach would be twofold: You write some boring crap that ruins the piece, or you give away the ending a bit earlier to a fraction of the readership. But I suspect that wouldn't hurt the piece too much. Knowing the way people read, I suspect they enjoy a good twist they've picked in advance (validation!) almost as much as one they didn't see coming (shock!).  Your writing is clear enough that I'd happily read more. Much as Kevin found himself at his end rather unexpectedly, the whole story was over too soon.  Moving on to the second piece, the writing is effective overall, but there are too many sentences that are puffier than the puffy man in the story. The front end of the story is where the long, crappy, overwrought sentences lurk. Every writer obsesses over the start and rewrites the start. So that tells me your natural instinct is to write clean, but your conscious brain is telling you to fatten up those sentences like a Frenchman with his goose.  Your eye for detail is red hot. I love the pleather trousers on the ground, the old woman's tan, the tinny voice through the phone, the word sexy on the back of the sweat pants. But you need to trust yourself on that skill. Present the details simply and have faith that they're working their magic. Not every spell needs a long incantation - sometimes you just need to jiggle the wand.  There are also typos and some disappointing parts where you've used words that don't exist or whose meaning is wrong or hidden. For example, hair-whipping, shuttered, lamaze, and rolled himself up.  Lastly, a piece like this should have a reason to be lifted from among the infinite number of life experiences and turned into a story. What's the lesson here? Perhaps a theme of feeling shame and regret and pondering responsibility for your actions fits the events. Pick a theme and subtly mention it into the introduction. This is a simple trick to create the impression in the reader of a unified thematic whole, and it can be quite impressive.  The short-to-long chapters approach could work, but short chapters have to mean little info. You seemed to be using short chapters and still trying to get us to a point of understanding everything about the world fast.  In conclusion, both pieces have their strengths and weaknesses. The first piece could benefit from more characterisation and a less cliched concept, while the second piece could use simpler sentences and a clearer theme. However, both writers have potential and I would be interested in reading more of their work.
