I was looking at a map the other day and it got me thinking about a lot of different things. First of all, I noticed that Harvard wasn't included in the game I was playing, which was a bit surprising. But then I saw that MIT was included, although it was called CIT in the game. It's interesting how certain places become more well-known than others, even if they're both prestigious universities. Then I noticed a familiar grey shape in central Europe. It was the Benelux region, which includes Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. I've always been fascinated by this area, as it's one of the most densely populated regions in the world. Both the Hague/Rotterdam and the Amsterdam metropolitan areas are larger in population than the Brussels metropolitan area. It's amazing to think about how so many people can live in such a small area. As a Dutchman, I've spoken to South Africans a few times and I can say that Afrikaans sounds like a simplified version of Dutch. Some letters have disappeared and some words have been replaced by other words with a very literal meaning. But when I pay a bit of attention, I can understand it. It sounds rather funny, as if someone who isn't very proficient at speaking Dutch is still trying. So yeah, it's very much a new language. Not strange seeing as how it evolved 'half a world away' for so long, but still mostly understandable! I also came across a map that showed the potential effects of climate change. It showed the south of England and the Netherlands effectively turning into a desert. Also, the interior of Australia will transform to 'no longer farmable'. It really isn't already. No topsoil, rocky, evaporation rates tens of times higher than precipitation rates. Kind of a weird theory or map anyway. Then again, I'm no climatologist. I've traveled quite a bit in Europe and I can say that staying in Luxembourg City or in Frankfurt (about 2 hours apart with German Autobahn speed of about 150 KMH) does feel very different. It's interesting how even a short distance can make such a big difference in terms of culture and atmosphere. I also started thinking about the political implications of the Benelux region. If the three countries were to unify, they would hypothetically get less seats in the EU Parliament, but it could be seen as more power behind 'one voice'. I know that the MEP's in the parliament are split up into larger groups regardless of nationality, so I'm not necessarily referring to that. We'd need a good deal of cooperation between the Benelux countries to get the same message across as three separate nations. For example, what Germany, France, or the UK says concerning EU politics, in national politics so outside of the EU Parliament, is news all over the EU and it actually feels like it matters. What Belgium or the Netherlands say (or any of the smaller nations for that matter), not so much. I also thought about the concept of distance and how it affects our perception of things. Starting in Trieste, Italy, you can go to Villach in Austria in 2 hours. Or to Ljubljana in Slovenia. Starting in Luxembourg, you can pretty much get to one of the larger cities in the Netherlands, Germany, or France within 2 hours, not just some random village either. Those are some examples of 2 hours making a pretty big difference. Sure, if you live in southern Italy or central Poland, two hours makes a lot less difference, but the post you're responding to clearly stated 'depending on where from'. I also thought about the possibility of the Netherlands and Belgium unifying. The Dutch would, in majority, welcome unifying with (at least) Flanders. Sure, there are cultural differences, but there are cultural differences between the northeastern, western, and southern regions of the Netherlands as well, which never seem to be a real problem either. Visiting Belgium regularly, without border control and largely being able to speak my mother tongue makes it feel like a second home, anyway. I'm Dutch. Belgium seems to be doing alright though, despite those problems. We're unlikely to ever unify anyway, but I have always liked the idea :-) I also came across a map that showed the elevation of different countries. It was interesting to see how some countries are almost entirely flat, while others have a lot of variation in elevation. For example, the Netherlands is one of the flattest countries in the world, with an average elevation of only 30 meters above sea level. Qatar is even flatter, with a highest elevation of just over 100 meters. It's amazing to think about how different the world can be in terms of geography. Finally, I thought about the accuracy of maps and how they can be distorted. Even on maps like these where a country's outline is essentially being dragged over another country, it's still distorted. In this case, the northern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo is enlarged, while the southern part is shrunk. So, it's still not an accurate comparison. It's important to keep in mind that maps are just representations of reality and not reality itself. Overall, looking at maps can be a fascinating and thought-provoking experience. It can make us think about distance, culture, politics, and geography in new and interesting ways.
