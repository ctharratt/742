Hey there, friend. I see you're going through a tough time with your Nparent. I've been there, and I know how overwhelming it can be. But let me tell you, you've got this. You're stronger than you think, and you have the power to break free from their grasp. One thing that helped me was finding support in online communities like /r/Nrelationships. There are so many people out there who have gone through similar experiences and can offer advice and encouragement. Take a look at the sidebar for related subreddits, and don't be afraid to reach out for help. I know it can be hard to stand up to your Nparent, but remember that they don't actually have any power over you. It's all a farce. They may try to manipulate and control you, but you know the truth. Stay calm and stick to your plans, and don't let them bring you down. Growing up with an Nparent can be incredibly isolating. I remember feeling like I couldn't pursue my interests or hobbies because my Nparent would always find a way to sabotage them. But don't let them hold you back. You deserve to explore your passions and find joy in life. Even if it's something as simple as drawing, find something that brings you happiness and hold onto it. It's also important to remember that you're not alone. Many of us with Nparents have siblings who have also been affected by their behavior. It's important to stick together and support each other. My siblings and I used to be pitted against each other by our Nparent, but we eventually realized what was happening and banded together. It's made all the difference. I know it can be tempting to try to keep the peace with your Nparent, but don't let them trample all over you. You're an adult now, and you have the right to make your own decisions and live your life on your own terms. If your Nparent is trying to manipulate you into doing something you don't want to do, stand your ground. Make plans with your partner or friends and insist that they're non-negotiable. You deserve to live your life free from their toxic influence. Remember, you're not alone. There are so many of us out there who have gone through similar experiences and come out the other side stronger. You've got this. Keep pushing forward, and don't let your Nparent hold you back. The freedom you'll feel when you finally break free will be worth it.
