The world is constantly changing, and with it, the way we receive and process information. The industrial revolution is long gone, and we are now in the information age. This means that we have access to more information than ever before, and we can use it to make informed decisions about the world around us. One of the ways we receive information is through traditional media, such as radio and television. However, with the rise of social media, we now have access to news and information in real-time. This has changed the way we consume news and has given us a new perspective on world events. For example, on October 21st, 2014, there was a kidnapping attempt in Turkey that was paid for by IS. This raises the question of whether IS would pay for an American after their last two hostages were decapitated. One of these hostages was a 26-year-old westerner with good, humanitarian intentions in the region. This is a tragic event that highlights the dangers of working in conflict zones. However, it is important to note that incidents like this are not unique to Turkey. Hostages have been taken and beheadings have occurred in almost every country in the world. It is a sad reality of the world we live in, and it is up to us to be aware of the risks and take precautions when necessary. One of the benefits of social media is that it allows us to receive news and information in real-time. This means that we can stay up-to-date on world events as they happen. For example, during the heart of the recession, there was a capital supply issue. Businesses needed capital to grow, but banks were hesitant to lend money in the current economic climate. Social media allowed businesses to stay informed about the state of the economy and make informed decisions about their future. However, it is important to use discretion when consuming news and information on social media. Not everything on social media is true, and it is up to us to verify the information before we act on it. For example, there were immediate reports of an attack in Syria that killed civilians and involved chemical weapons. While these reports were later confirmed, it is important to verify the information before we act on it. Social media has also changed the way we receive news about warzones. It is now the best way to learn about warzones, as it allows us to receive news and information in real-time. For example, the air strikes in Syria were reported on Twitter 30 minutes prior to the US announcement. This shows the power of social media in providing us with up-to-date information about world events. However, it is important to remember that social media can be used for propaganda purposes. For example, videos released by militant Islamist groups are intended to help recruitment, and while the audience may be Western at face value, it is actually marketing material. It is up to us to use our critical thinking skills and verify the information before we act on it. The situation in Syria is a complex one, and it highlights the challenges of dealing with militant Islamist groups. The humanitarian crisis that Assad is perpetuating is a textbook definition of a war crime, and it is a lose-lose situation for the world until something is done about it. However, it is important to remember that Assad is not the only guilty party in this conflict. Militant Islamist groups like IS are also committing war crimes, and it is up to us to hold them accountable for their actions. In conclusion, the information age has changed the way we receive and process information. Social media has given us access to news and information in real-time, and it has changed the way we consume news. However, it is important to use discretion when consuming news and information on social media, as not everything is true. We must use our critical thinking skills and verify the information before we act on it. The situation in Syria is a complex one, and it highlights the challenges of dealing with militant Islamist groups. It is up to us to hold these groups accountable for their actions and work towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
