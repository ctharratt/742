The criminal justice system in the United States has long been a topic of controversy, with many arguing that it is a mechanism of racial and class control. This argument is not without merit, as there is ample evidence to suggest that the criminal justice system disproportionately targets people of color and those from low-income backgrounds. From the very first sentence, it is clear that the criminal justice system is not a fair and impartial institution. Instead, it is a tool used by those in power to maintain their control over marginalized communities. This is evident in the way that law enforcement is used to extract wealth from black citizens, as was seen in Ferguson. However, the issue of racial and class control is not limited to generating revenue for law enforcement. It is a much broader problem that affects every aspect of society. Those in power use the criminal justice system to control the black and/or low-income population, making them exploitable and vulnerable to further oppression. It is important to note that this is not a new phenomenon. The Jim Crow laws of the past were designed to do the same thing, and it is clear that the policies and practices of the criminal justice system have not changed much since then. The question that must be asked is whether implementing policies to stop this function of the criminal justice system would simply result in another system taking its place. There is a reason why the criminal justice system has these policies in place. It is a sustainable business model that benefits those in power. However, being the go-to fundraising site for bigots is bad for their brand, and so they must find ways to maintain their control without being too obvious about it. One of the ways that those in power maintain their control is through the use of free speech. While everyone has the right to free speech, it is clear that some use this right to limit the free speech of others. This is a special pleading fallacy, as arguing for limiting another's free speech is contradictory to the principle of free speech itself. Furthermore, using one's free speech to call for censorship is not censorship. It is simply exercising one's right to free speech. However, it is important to note that protesting is also a form of free speech, and it is not censorship to respond to the free speech of others with censorship. The issue of racism and discrimination is not one that can be solved overnight. It requires a fundamental shift in the way that we think about and approach these issues. This requires open discourse with open minds, and a willingness to listen to and learn from those who have been marginalized and oppressed. It is clear that those in power have a responsibility to use their privilege to effect change. This means acknowledging the ways in which they have benefited from systems of oppression, and actively working to dismantle those systems. It also means listening to and amplifying the voices of those who have been marginalized and oppressed. However, it is important to note that change cannot come solely from those in power. It requires a collective effort from all members of society. This means engaging in open and honest dialogue about the ways in which racism and discrimination affect us all, and working together to create a more just and equitable society. In conclusion, the criminal justice system in the United States is a mechanism of racial and class control. It is a tool used by those in power to maintain their control over marginalized communities, and it is clear that this is not a new phenomenon. However, change is possible, but it requires a fundamental shift in the way that we think about and approach these issues. It requires open discourse with open minds, and a willingness to listen to and learn from those who have been marginalized and oppressed. It is only through collective action that we can create a more just and equitable society for all.
