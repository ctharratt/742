Hey there, fellow Redditors! It's your friendly neighborhood mod, here to remind you of the rules. We've had a lot of submissions lately that just don't quite meet our standards, so I'm here to give you a rundown of what's been going on. First off, we've had a lot of users who don't meet our age/activity requirements. Now, I know it can be frustrating to be told you're not old enough or active enough to participate, but trust me, it's for your own good. We want to make sure that everyone who's contributing to the community is doing so in a meaningful way, and that means having a certain level of experience and maturity. Next up, we've had a lot of people asking for help with their homework. Now, I get it, school can be tough, but we're not here to do your work for you. We want to encourage learning and growth, not cheating and shortcuts. So please, don't ask for homework help. It's against the rules, and it's just not cool. And finally, we've had a lot of people posting tasks without offering any payment. Now, I know some of you might be thinking, "But, I don't have any money to offer!" And that's okay, we understand that not everyone has the means to pay for tasks. But if you're asking someone to do something for you, you need to offer something in return. It could be a trade, a favor, or even just a heartfelt thank you. But you need to offer something. So there you have it, folks. The rules are simple, but they're important. We want to make sure that everyone who's participating in our community is doing so in a positive and meaningful way. So please, read the rules, follow the rules, and if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to message the mods. We're here to help.
