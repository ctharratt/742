Hey guys, I was just browsing through /r/socialism and I couldn't help but notice that there seems to be some tension between them and the Maoists. From what I understand, it has to do with third worldism or something? Correct me if I'm wrong.  But you know what I've noticed about some socialists? They tend to use anti-Semitic dog whistle language. Now, I'm not saying that this is the majority usage anywhere but on Reddit and Stormfront, but it's definitely something to keep an eye out for.  Have you ever met a pro-Palestine Muslim? It's like a tax in Germany. I mean, come on, it's basically mandatory and around 75% of the healthcare costs are paid for by the state.  If you want to read more about it, it really depends on the country. But where do people even get the idea that Norway is all of Europe? It's just ridiculous.  And don't even get me started on Dota versus League. In my experience, Dota is a lot nicer and it has voice chat. Sure, some people might be toxic over voice chat, but that's just a risk you have to take.  Now, when it comes to housing people, I don't think the state, which is owned by corporations, is simply going to let you tax corporations to house people. It's just not realistic. But hey, it happens in much of the world, so who knows?  I'm also not a fan of the Welt, but they're definitely not even close to the Daily Mail. And let's not forget that there were over a thousand reported incidents on NYE in Cologne alone. Dozens of groping incidents and a few rapes? That's just not acceptable.  And you know what? I've been hearing a lot about Bernie in the German media ever since Iowa. It's definitely creating some unnecessary strife, but I'm glad to see that he's getting some recognition.  As for religion, I think it's called being a cultural Christian. And let's not forget that there are always weirdos on forums, even Muslim ones. But I have yet to find a Muslim forum that's not batshit crazy except for the tiny /r/progressive_islam.  And don't even get me started on Witcher 3. Sure, the ending was weak, but I still played through the game in a weekend without sleep. And let's not forget that there are tons of foreigners in Syria, not just Islamist ones.  Overall, I think it's important to keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions based on biases or personal opinions. And let's not forget that taste is a matter of opinion, so let's not judge people too harshly based on their gaming preferences.
