I don't know if it would work with pigs of those ages but when I needed to get mine to get along, I gave them a bath together. I washed them in the same tub with the same shampoo at the same time. I also washed their new cage in the same shampoo. That way they all smelled alike. After weeks of fighting and not being able to be together, they were huddling in the tub. Strength in numbers I guess. Ever since then they got along perfectly. But now, I'm dealing with a different issue. One of my pigs, Melt, passed away last week. It was a tough loss for me and for Gizmo, my other pig. They were cage mates and had been together for years. After Melt passed, Gizmo seemed to be grieving. She was sitting in her house more often and not getting as excited about food. It was heartbreaking to see her like that. But then, I noticed something else. I felt a lump on Gizmo's stomach. I made an appointment with the vet and we found out that Gizmo likely had an infection, though there was a small chance of a cancerous tumor. We were given antibiotics and told to do a warm compress followed by some pressure to help get some of the infection out. It's been a tough few days. My girlfriend and I have been taking turns giving Gizmo her medication and doing the warm compress. We've also been making sure she has plenty of fresh greens and water. It's been a lot of work, but we're determined to help Gizmo get better. The vet gave us enough medication to last two weeks, but it ran out three days early. We called the vet and asked if they could give us enough for the last three days and they said sure. We got to the office and they thought we needed a full refill and asked for $95.00. We told them we only needed enough for three more days. The doctor then said that since the medication was already in the bottles they couldn't put them back so we could just take the whole full dose free of charge. So we have another two weeks worth. But even with the medication, Gizmo's progress has been slow. The vet believes that she may end up needing surgery, thinking it's a tumor. We also have to take her to get her teeth filed down. The bottom teeth are so long that they're becoming a problem for her. Throughout it all, Gizmo has been a trooper. She's still been eating mostly normal and seems to be in good spirits. We've been doing the warm compress and pressure to help get some of the infection out. It's not a pleasant process, but it seems to be working. The stuff coming out has been a darker, slightly browning colored blood. Today when we did it, it was normal red colored blood. I think that's a good sign, like the infection is clearing out of her bloodstream. We're also trying to make sure Gizmo stays hydrated. We've noticed that she's not drinking as much water as usual, so we've been giving her lots of greens that have just been washed and cucumbers to give her things with water in them. We're also going to start looking at another friend for her once she's healed up. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions these past few days. Losing Melt was tough, but dealing with Gizmo's illness has been even tougher. But we're determined to help her get better. We're doing everything we can to make sure she's comfortable and getting the care she needs. I know some people might think it's silly to go to such lengths for a pet, but Gizmo is more than just a pet to me. She's a member of our family. And just like I would do anything for my human family members, I'll do anything for Gizmo. I'm grateful for all the support and well wishes we've received. It means a lot to know that there are people out there who care. And to anyone else who might be going through something similar with their pet, know that you're not alone. It's tough, but we'll get through it together.
