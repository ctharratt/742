As I walked down the street, I overheard a heated argument between two students. "The world is flat, anyone who says otherwise is a fool!" Periandrus exclaimed. "Can you prove that is so, or are you making only hypotheses like the rest of them?" Cleto retorted. The rest of the students looked on, waiting to see who would come out on top. Periandrus pointed to the port, "One only needs to take a short walk down to the port, to see that I'm right." Cleto squinted at him, "Why is it that when you observe a departing ship in the port, it just becomes smaller and smaller until it fades into the horizon. If the world was round, as you claim, wouldn't you then see it sink into the sea before disappearing?" "That may just be because the curvature is too slight and the ship escapes our field of vision before its effects become noticeable," Periandrus made a dismissive gesture. "You always have excuses for everything, Cleto, I'm tired of you." "They're called arguments Periandrus. Just because they contradict you doesn't mean they're not fair," Cleto replied. "Find an argument again this, then Cleto," Periandrus challenged. Cleto nodded, "Tell me Cleto. You accept of course that the Sun travels around the Earth?" "Yeah, that is common knowledge, that's why it rises in the east and sets in the west," Periandrus replied. "You accept also that a lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun gets behind the Earth and the Earth's shadow is cast on the Moon, hiding it," Cleto continued. "Of course," Periandrus shrugged. "Why is it then Cleto, if as you say Earth is a sphere, that when we have a lunar eclipse the edge of the Earth's shadow as it swallows the earth, is not round?" Periandrus asked. Everybody stood silent, unsure of how to respond. It was a valid point, and one that had never been brought up before. As the argument died down, I couldn't help but think about how we often cling to our beliefs without truly examining them. We become so convinced of our own ideas that we refuse to consider any other possibilities. But what if we were wrong? What if the world was not flat, but round? What other beliefs were we holding onto without truly examining them? I thought about this as I walked into work. My boss was waiting for me, and I knew what was coming. "Why do you want to quit your job?" he asked. "I want to pursue a career as an author," I replied. "Will you be able to support yourself on writing alone?" he asked. "Yeah boss. You should see me in r/writingprompts! I have like five hundred karma or something, I've lost count. And on Wattpadâ€¦ oh boy, oh boy I have like two thousand reads. All I need is some free time. I'm telling you boss I'm gonna just shoot up," I pointed at the ceiling smiling. "I hope the best for you, but I don't think it will be that easy. It takes years to reach a point where you're able to support yourself from writing. Maybe you should just pursue it in your free time," he suggested. "What free time boss? You know the drill we're lucky if we get off at seven in this shithole," I shook my head. "That's how investment firms are, what can I say. But at least here you got potential, you can rise through the ranks," he said. "Yeah in like ten years, pff," I made a dismissive gesture. "If you made up your mind there's nothing I can say," he sighed. I knew he was right, but I couldn't help but feel frustrated. I wanted to pursue my dreams, but it seemed like the world was against me. I walked out of his office, feeling defeated. As I walked down the street, I thought about the argument between Periandrus and Cleto. I realized that sometimes we need to challenge our beliefs, even if it's uncomfortable. We need to be open to new ideas and perspectives, even if they contradict our own. I thought about this as I walked into the coffee shop. The barista greeted me with a smile, "Do you have a Fuel Rewards card?" she asked. "Yeah, here you go," I handed her my card. "Thank you very much sir, have a nice day," she said. "Have a nice day too kid, and good luck with that thing of yours," I replied. As I sat down with my coffee, I thought about my dreams of becoming a writer. Maybe it wouldn't be easy, but I knew it was what I wanted. I needed to challenge my beliefs and pursue my passions, even if it meant taking a risk. I picked up my pen and started writing. It was time to explore the darkness within me and see where it would take me.
