It is a common misconception that the conflict between Israel and Palestine is solely based on settlement and occupation. The truth is that the conflict has deep roots in Palestinian xenophobia and anti-Semitism that existed long before the arrival of European Jews. In fact, rising anti-Semitic pogroms in Jerusalem in 1847 and again in 1870 were correlated with Palestinian xenophobia that existed before the arrival of European Jews. This is a fact that is often overlooked in discussions about the conflict. It is also important to note that the Palestinian people have been brainwashed into supporting terrorism by their leaders. If not for that, there would be no occupation, no patrols, no home destructions, etc. If rockets weren't stored in homes, there would be no problems. If Palestinian terrorism didn't precede the occupation, there would be no occupation. There's a reason occupation began in 1967, two years after the beginning of Fatah (group now running the West Bank) attacks on Israeli civilians. They can bolster whatever they want. That's not what they sought to do. What they sought to do was destroy the Jewish nation, in a "war of extermination" (their words, not mine). The fact that 63% of Palestinians support killing Israeli civilians inside Israel is a testament to the deep-seated hatred and xenophobia that exists within Palestinian society. This is not a conflict that can be solved by simply ending the occupation or by creating a Palestinian state. The Palestinian leadership must take responsibility for the radicalization of their people and the support of terrorism. They must stop using aid money to fund terrorism and start investing in infrastructure, manufacturing, and services for their own people. Taxes are necessary for state-funded investments, but they must be used wisely and not to fund terrorism or corruption. The Palestinian people deserve better than a leadership that is more focused on killing than building. It is also important to note that the Palestinian people have natural resources that can be used to build a successful state. However, corruption and a focus on terrorism have prevented them from utilizing these resources. The fact that the Palestinian Authority spends more than 5% of its budget on paying terrorists sitting in Israeli jails is a clear indication of their priorities. This money could be better spent on building a better life for the Palestinian people. The blame for the conflict cannot be solely placed on Israel. Palestinians radicalize with or without occupation. Radicalization is down to incitement and hate. If Palestinians are taught differently and the money that goes to terrorists via the Palestinian government went to helping Palestinians, there'd be no problems. The international community must also take responsibility for their role in perpetuating the conflict. The fact that the Palestinian people are the largest recipients of humanitarian aid per person over the past decade is a clear indication that aid money is not being used effectively. The international community must hold the Palestinian leadership accountable for their use of aid money and their support of terrorism. They must also recognize the deep-seated xenophobia and anti-Semitism that exists within Palestinian society and work to address it. In conclusion, the conflict between Israel and Palestine is not solely based on settlement and occupation. It has deep roots in Palestinian xenophobia and anti-Semitism that existed long before the arrival of European Jews. The Palestinian leadership must take responsibility for the radicalization of their people and the support of terrorism. The international community must hold them accountable and work to address the deep-seated hatred and xenophobia that exists within Palestinian society.
