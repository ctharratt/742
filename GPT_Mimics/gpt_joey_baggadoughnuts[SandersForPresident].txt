As a Bernie supporter, I have to say that I agree with some of the points made by my fellow Redditor. It's true that some white Bernie supporters can come across as condescending, and it's important to acknowledge that. However, I don't think it's fair to lump all white Bernie supporters together and make sweeping generalizations about us. The fact is, Bernie's message of economic justice and equality resonates with people of all races and backgrounds. Yes, there are some white Bernie supporters who may not fully understand the struggles of people of color, but that doesn't mean we don't care about those struggles or that we're not willing to listen and learn. I also take issue with the comparison to right-wingers and their treatment of black people. While there may be some similarities in terms of dismissing the concerns of marginalized groups, the motivations behind those actions are very different. Right-wingers often actively seek to oppress and marginalize people of color, while Bernie supporters are fighting for economic justice and equality for all. That being said, it's important for us as Bernie supporters to be aware of our privilege and to listen to the concerns of people of color. We need to be allies in the fight for racial justice, not just in words but in actions as well. As for the issue of private schools and the class divide, I couldn't agree more. The fact that children from wealthy families are often isolated from the rest of society and attend private schools with other wealthy children only perpetuates the class divide. We need to work towards a more equitable education system that gives all children, regardless of their background, the same opportunities to succeed. Moving on to other topics, I was glad to see the discussion about veterans in politics. As a veteran myself, I believe that we need more veterans in positions of power. Too often, politicians make decisions about war and foreign policy without truly understanding the consequences for the men and women who serve in the military. Having more veterans in politics would ensure that their voices are heard and their experiences are taken into account. I was also interested in the discussion about the economy and the unemployment rate. While it's true that the unemployment rate has gone down in recent years, there are still many people who are struggling to find work or who are underemployed. We need to focus on creating good-paying jobs and ensuring that everyone has access to the education and training they need to succeed in the workforce. Finally, I want to address the issue of campaign ads and spin. It's unfortunate that politics has become so focused on image and messaging rather than substance and policy. We need to hold our politicians accountable for their actions and their words, and not be swayed by slick ads or spin. In conclusion, while there may be some valid criticisms of white Bernie supporters, it's important to remember that we are all fighting for the same cause: economic justice and equality for all. We need to be allies in the fight for racial justice and work towards a more equitable society. We also need to focus on creating good-paying jobs and ensuring that everyone has access to the education and training they need to succeed. And finally, we need to hold our politicians accountable for their actions and their words, and not be swayed by slick ads or spin.
