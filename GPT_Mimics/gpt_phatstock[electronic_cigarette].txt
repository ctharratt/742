Hey there fellow vapers! I just wanted to chime in on the topic of e-juice and where to get the best flavors. I've been vaping for a few years now and have tried a ton of different juices from various vendors. I've found that some of the best juices come from smaller, lesser-known companies rather than the big names that everyone talks about. One of my favorite juice companies is Southern Steam. They have some of the most unique and delicious flavors I've ever tried. Their Bananas Foster is hands down the best version of that flavor I've ever had. It's my go-to juice for testing out new setups or just for an all-day vape. I also highly recommend their Peach Cobbler and Key Lime Pie flavors. They have a great balance of sweetness and tartness that is just perfect. Another great company is Vapor Chef. They have a huge selection of flavors and are always coming out with new ones. I love that they offer samples with every order so you can try out new flavors without committing to a full bottle. Their Honey Pearry and Hobbes' Blood flavors are some of my favorites. They also have a great dessert flavor called Butter Beer that tastes just like the drink from Harry Potter. Now, I know a lot of people swear by the big names like Five Pawns and Suicide Bunny, but I've found that their prices are just too steep for me. I'd rather support smaller companies that offer great flavors at a more reasonable price. Plus, I've found that some of the big names are just overhyped and don't live up to the hype. When it comes to buying juice, I prefer to order online rather than going to a local B&M. While it's nice to support local businesses, I've found that the prices are just too high and the selection is limited. Plus, ordering online allows me to try out new flavors from different companies without having to leave my house. Now, I know some people are hesitant to order juice online because they can't try it before they buy it. But that's where online reviews come in handy. There are tons of YouTube reviewers out there who do in-depth reviews of different juices and setups. I always check out reviews before ordering a new juice to make sure it's something I'll like. Speaking of setups, I've found that the right setup can really make a difference in the flavor of your juice. I started out with a basic ego battery and clearomizer, but have since upgraded to a mechanical mod and RDA. I've found that dripping allows me to really taste the flavors in my juice and get the most out of them. Plus, building coils is a fun hobby in itself. If you're new to vaping, I would recommend starting out with a basic setup like an ego battery and clearomizer. It's a great way to get started and figure out what flavors you like. But if you're looking to really get into vaping and try out different setups, I would highly recommend getting into dripping. It's a whole new world of flavor and vapor production. Now, I know there's been a lot of talk lately about the health benefits (or lack thereof) of vaping. As someone who has successfully quit smoking thanks to vaping, I can tell you that it has made a huge difference in my life. I no longer smell like smoke, I can breathe easier, and I don't have to worry about the health risks associated with smoking. But I also understand that there is still a lot we don't know about the long-term effects of vaping. That's why I think it's important for the vaping community to come together and support research into the safety and efficacy of vaping. We need to make sure that we're not just replacing one harmful habit with another. That being said, I think it's important to remember that vaping is still a harm reduction tool. It's not a perfect solution, but it's a lot better than smoking. And for those of us who have successfully quit smoking thanks to vaping, it's a lifesaver. In conclusion, I would encourage everyone to try out different juice companies and setups to find what works best for them. Don't be afraid to try new things and experiment with different flavors and setups. And most importantly, remember that vaping is a harm reduction tool that has helped countless people quit smoking and improve their health.
