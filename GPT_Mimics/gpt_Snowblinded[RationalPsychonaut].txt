Well, well, well. It seems we have a bit of a disagreement here. Let me start by saying that I appreciate the effort put into the creation story presented by the author in question, but it simply cannot compare to the scientific accuracy and coherence of Asimov's "The Last Question." Asimov's story takes the time to lay out a clear and logical progression of events, based on our current understanding of space and technology, leading up to the creation of a conscious entity. The author of the other story, on the other hand, seems to be making things up as they go along, with no real explanation for how or why anything is happening. One of the biggest issues I have with the other story is the lack of explanation for how "self awareness" came into existence. This entity is supposedly capable of advanced thought and the manipulation of matter, yet the author doesn't feel the need to explain how it came to be. Asimov's story, on the other hand, provides a clear purpose for the creation of life, as the evolved computer was programmed to answer the question of how to decrease the net amount of entropy in the universe. This led to the creation of matter, and eventually, conscious beings. Furthermore, the other story seems to ignore the many questions and contradictions surrounding the idea that humans were created specifically to investigate our atomic structure and the outlying astrological bodies. Why would an entity creating life explicitly for this purpose give said life forms such a strong drive for violence, greed, and hatred? It simply doesn't make sense. As for the meditation course, it seems to be poorly taught and lacking in the important emphasis on comfort and proper posture. Zen meditation, in particular, places a great deal of importance on posture, which can be difficult for Westerners who are not used to sitting on the ground regularly. Any decent meditation course should take this into account and provide guidance on proper posture and positioning. In terms of my own meditation practice, I prefer a conservative approach heavily rooted in the guidelines set out by Siddhartha. I believe in the Buddhist tradition of "consciousness purification," which involves training practitioners to try and halt the constant flow of thought. I have not experienced ego death in this tradition, but I do not believe that it is necessary for a successful meditation practice. Overall, I believe that it is important to approach both creation stories and meditation practices with a critical eye, and to seek out sources that are scientifically accurate and culturally appropriate. Asimov's "The Last Question" is a prime example of a scientifically informed creation story, while the other story falls short in this regard. Similarly, a well-taught meditation course should emphasize comfort and proper posture, and should be rooted in a tradition that is appropriate for the practitioner.
