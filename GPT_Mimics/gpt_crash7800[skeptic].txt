Ok cool, let's dive into these topics. First up, the Monsanto PR campaign. It's hard to follow what's going on in this clip, but from what I gather, Monsanto is trying to develop food that will help people. However, their public image has been so jacked up with misinformation that they're running a blatant PR campaign to convince people to stop being dumb enough to serve their own self-interest. But here's the twist: the lettuce, peppers, and broccoli, plus a melon and an onion, with a watermelon soon to follow, aren't genetically modified at all. Monsanto created all these veggies using good old-fashioned crossbreeding, the same technology that farmers have been using to optimize crops for millennia. That doesn't mean they are low tech, exactly. Stark's division is drawing on Monsanto's accumulated scientific know-how to create vegetables that have all the advantages of genetically modified organisms without any of the Frankenfoods ick factor. As someone who works in marketing, it's good to know that the pursuit of using subtle differences in syntax in order to convince people of things is being used to benefit mankind. Forget stopping the flow of refugees of people out of Syria. There are millions of people who have fled into Europe. The goal is to make people view these people as potentially violent threats. To further destabilize these countries through fear and conflict. If you're not going to even read what I write, I'm done here. Moving on to the Microsoft data verification issue. By invoking the need for a third party to verify the data, they are implying that Microsoft cannot be trusted. And if Microsoft cannot be trusted, then their cooperation with a third party cannot be trusted. I am not saying that I believe this. What I am saying is that the people who believe in conspiracies will never be satisfied, so it's moot. You'll never be able to truly prove this - it's akin to proving a negative. As you'd see over on /r/conspiracy, as soon as a third party verifies that Microsoft is not selling personal data or that they are not sending it to the government, someone would just accuse the third party of being a shill. Ultimately, I don't think that crash/performance data that is non-personal is a big deal. But it's up to everyone else what their preferences are. Now, let's talk about Spirit Science and Infowars. Much like many people who are religious have not read their respective religious texts cover-to-cover, many people who interact or even support groups like Spirit Science or Infowars do not know the full scope. They just like the brand, high level concept, or some of the ideas. Millions, even in the tens of millions, of fans on a social network can mean nothing. For a relatively low price, you can buy fans, the huge majority of which are fake. But having these huge numbers are a great way to combine the impressionable minority that they are relevant and, in turn, worthwhile. Push comes to shove, look at the numbers. Views on YouTube videos (which are harder but not impossible to fudge) and actual conversations around these topics. These are niche interests and beliefs. The video in question has less than 10k views. This is nothing. Yes, people share messages from Spirit Science about how yoga makes you feel good. But you'll notice that not many people engage with the quasi-anti-Semitic or other bizarre crap. Moving on to the Chinese face reading system. I think this system is so obscure in the western world that it's hard to find good explanations. From what I've seen, there are all these Asian gurus selling their seminars and courses for big bucks. The biggest of them all has more than half a million Facebook fans and a bunch of books on Amazon that try to upsell his courses or more books. If the concept works, it can be reduced to principles. This is not being done here. At all. Finally, let's talk about the personality assessment. If a full profile, which is the most time-consuming, gives the worst results, then this is a major red flag. The more time invested and the more closely he looks, the more accurate he should get. Is this sinking in yet? My friend said that it would've been better if you married this year. And that you are yet young and your aspirations in medicine would come later, after the age of 35. Ah, no. Between our former lease, buying a house, family obligations, etc. getting married this year would have been a nightmare. At any rate, this is called moving the goalpost. Also, notice that he does not give a full assessment of either of us. He talks about my professional life (which is so vague that he literally can't be wrong) and my wife's personality. Where's the stuff about my personality? Where's the stuff about my wife's professional life? I'm just a consumer. In conclusion, these topics are all over the place, but they all have one thing in common: they are all about perception. Whether it's about the perception of a company, a conspiracy theory, a personality assessment, or a Chinese face reading system, it all comes down to how people perceive things. And as someone who works in marketing, I can tell you that perception is everything. It's what makes people buy things, believe things, and do things. So, if you want to be successful in life, you need to understand how perception works. And that's my two cents.
