The Blacklist has been a show that has kept its audience on the edge of their seats since its inception. The show has been a rollercoaster ride of emotions, with twists and turns that have left viewers guessing at every turn. One of the biggest mysteries of the show has been the true identity of Raymond Reddington. Is he really the father of Elizabeth Keen? Or is he an imposter who has taken on the identity of the real Raymond Reddington? The show has given us some clues over the years, but it has also left us with more questions than answers. One of the biggest questions that has been on the minds of fans is the timing of things. What triggered Red to come back at that moment? Why did he choose that particular time to turn himself in to the FBI? I believe that the cabal likes to play a long game when setting up their pawns/enemies. Red had been "burned" or manipulated for a while before they moved in on him. Whether or not Red is her bio-father, I think he was the man she knew as "daddy" the day of the fire. The argument in Lizzie's memory is a key piece of evidence that supports this theory. First, the father named Lizzie Elizabeth and rejected the Masha her mother called her. If Red had come with her mother to help her search the house, I would think he would have kept the name her mother had given her instead of the name the father gave. Second, there's an exchange where father says, "you're not here for her." And mother says, "listen, you're in trouble." Father, "Because of you." Mother, "Yes." F, "You told them." M, "Yes, I told them." It was the father's home they came to. To grab Masha, get the Fulcrum, warn the father and go. If Red was one of Katerina's goonies that night, even if he loved her, he had no reason to find the Fulcrum to go after the cabal if it was Katerina who sicced the cabal on the father; it doesn't make sense. But, if he were the father, then it makes more sense. Third, the father saying the Fulcrum is the only thing keeping him alive. Combined with the mother saying her job was to spy on him, but she tried to protect him because she loved him because "they" will kill him if he doesn't give "it" back, makes me wonder about the intricacies in the relationships of covert operatives. Was Katerina a Russian spy? An American double agent? Either of those, conscripted by the cabal? The woman wasn't Katerina! The woman was Naomi! It makes so much more sense! The height charts on the doorway of the house Red burned down stop at three... the transcript implies he took her from the woman... But, the woman seems more intent on finding the Fulcrum in the house, not the child. Saving Red's life is number one, not getting her "daughter" back... It explains how Naomi knew of Liz, but didn't feel particularly protective or maternal over her like she did for Jennifer... Also, the way the woman waffles when Red confronts her about "protecting" him... a KGB agent wouldn't be a milquetoast... And when Red grabs at her, a spy wouldn't shriek and whimper, she'd kick his ass... the woman calls him Raymond at the end, and so did Naomi... And, it completely and perfectly parallels what the cabal did to Cooper and Red's empathy/commiseration to Cooper's predicament. It also explains how Lizzie ended up in foster care. The men who came in with Naomi ended up forcing them into hiding (were they actually in WitSec, or did they just disappear). They were probably the ones to set fire to the house to cover up their tracks. If Naomi thought she had killed Raymond and almost killed Lizzie in the process--and if four-year-old Lizzie feared Naomi because of all the scariness that went down--and if Naomi felt a great, heaping pile of resentment toward Lizzie as being the catalyst for the entire mess, she may not have wanted her to "disappear" with her and Jennifer and may have not looked too closely at where Liz would have ended up. That's if she even had a choice, if the cabal wanted Lizzie to be separated from what she knew. When Red is talking to her about where the fulcrum is, she's walking down the hall towards the argument and Red tells her "You don't want to see this Lizzie." Which means she did see "it" as a child, or it wouldn't be there for her to remember. And Red was there too or he wouldn't know to tell her to turn around. The woman is screaming, "Stop! Get away!" as Red is telling Lizzie that she doesn't want to go in there. Little Lizzie screams and there's a gunshot. I think she saw Red shot by the cabal goons after they had started the fire. The best way to get rid of evidence is to burn it, right? Naomi or Katerina or whoever the woman was had been duped, leading them to Raymond. If the Fulcrum is in the house, it's gone. If it's not, the only person who knows about it is dead, and if the kid is in there, oh, well... Collateral damage--the daughter of a KGB agent, anyway. In conclusion, The Blacklist has been a show that has kept its audience guessing at every turn.
