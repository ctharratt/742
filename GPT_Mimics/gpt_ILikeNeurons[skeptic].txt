Climate Change and the Need for a Carbon Tax Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today. The scientific consensus is clear: human activity is responsible for global warming, and failing to mitigate climate change will have devastating consequences for our planet. The economic costs of inaction are also significant, with conservative estimates suggesting that it could cost us 10% of GDP over 50 years. In contrast, a carbon tax may actually boost GDP, if the revenue is used to offset other taxes or returned as an equitable dividend. Bjorn Lomborg's work was ruled scientifically dishonest by an independent panel, but he himself was not found guilty due to his lack of expertise in the fields in question. However, the need for a carbon tax is supported by a consensus among economists, similar to the consensus among climatologists that human activity is responsible for global warming. A carbon tax is a simple and effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By putting the price "upstream" where the fossil fuels enter the market, it is easily enforceable and bureaucratically lean. Returning the revenue as an equitable dividend offsets the regressive effects of the tax, with around 60% of the public receiving more in dividend than they paid in taxes. Enacting a border tax would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also incentivize those countries to enact their own carbon tax. The IPCC (AR5, WGIII) Summary for Policymakers states with "high confidence" that tax-based policies are effective at decoupling GHG emissions from GDP. Ch. 15 of the full report has a more complete discussion. According to the IMF, subsidies for fossil fuels, which include direct cash transfers, tax breaks, and free pollution rights, cost the world $5.3 trillion/yr. "Energy pricing reform is largely in countriesâ€™ own domestic interest and therefore is beneficial even in the absence of globally coordinated action." The need for a carbon tax is clear, and the longer we wait to take action, the more expensive it will be. It is not smart to ignore this simple action that could have a significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. When it comes to science, we can choose to be knowledgeable or ignorant. Scientific skeptics require claims to be supported by empirical evidence before believing them. It's not about "government good" or "government bad," but whether or not something is supported by science. In economics, there is a surprising degree of consensus on many topics, as the evidence shows. The consensus seems to follow the strength of the evidence, and there happens to be more evidence for micro than macro economics. It's important to be able to draw a distinction between a fact and an opinion. The skeptic community should engage in critical thinking and not alienate entire groups of people who could be potential allies. Richard Dawkins, for example, makes some people embarrassed to call themselves skeptics. He drives people away unnecessarily, when the skeptics community is trying to grow. It's counter-productive. Feminism is often a topic of debate within the skeptic community. The old definition of feminism no longer applies to feminism, and it isn't about equality, but maintaining the oppression narrative. Western women are probably the most privileged demographic on the entire planet. If feminism was about equality, they'd be working on men's issues right now, because by every metric men are doing worse than women are in the west. However, 85% of people believe in "equality for women," according to a recent survey. In conclusion, climate change is a pressing issue that requires action. A carbon tax is a simple and effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The need for a carbon tax is supported by a consensus among economists, similar to the consensus among climatologists that human activity is responsible for global warming. The skeptic community should engage in critical thinking and not alienate potential allies.
