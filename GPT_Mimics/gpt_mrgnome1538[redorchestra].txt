Alright, let's talk about the game that we all love - Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm. Specifically, let's talk about some of the strategies and tactics that we can use to dominate the battlefield. First off, let's talk about the groups of 5 that run straight standing up. This is a common tactic that we see on every map, and it can be incredibly effective if executed properly. The key is to stay in a tight formation and move quickly, so that you can catch the enemy off guard and take them out before they have a chance to react. Of course, you should never crouch sprint - this will only slow you down and make you an easy target. Now, if you're looking to rack up kills quickly, there's no better strategy than laying prone and sniping at the enemy spawn. This can be especially effective if you have a semi-auto rifle, as you can fire off shots quickly and take out multiple enemies in rapid succession. Of course, there is one downside to this strategy - if someone dies on top of you or in front of you, their body won't disappear, which means you'll have to risk moving and exposing yourself to the enemy. It's a small price to pay for all those kills, though. Speaking of games that we love, let's talk about Darkest Hour. This game was an absolute blast back in its heyday, but unfortunately, its hype train left the station many moons ago. Fortunately, we now have a Heroes of the West mod for RO2/RS, which I think is a very suitable replacement. With the active player base of RO2/RS, there's a great deal of potential for the mod. Unfortunately, at the moment, HotW hasn't received a lot of attention, but its small dedicated community is growing slowly, and their map makers are churning out some great content. If we can shift the community to that, we'd all have a good time! Now, let's talk about some specific positions and loadouts that can be effective in certain situations. For example, if you're attacking, one of the best positions to be in is behind a rock with a BAR, 30 Cal, or Springfield. I've managed to get 25+ kills just laying behind that rock. Of course, you'll need to be careful not to expose yourself too much, but if you play it right, you can be a real force to be reckoned with. When it comes to loadouts, it's important to remember that some classes are better suited for experienced players. New players in this game typically start as a rifleman/assault in order to learn the mechanics of the game and the flow of the battle. Once you understand these things and start to do exceptionally well with these classes, then you would be well suited for other more complicated roles. One thing that I've always been hesitant to do is use force respawn. It's always been something tricky for me, and I usually never did use it. However, after reading some tips and tricks from other players, I now feel more confident in using it. It's a small thing, but it can make a big difference in the heat of battle. Now, let's talk about some other games that we love. Company of Heroes is one of the highest rated RTS games of all time for computer. CoH1 and CoH2 are both WWII, top-down real-time strategy games. There's a solo campaign for both games, but they mostly focus on 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 online matches for PvP. There's a big learning curve, but once you get over it, the game gets intense and mentally challenging. It's amazing, and it's my favorite RTS of all time. Of course, when it comes to games that we love, nothing beats the immersion factor of Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm. I get sucked into the game every time I play, and I'm sure many of you feel the same way. Whether you're playing as a sniper, a rifleman, or a machine gunner, there's nothing quite like the feeling of taking out an enemy soldier and knowing that you've made a difference in the battle. Now, let's talk about some of the finer points of gameplay. For example, did you know that every weapon in the game will have their full magazine +1 round because each weapon will start with 1 in the chamber? This fact is crucial when counting bullets as a sniper or a rifleman. If you don't count and time your reloads appropriately, you often will immediately get shot. Another important thing to remember is that manual bolting can be incredibly helpful for veterans. Depending on the distance to your target and your weapon, you can save half a plane length by manually bolting instead of using the automatic bolt. It takes some practice to get the timing right, but once you do, it can be a game-changer. Of course, there are always some challenges that we face when playing Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm. For example, many people view the Russians as the underdogs, which leads to two things: people avoid them and stack axis first, and veterans know this and prey on the noobs who get stuck on allies. However, as you rank up and begin to level the weapons and gain access to Axis loadouts, things start to level out. Finally, let's talk about some of the technical issues that we sometimes face when playing Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm. For example, it can be frustrating to join servers that "lie" about their player/bot count. It's also common to join a server in the middle of it switching maps, so you may see one map on the server list but as you load in, it's a different map. These are small issues, but they can be annoying nonetheless. In conclusion, Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm is an amazing game that we all love. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a new player just starting out, there's always something new to learn and discover. So get out there, join a server, and start dominating the battlefield!
