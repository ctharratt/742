I love a good challenge, and when it comes to home decor, there's nothing more challenging than making a small space feel cozy and functional. That's why I was excited to see this studio apartment that a college student was looking to decorate. With a little creativity and some smart design choices, I knew we could turn this space into a comfortable and stylish home. First things first, let's talk about the kitchen. Or, rather, let's talk about how we can de-kitchenize it. The stove is taking up valuable space and making the room feel more like a kitchen than a bedroom. So, my first suggestion would be to remove it and replace it with a tall wardrobe. This will not only free up space but also give you a place to hang your clothes and store your folded items. Speaking of storage, the nearby cabinets can be used to store your folded clothes. If you're not sure how to organize your clothes, I highly recommend checking out the Konmari method. It's a great way to declutter and organize your belongings. Now, let's talk about the sink. Instead of using it as a kitchen sink, we can turn it into a wet bar. Add a mirror above it and some glass shelves, and you've got yourself a stylish and functional wet bar. This will also help to de-kitchenize the space. To further de-kitchenize the room, we can use the top of the cabinets as a bookshelf. This will add some personality to the space and make it feel less like a kitchen. Next, let's talk about the flooring. The tile is great for a kitchen but not so much for a bedroom. To make the room feel more cozy, I suggest adding a rug. A nice rug will not only add some warmth to the space but also help to de-kitchenize it. Now, let's talk about the bed. It's currently centered on the window, which makes it feel more like a dinette set than a bedroom. To fix this, we can move the bed to the center of the room. This will make it feel more like a bedroom and less like a kitchen. To add some drama to the space, I suggest adding full, floor-to-ceiling drapes behind the bed. This will make the room feel more luxurious and less like a studio apartment. Now, let's talk about plants. Adding plants to the space will not only make it feel more alive but also help to fill in any dead space. I suggest adding a tall plant to the right of the bed to fill in that empty space. If you're not sure what to do with the space to the right of the bed, there are a few options. You could use it as a coat rack, mount a TV in that corner, or put a desk in there for your workstation. The possibilities are endless. Now, let's talk about lighting. Overhead lighting is great for a kitchen but not so much for a bedroom. Instead, I suggest adding under-cabinet lighting to the kitchen. This will provide some low mood lighting that's perfect for a bedroom. You could also add strip lighting above the cabinets for some extra ambiance. For inspiration, consider studio hotel rooms that often include a kitchenette. These rooms often have similar cabinetry along one wall and facing the bed. To add to the hotel experience, I suggest adding a Keurig machine near the wet bar. Now, let's talk about the windows. Blackout blinds are a must for any bedroom, especially if you're a light sleeper. I suggest checking out JC Penny for some affordable options. You could also consider top-down/bottom-up shades, which will allow you to keep the top half of the window open while still blocking out the view of your neighbor. Now, let's move on to the living room. The sectional looks very comfy, but the room is lacking a focal point. I suggest making the wall dividing the living and kitchen areas the focal point. You could paint it a dramatic accent color and add some bar stools there. Then, put your sofa on the wall facing the kitchen and invest in two club chairs to face the sofa. To add some personality to the space, I suggest adding a rug. A rug will not only add some color and pattern to the room but also help to define the living area. Now, let's talk about the console. It's currently too small for the TV, which makes the room feel unbalanced. I suggest getting a longer console to balance out the space. Flank it with tall plants to camouflage your speakers. I'm not a fan of vertical blinds, as they remind me of the 90s. Instead, I suggest adding full-length drapes. This will add some softness to the space and help to block out any unwanted light. Now, let's talk about the ottoman. I suggest adding a tray to the top of it to display magazines or hold your drinks. This will also break up the expanse of endless medium brown cushions. Finally, let's talk about the decor. The birdcage is a bit out of place in a bedroom, so I suggest moving it elsewhere. You could put it on the wall above the plant in the living room or above the toilet in the bathroom. Your next acquisition should be a rug that will introduce some color and pattern into the room. This will set you on a direction for throw pillows, throw rugs, and art that marries with the colors in the rug. In conclusion, with a little creativity and some smart design choices, you can turn a small studio apartment into a comfortable and stylish home. De-kitchenize the space, add some plants, and invest in some low mood lighting. Make the wall dividing the living and kitchen areas the focal point and add a rug to define the living area. With these tips, you'll have a cozy and functional space that you'll love coming home to.
