Now, listen up folks. I don't ask for much, but I'm going to need you to start doing some things for me. And I don't want to hear any questions. Just do it. Some of it might be hard, some of it might be long, but that's just the way it is. It's all about genetics, God's control, you know what I mean? Now, let me tell you about the magic of fisting. Wait, hold on. That's not what I meant to say. I got sidetracked there for a second. My bad. What I really want to talk about is the military. See, I've been seeing a lot of talk lately about how the military is all about enforcing minutiae and how they're so zealous about it. And let me tell you, as someone who served for almost six years, that's absolutely true. The military is all about the little things. They'll reprimand you for having unauthorized hair styling, for not wearing the right uniform, for not standing at attention properly. It's all about discipline and following orders. But here's the thing. It's not just the military. It's everywhere. It's in every job, every organization, every aspect of life. People love to tell other people what to do. They love to exert their power and control over others. And it's not just the people in charge. It's everyone. We all do it. We all want to feel important, to feel like we have some say in the world. And that's where the problem lies. We're so focused on the little things, on the minutiae, that we forget about the big picture. We forget about the things that really matter. We forget about the people. I remember when I was in the Air Force, there was a female SSGT who had unauthorized hair styling. She got stopped daily by NCOs and officers who reprimanded her for it. And she also had a daughter who she passed it onto, too. But here's the thing. She was a damn good airman. She did her job well, she was respected by her peers, and she was a good mother. But all anyone could focus on was her hair. And that's just one example. There are countless others. People get so caught up in the little things that they forget about the big picture. They forget about the people behind the rules and regulations. But it's not just about the military or the workplace. It's about society as a whole. We're so quick to judge others, to make assumptions about them based on their appearance or their background. We're so quick to label people as "good" or "bad" based on the little things, without ever taking the time to get to know them as individuals. And that's where the real problem lies. We're so focused on the little things that we forget about the humanity behind them. We forget that everyone has a story, everyone has struggles and triumphs, everyone has something to offer. So, what can we do about it? How can we shift our focus from the minutiae to the bigger picture? Well, it starts with us. It starts with each and every one of us taking a step back and looking at the world around us. It starts with us recognizing that the little things are important, but they're not everything. It starts with us seeing the humanity in others, even when it's hard. And it's not just about seeing the humanity in others. It's about seeing the humanity in ourselves, too. It's about recognizing that we're all flawed, that we all make mistakes, that we all have room to grow. It's about being kind to ourselves and to others, even when it's hard. I know it's not easy. I know it's hard to shift our focus from the little things to the bigger picture. But it's worth it. It's worth it to see the world in a different way, to see the humanity in others, to see the potential for growth and change. So, let's do it. Let's shift our focus from the minutiae to the bigger picture. Let's see the humanity in others and in ourselves. Let's be kind, even when it's hard. And let's make the world a better place, one step at a time.
