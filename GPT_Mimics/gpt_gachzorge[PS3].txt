When it comes to old games and systems, there's something special about revisiting them. Maybe it's the nostalgia factor, or maybe it's the fact that these games were made in a different era of gaming. Whatever the reason, there's no denying that there are some classic games out there that are worth playing again. One system that has always had great exclusives is the Playstation. If you're looking for single player experiences, then the PS3 and PS4 are both great options. The Metal Gear Solid series is a must-play for any fan of the stealth genre. I highly recommend playing through all four games in order, as each one builds upon the previous one. The PS3 is the only system that can play MGS4, and it is one of my favorite games of all time. The story is complex and engaging, and the gameplay is top-notch. If you're a fan of the series, then you owe it to yourself to play this game. Another great exclusive for the PS3 is the ICO/SotC remastered collection. If you never played these games on the PS2, then you're in for a treat. Shadow of the Colossus is still my favorite game of all time, and the remastered version looks and plays great. The Last Guardian, the spiritual successor to these games, is finally coming out soon, so it's a great time to revisit these classics. The Uncharted and The Last of Us series are also great exclusives, but they have been remastered for the PS4. If you already own a PS4, then I would recommend getting the remastered versions. However, if you only have a PS3, then these games are still worth playing. If you missed out on any third party games, then now is the time to pick them up. Red Dead Redemption is a must-play for any fan of open-world games. The story is engaging, the characters are memorable, and the gameplay is fun. It's a shame that there hasn't been a sequel yet, but maybe one day we'll get one. If you're on a budget, then I highly recommend subscribing to Playstation Plus. You'll get access to a ton of free games each month, and some of them are really great. I've discovered some hidden gems through this service, and it's a great way to try out games that you might not have otherwise played. I've had my PS3 since 2007, and I've spent a few extra hundred dollars trying to keep it alive over the years. I paid $600 for the fat version that still played PS2 games, and I don't regret it. There are still a ton of games that I haven't played, but I'm ready to make the move over to the PS4. I might be able to get one by the time MGSV comes out, and that would be the game that would push me to do it. Nothing else thus far is as enticing. If you're looking for online TPS games, then I highly recommend Warhawk. It's an old game, but it's still a lot of fun. The Last of Us also has a great multiplayer mode, but it can be a bit gory for some people. If you're having issues with your PS3, then there are a few things that you can try before sending it in for repairs. Cleaning the dust out of the system can help with overheating issues, and replacing the thermal paste can help with cooling. If you're not comfortable doing these things yourself, then it's probably best to send it in for repairs. When it comes to gaming, everyone has their own preferences. Some people love FPS games, while others prefer puzzle games. For me, Shadow of the Colossus is still my favorite game of all time. It's a puzzle game at heart, but it's also an epic adventure. The sense of scale and wonder that you get from fighting these giant creatures is unmatched in any other game. Metal Gear Solid 4 is also one of my favorite games of all time. The story is complex and engaging, and the gameplay is top-notch. It's a game that rewards patience and strategy, and it's a must-play for any fan of the series. Journey is another game that I really enjoyed. It's a short game, but it's a beautiful experience. The lack of dialogue allows you to interpret the story in your own way, and the multiplayer aspect is unique and engaging. Overall, there are a ton of great games out there for the PS3 and PS4. Whether you're looking for single player experiences or online multiplayer, there's something for everyone. If you're on a budget, then subscribing to Playstation Plus is a great way to discover new games. And if you're a fan of classic games, then revisiting them on an old system can be a great way to relive some memories.
