When it comes to shaving, there are a lot of different techniques and products out there. As someone who has been experimenting with different methods for a while now, I've found that going against the grain is the best way to get a smooth shave without any issues. Of course, this can vary depending on your skin type and hair growth patterns, so it's important to find what works best for you. One thing that I always recommend is moisturizing and exfoliating before shaving. This can help to prevent irritation and ingrown hairs, and it also makes for a smoother shave overall. I like to exfoliate in the shower and then moisturize afterwards, using coconut oil as my go-to moisturizer. I also like to put conditioner on the hairs before exfoliating, leaving it there until I'm ready to start shaving. Of course, I'm not the most experienced shaver out there, and there are plenty of people who have been doing this for much longer than I have. But I think that my first setup was pretty decent, and I've been able to upgrade it over time. I started out with a basic kit that included a razor, some soap, and a brush, and I've since added more products to my collection. One thing that I've noticed is that there are a lot of different types of soap and cream out there, and everyone seems to have their own preferences. Personally, I like both soap and cream, but I think that cream is a bit easier to work with. As for my starting kit, I don't remember exactly how much it cost, but I think it was around $50 or so. I've also been keeping a list of all the different soaps and brushes that I've tried over the years. It's a pretty long list at this point, and I'm always adding to it. I think that it's important to keep track of what works and what doesn't, so that you can make informed decisions when it comes to buying new products. One thing that I've noticed is that there are a lot of different types of razors out there, and they all have their own pros and cons. I've tried both modern and vintage razors, and I think that they both have their own unique benefits. For example, I recently switched from a modern Merkur razor to a vintage Super Adjustable, and I've noticed a huge difference in the quality of my shaves. Another thing that I've learned is that the products you use can have a big impact on the quality of your shave. For example, if you're using coconut oil as a pre-shave oil, it might be messing with your lather if you're lathering directly on your legs. I've also found that using a shaving brush and soap can help to hold moisture in and prevent irritation. When it comes to choosing a brush, there are a lot of different factors to consider. Personally, I prefer custom brushes and have only used lower-end mass-produced brushes in the past. If you're looking for a new brush, I would recommend looking for one with a larger knot, as this tends to work better for me. In terms of aftershave products, I've found that lotion bars work really well. They're kind of like MLS pre-shave butters, but more solid and in stick form. I also really like Dapper Dragon's scents, especially the orange and white chocolate, lavender, sakura, and festival scents. Of course, everyone's skin is different, and what works for one person might not work for another. That's why it's important to experiment with different products and techniques until you find what works best for you. For example, I've found that my SE Gem razor is the best for me, as it doesn't clog with hairs the way most razors do. When it comes to actually shaving, there are a few things to keep in mind. For example, it's important to map the grain of your hair and shave with or against the grain depending on your skin type and hair growth patterns. You should also stretch your skin if you need to, and be careful not to nick yourself. Overall, I think that shaving is a really personal thing, and everyone has their own preferences and techniques. But by experimenting with different products and techniques, you can find what works best for you and get the smoothest, most comfortable shave possible.
