As a developer for iHeart, I have experienced my fair share of issues with various technologies. One issue that I have been going back and forth with a developer about is the integration of Cortana onto Xbox One. While it was supposed to come with last year's NXOE update, it seems that it will be arriving early this year instead.  One of the biggest criticisms of Windows phones is the lack of apps available. As someone who uses both iOS and Android, I can understand why people would question the point of buying a Windows phone. However, if the app issue were to be solved, then that negative would go away. Unfortunately, Windows phones do not have the market share to lose, so it is unlikely that developers will prioritize creating apps for the platform.  I recently came across an interesting potential future for Continuum. It seems that some states are dominated by faceless factions in certain games, which can be discouraging for new players. However, if Continuum were to be used to block new people from joining factions in cases like this, it could create a more level playing field.  Another interesting topic that I have been exploring is the use of virtual desktops. While some people may be hesitant to use them, I have found that they can be quite useful. For example, I use a virtual desktop for work and have found that it works well as long as I have a good wifi connection.  One issue that I have been discussing with others is the use of glance screens on different types of screens. For IPS LCD screens, it does not matter whether the screen is black or not, as lighting the pixels causes battery drain. However, for AMOLED screens, only the necessary pixels are lit, which means that blacks are much darker and battery life is improved.  I have also been discussing the app craze and whether it will die off in the next few years. While it is annoying that every site seems to think they need an app, I believe that HTML 5 notifications will become more common and eventually replace the need for apps.  In terms of messaging and Skype improvements, I am excited about the ability to attach photos to Skype messages. I have also found that Realarm is a great app for setting alarms and have not had any issues with it since I started using it.  One topic that has been debated is the handling of notifications on different platforms. While some people prefer the way that Android handles notifications, I believe that Windows phones do it better. With Windows phones, you have more control over notifications, including the ability to turn them on/off, keep them private on the lock screen, and control the notification sound.  Overall, there are many interesting topics to explore in the world of technology. While some issues may seem minor, they can have a big impact on how we use our devices. As a developer, it is important to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies in order to create the best possible user experience.
