I can't believe the audacity of some people. Do they write anything but their own self-righteous drivel? It's almost like they're trying to indoctrinate us with their narrow-minded views. Well, I won't stand for it. Have a downvote, you sanctimonious prick. And don't even get me started on religion. It's all just a bunch of paradoxical and fallacious bullshit. Nice penmanship though, I'll give you that. But seriously, why waste your time with that nonsense? Even free time needs planning, and wasting it on something as pointless as religion is just plain regrettable. Speaking of wasting time, why the fuck did you even bother replying to me? I had a terrible day and cancelled all my appointments because of it. Now what am I supposed to do? Go ahead and post your humblebrag bullshit, I don't even care. That's my 'hood, yo. And don't even get me started on handwriting. I mean, who the hell uses Rhodia for everyday scribbling? That shit's expensive and wasteful. Good quality paper is just as important as a good pen and hand, but if it's too absorbent or scratches easily, it's no good. And don't even get me started on those who think they're experts on the subject. What are your credentials, huh? I doubt you even know the first thing about it. But let's move on to a more serious topic. Mental illness. It's not my area of expertise, but I can tell you one thing – it's not an illness. Illnesses have symptoms, whereas mental illness is just a bunch of symptoms that are treated as the illness itself. And what do they do? They treat it with drugs and psychotherapy to try and suppress the symptoms. But they never find the root cause of the problem. It could be an anomaly with the DNA, an overproduction of a hormone by a gland, a slight chemical imbalance caused by a deficiency, etc. But they're not able to pinpoint it. And until they do, they'll never find the cure for the disease itself. And don't even get me started on religion and its role in mental illness. It's a nasty, short-sighted, terrible influence on people's lives. Just look at the Catholic practice of Confession. It's not meant to be for people to be absolved, but it is how they absolve themselves. If people forgive themselves, they no longer feel the need to take steps to truly repent. And that just removes all responsibility from the individual. No wonder religion is steeped in violence. But let's move on to a more lighthearted topic – Shakespearean sonnets. Love the ink, love the penmanship. But really don't like the passages. Lots of child molestation references. And let's face it, you were probably a fat ugly little motherfucker, weren't you? Nobody wanted to molest you. You're like a turd that stayed in too long, black, diseased looking and painful. And don't even get me started on your gene pool diluting presence. Just kill yourself already and rid us of your stupidity. And don't even get me started on the topic of feminism. It's just a bunch of bullshit made up by women who can't handle the fact that they're not as good as men. And if you call them out on it, they'll just call you a misogynist. But what about all the real issues facing women in the world? Parents killing their female babies, genital mutilation and honor killings and organized rape. I wonder what these feminists would call that? Probably just another excuse to play the victim. In conclusion, people need to stop wasting their time with pointless things like religion and mental illness. And don't even get me started on feminism. It's time to focus on real issues facing the world today. And if you disagree with me, well then you're just a foolish fuck who doesn't know what they're talking about.
