Okay, so let me just start by saying that I'm not a pedophile. I mean, sure, when I was like 12 or 13, I realized I was gay and I was attracted to 6-9 year olds. But that doesn't make me a pedophile, right? I mean, I was also attracted to boys my own age, so it's not like I only had a thing for little kids. And I didn't think I was a pedophile at the time, just gay. It's not like I was out there trying to molest children or anything. But yeah, I was definitely excited by seeing 6-9 year olds. I don't know why, it's just how I felt. But as I got older, my age of attraction changed too. By the time I was in high school, I wasn't attracted to 6-9 year olds anymore. Instead, I was into middle school age boys, like 10-13 year olds who were going through puberty. And yeah, I would occasionally find a young looking 14 year old attractive too. I remember when I was in high school, I used to love looking at the new freshman boys when they came in. They were so cute and innocent, you know? But then as I got older, my attraction shifted again. In my sophomore year of college, I found myself being attracted to 14-16 year olds. And in my mid 20s, I was into 18-22 year olds. Now that I'm in my late 20s, I'm finally attracted to people my own age, like 21-31 year olds. But here's the thing, sometimes I still find myself eyeing a good looking 15 or 16 year old. It's not like I have any emotional connection to them or anything, it's just a physical attraction. And I know that's not okay, but I can't help how I feel. Now, I know there isn't any evidence to suggest that early childhood sex or something makes someone more likely to be a pedophile. And I don't believe that either. I think you're born a pedophile, just like how you're born gay, straight, or bi. But I also think that sometimes your sexual development can just stop at a certain age for some reason. For example, when I was 6, 7, or 8 years old, I was attracted to other kids my age. But as I got older, my age of attraction changed. And I think that's just a natural part of growing up and discovering your sexuality. Now, I'm not saying that being attracted to young children is okay. It's not. But I don't think it necessarily makes you a pedophile either. And I definitely don't think that being molested as a child makes you a pedophile. That's just not how it works. As for the whole feeder thing, I'm assuming that means you like fat people? Or maybe you like eating while you're having sex? I don't know, man. And I'm not even sure what you mean by video sexting with a "girl" who was really an adult man. That's just messed up. But I do remember when I was 14 or 13, I got my own computer and I was discovering my sexuality. I realized I was gay and I started looking for other hot boys online. But all I could find were 20-something year old twinks, and that didn't really do it for me. So I started using Kazaa to try and find naked pics of boys my own age. And I did find some illegal photos, but I thought they were other kids like me sharing photos of each other. Now I know that was probably their dad, uncle, or babysitter coaxing them to do it and then photographing them. But at the time, I didn't know any better. And I thought if these "boys" were sharing their photos with me, why not return the favor? I didn't think it was a big deal. But now I know better. And no, I don't have those photos anymore. I got rid of that computer a long time ago. And I'm not even attracted to kids anymore, just guys my own age. But if those photos were to get posted on any gay video or photo sites now, they would definitely be taken down for child porn. But honestly, I don't really care. If someone recognizes me from those photos, that says more about them than it does about me. And besides, those photos were from 2002. The quality was terrible and they were saved on a floppy disk, for crying out loud. I'm sure if a pedo wants photos of naked kids, they can get their hands on better quality stuff now. But that's not my problem. I'm just trying to live my life and figure out my sexuality like everyone else.
