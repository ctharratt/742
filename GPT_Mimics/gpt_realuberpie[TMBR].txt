What the hell is going on with the internet these days? I mean, seriously, have you seen some of the stuff that's out there? It's like people have lost their damn minds. And don't even get me started on the influence it has on young people. I'm not saying that all young people are bad, but some of them are just downright messed up. And it's all because of the internet. Take that girl in my class, for example. She's got some seriously messed up views, and I'm pretty sure it's all because of the internet. I mean, without it, she wouldn't have access to all the crazy stuff she's into. And she's not the only one. There are plenty of people out there who have been influenced by the internet in all the wrong ways. And it's not just young people, either. There are plenty of adults out there who have been sucked into the internet's dark side. They spend all their time on social media, arguing with strangers and spreading hate. It's like they've forgotten how to interact with people in the real world. But it's not just the negative influence that's the problem. It's also the fact that the internet has made everything so damn accessible. I mean, back in the day, if you wanted to see something really messed up, you had to go out of your way to find it. But now, it's just a few clicks away. And that's not good for anyone. And don't even get me started on the porn. I mean, sure, it's always been around, but now it's everywhere. And it's not just your run-of-the-mill stuff, either. There's all kinds of weird shit out there that people are getting into. And it's not just adults, either. Kids are being exposed to this stuff at younger and younger ages, and that's just not right. I mean, sex is supposed to be something special, something intimate. But now it's just another thing that people do. And that's not how it should be. We need to start treating sex with the respect it deserves, and that means not exposing kids to all the crazy stuff that's out there. And it's not just the porn that's the problem. It's also the fact that the internet has made everything so damn easy. Kids can find anything they want online, and that's not always a good thing. They need to learn how to think for themselves, how to make their own decisions. But with the internet, everything is just handed to them on a silver platter. And it's not just the kids who are affected by this. Adults are just as bad. They spend all their time on social media, arguing with strangers and spreading hate. It's like they've forgotten how to interact with people in the real world. And that's just sad. But it's not all bad. There are some good things about the internet, too. Like Wikipedia, for example. I mean, sure, it's not always accurate, but it's a great resource for learning about all kinds of things. And there are plenty of other sites out there that are just as good. And let's not forget about all the great movies and TV shows that are available online. I mean, sure, there's a lot of crap out there, but there are also some really great shows that you can't find anywhere else. And that's pretty cool. But overall, I think the internet is doing more harm than good. It's exposing kids to all kinds of messed up stuff, and it's making adults forget how to interact with people in the real world. We need to start taking a step back and thinking about what we're doing to ourselves and our kids. Because if we don't, things are only going to get worse.
