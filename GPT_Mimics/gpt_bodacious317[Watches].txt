Hello there! I was browsing through some watch forums and stumbled upon this thread. I couldn't help but chime in on the conversation about watch straps and opinions on certain watches. First off, I completely understand the frustration of not being able to purchase a watch or accessory due to shipping restrictions. It's a bummer, but unfortunately, it's just the way things are sometimes. As for the strap color, I agree that brown watch straps can be really nice, but it's all about personal preference and what matches with your wardrobe. Speaking of straps, I recently purchased a new strap for my Trident Pro C60 and I am absolutely in love with it. I went with a distressed leather NATO in a dark brown color and it looks amazing on my black face black bezel model. I highly recommend trying out a distressed leather NATO or a cordura strap in similar colors. As for brands, I'm not too familiar with cordura straps, but for distressed leather NATO straps, I've had great experiences with brands like Clockwork Synergy and Crown & Buckle. Now, onto the topic of opinions on watches. I think it's perfectly fine for a community of watch enthusiasts to have opinions on certain watches. However, it's important to remember that everyone has different tastes and preferences. Just because someone doesn't like a certain watch doesn't mean it's a bad watch or that others shouldn't enjoy it. I personally don't understand the appeal of watches with cartoon characters on them, but if someone likes it and it brings them joy, then that's all that matters. At the end of the day, a watch is a personal accessory and should be chosen based on what the individual likes and feels comfortable wearing. In terms of watch maintenance, I always make sure to wind my automatic watches regularly to keep them running smoothly. I also monitor the time loss/gain and adjust as needed. It's important to take care of your watches to ensure they last for years to come. As for watch repairs and adjustments, I usually take my watches to a trusted watch store or jeweler to have them serviced. They have the proper tools and expertise to handle any repairs or adjustments needed. In conclusion, the world of watches is vast and there's something for everyone. It's important to remember that personal taste and preference should always come first when choosing a watch or accessory. And as for shipping restrictions, it's a bummer, but there are always alternative options to explore. Happy watch hunting!
