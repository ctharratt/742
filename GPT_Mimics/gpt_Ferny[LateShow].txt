Shamwow Chiapet, what a name! I mean, you can just tell that this guy is a pirate through and through. He's got that rugged, swashbuckling look about him that just screams "I sail the seven seas and plunder treasure!" And did you see how he reacted when the audience started chanting Stephen's name? He didn't want any part of that, no sir. He's a man who likes to do things his own way, and I respect that. But let's talk about the interview, because that's what we're all here for, right? I mean, sure, Meyers gives great interviews, but there's just something about Stephen that sets him apart. Maybe it's his quick wit, or his ability to make even the most boring guests seem interesting. Whatever it is, he's got it in spades. And speaking of interviews, did you catch Affleck on Corden last night? I mean, I know we're here to talk about Colbert, but I just have to say, that man is a national treasure. He's got charm, he's got charisma, and he's got a killer smile. I could watch him talk for hours. But back to Colbert. Did you see how he was digging the cobalt blue background? I mean, I don't blame him. It's a great color. And I love how he's always changing up the picture in the background depending on the guest. It's a nice touch. And Brody, man, that guy looks like he'd be a blast to get high with. I mean, I don't condone drug use or anything, but you can just tell that he's a fun guy to be around. And I love that someone made an account just to ask about him. That's dedication. But let's talk about Casey Affleck for a minute. That guy has got some serious little brother syndrome. You can just tell that he's always trying to prove himself to big brother Ben. But you know what? I think he could hold his own against Stephen. He's got that "I don't care, I'll keep coming back for more" mentality that could make for some great TV. And speaking of great TV, did you catch Triumph riding a drone? I mean, I never thought I'd see the day. But that's what I love about Colbert. He's always pushing the boundaries, always trying new things. And that's why he doesn't need a sidekick. He's got enough talent to carry the show all on his own. But if he did get a sidekick, who would it be? Personally, I think someone like Kimmel's cousin Sal would be perfect. He's funny, he's relatable, and he's not afraid to make a fool of himself. Plus, he could do those street skits through the big screen, just like Kimmel does. It would be a great addition to the show. And let's not forget about the end of show performances. Colbert always knocks it out of the park with those. Even the acro-cats, which I wasn't sure about at first, turned out to be pretty entertaining. And those colorful bagels? Genius. I mean, I don't know how he comes up with this stuff, but I'm glad he does. And did you catch Obama on the show? That man is a legend. I mean, say what you want about his politics, but you can't deny that he's got charisma for days. And that's why he's one of the best guests Colbert has ever had. But let's talk about the Super Bowl for a minute. Colbert is going to be live after the game, which is pretty impressive. I mean, does he know his sports or what? I can't wait to see what he has in store for us. And finally, let's talk about Strahan. That guy is doing it right. He's got Kelly and Michael on ABC, he goes on Good Morning America, and he does the football thing on Fox. He's everywhere, and he's killing it. Plus, he's got that infectious smile that just makes you want to watch him all day. So there you have it, folks. My ramblings on all things Colbert. I could go on for hours, but I think I've made my point. Colbert is the man, and he doesn't need a sidekick to prove it.
