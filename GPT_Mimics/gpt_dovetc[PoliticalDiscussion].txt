Well, let me tell you something, folks. I don't blame the drug war on Republicans any more than Democrats. There are douche bags who want to lock up pot smokers on both sides of the aisle. It's just a fact. And let me tell you, as far as social programs go, there is a fundamental difference in the way Republicans view various forms of welfare than Democrats in general. We generally see a terrible potential for social programs to create dependence on the government and don't believe they do anyone any favors if they incentivize poverty and unemployment. There is a place for them, sure. However, the fact is when you make it easier to not work and still eat, have kids out of wedlock, have a terrible diet and still receive expensive treatment, etc etc, you have incentivized it. Democrats tend to point to this and say "They're going to take away something that's designed to help poor black people!!! They must hate black people." But I feel like we're just really bad at getting the message out there to counter their claim by saying "We're trying to reform a system that has helped to destroy black civil society over the past 40+ years." As a Republican, it feels like the Dems are constantly suggesting that the Republicans hate black people and we're standing over here wondering what the hell they're talking about. Just one man's opinion, but I get the impression that the Democrats push this narrative to further their political agenda. And let me tell you, folks, your attitude is what makes Trump possible. People are tired of being told they're uneducated bigots just because they're not a left-coast styled liberal progressive. They're tired of being spoken down to by their president who acts like loving America is a character trait endemic to rednecks. Exactly. I recall this example: Which statement is more racist? "The Japs made great and swift advancements in modernizing during the second half of the nineteenth century" or "Peoples or East Asian descent ought to stick to their own kind when selecting a spouse"? As a white person with a dark complexion who gets asked about his ethnicity quite often, I have to disagree with you. There's nothing frustrating about someone's curiosity in the matter. I don't think it's completely fair to say that you can't create a better world with technology. There are myriad aspects of modern technology which make the world a better place to live. Are there trade-offs? Sure. The point, however, is that what we're measuring in this discussion is not whether technology is better than poetry, but rather should lenders be realistic in setting their rates based on as many factors as they can reasonably be able to factor in. Except it's not based on any aspect inherent to that person. You can, as a loan provider in most other contexts, discriminate based on the field in which the borrower works. If they have a commission-based job with a wildly fluctuating income versus a stable salaried government job with great security. Actuaries who measure the risk of lending to a person in normal adult life aren't said to be discriminating when they refuse to lend to an artist. Why should it be any different when the lender is offering a loan to a prospective artist? I don't think you're paying attention if you don't think this gets leveled at other candidates. Trump has faced this on many issues because he used to be fairly liberal. He responded by stating that he had a sort of political awakening about this and people have generally left him alone on it after that. Rubio has faced a similar struggle in regards to immigration where he supported the gang of eight bill which amounted to amnesty, but is now trying to distance himself from that as it is unpopular within the Republican base and is a major impediment to him getting the nomination. I think Hillary gets flack for it because her shifts on things like the Iraq war and gay marriage occurred right about the time polls showed Americans in general shift to being majority in favor of her "reformed" views. I reject the premise of your statement about gun control and Bernie Sanders. More gun control is a losing issue for the Dems. The reason Bernie is moving is because he is trying to win the Democratic primaries. He's not moving that direction because he believes that the majority of Americans will support efforts to limit gun rights. As soon as the primary season is over, any smart democrat candidate will get very silent on all this reactionary assault-style weapon ban talk and gunshow loophole bullshite they use to pander to their base. That's idiotic. I can't quote Henry Ford or Martin Luther without being an anti-semite because they were? I can't quote any of the founding fathers if I don't hold that only land-owning men should have the vote? Then you don't know Hilldog. May the force be with you. Mexico is known to have one of the strictest policies on illegal immigration. Thank you. That's all that needs to be done. People act like there's this really tough problem to deal with. It's not mean to deport illegal aliens. You think Mexico would hesitate to deport you if you illegally immigrated there? Coupled with a porous border. Or they return to their home country where they can find work. Remember that the whole reason they came here was to find work in the first place. They've shown a willingness to immigrate in order to find employment. While I loves me some Ted Cruz, I'm gonna have to see some other polls reflecting similar numbers before I start predicting Trump's demise. Women aren't nearly the loyal Democratic voting bloc that blacks are. Considering that VP is often a springboard to the nomination 8 years later, I would imagine most everyone in the field would accept as they want to be president at some point in their life. It's also a pretty easy job that keeps a person politically relevant without having to actually DO much. I have to disagree with your analysis of Trump's effect on the size of the Republican tent. I don't even like the guy, but he's gotten people who were politically apathetic excited because he's not like what they're used to choosing from in an election. The case could be made, however, that Trump is not actually the cause but rather a symptom of people becoming politically active who had heretofore been ambivalent due not to Trump's personality or ideas but rather because of dissatisfaction with Obama and his cosmopolitan "we're no better than any other country" attitude. I didn't say they would be shoo-ins. I just think they would do a lot better than a Jeb Bush type or other establishment types because of the strong anti-establishment sentiment going on this time around. I've even read comments on this site by self-professed Democrats who would consider not only staying home for a Hillary candidacy but voting for Trump on account of disdain for the Washington insider oligarchy. I know that's the exception and not the rule, but my point stands. The establishment Republicans represent the weaker options for the GOP ticket this time around.
