Alright, let's get one thing straight here. Trump has been surprising everyone left and right, and that's just a fact. But when it comes to talking about the percentage of NYC that certain groups make up, we need to be careful not to generalize. Manhattan may be dense, but it's far from poor. And just because there are loud minorities doesn't mean they represent the entire group. I mean, do you hate Black Lives Matter or something? Now, let's talk about Republicans. Most of them don't care if the government gives gays the same rights as everyone else. The whole argument about the word "marriage" was just stupid, and both parties were at fault. And when it comes to abortion, only 19% of the country opposes it completely. After that, things get a bit murky, but most Republicans don't oppose it. In my original post, I said that 1/4th of the poor white population and 1/4th of the poor black population were committing crimes. I'm not backtracking on anything here, folks. And if you think I'm confused, well, you've managed to confuse me too. But let's be clear: NY is densely populated everywhere, but it's not densely populated and poor everywhere. Policing will be different based on economics, not race. Manhattan won't have the same policing as the Bronx because the amount of crime is different, not because of race. And let's not forget that black criminals often put themselves in the barrel by living in densely populated poor areas. It's just easier to catch them there. It's like fishing. If you put 500 fish in a lake and tell Fisherman Bob to catch some fish, he'll catch 10. But if you put 50 fish in a barrel and tell Fisherman Bob to use the same technique, he'll catch 25. It's just basic math, people. Now, if you have more police per block in a densely populated area, they're going to have higher numbers of arrests compared to an area with fewer cops. That's why the incarceration rate per person would be higher. But what are the arrest and conviction rates of whites vs. blacks? If they're similar, then it's evidence that racism isn't the cause of arrest and conviction rates in NYC. And let's not forget that Manhattan is different from the Bronx. The policing in Manhattan will be different than the policing in the Bronx, regardless of race. And let's talk about Republicans again. Most of them don't oppose abortion, and most of them don't care if gays get married. So why do people keep saying they do? And what Democrat is pushing for prison reform? Is pandering really that bad? If you say something and the people who elected you disagree, are you a flip-flopper for listening to your constituents and doing what they want? Look, you can argue that racism fueled poverty all day long. And sure, the economic racism of the past placed the black community at a disadvantage. But that doesn't mean that today's policing is racist if the police force spends most of their resources in densely populated high crime areas. And I'm not claiming that one group is committing more crime than the other. Poor whites and poor blacks will commit similar amounts of crime. But here's the thing: if poor black people continue to live in densely populated areas, they're going to come across police far more often than a poor white person living in a sparsely populated rural area. And if that doesn't change, why would the numbers change? It's just common sense, people. And let's not forget about those prison guard unions. Something needs to be done about them, but the Democrats aren't going to do anything, and the Republicans support private prisons to provide competition. It's a mess, folks. So what's the solution? Well, we need to focus on the real problem here. And that's why I'm so pissed off that so many people fall for the same old tricks. We need to research all the best ways to run prisons and offer contracts to private prisons that will run their prisons in the best possible manner. And we need to slowly start to shut down public prisons until the unions agree to change their way of doing things. And let's not forget about the importance of voting. Your vote for a Congressman holds the same weight as someone in Kansas, and Congress holds far more power than the President. So if your state is mostly farms and not entertaining, you still need to vote. In conclusion, let's not generalize about certain groups, and let's focus on the real problem here. We need to research the best ways to run prisons and offer contracts to private prisons that will run their prisons in the best possible manner. And we need to slowly start to shut down public prisons until the unions agree to change their way of doing things. It's not going to be easy, but it's the only way we can make a real difference.
