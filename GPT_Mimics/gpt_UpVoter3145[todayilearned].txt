The topic of cultural diversity is one that has been discussed at length in recent years. While some argue that it is important to preserve one's ancestral culture, others believe that it is better to assimilate into the culture of the country in which one resides. As the child of immigrants, I have seen both sides of this debate and have come to my own conclusions. Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that cultural diversity can be a positive thing. Exposure to different cultures can broaden one's horizons and lead to a greater understanding and appreciation of the world around us. However, it is also important to recognize that there can be negative consequences to cultural diversity, particularly when it comes to the integration of immigrants into their new home country. One of the biggest challenges facing immigrants is the language barrier. While it is certainly possible to learn a new language, it can be difficult and time-consuming. This can lead to immigrants feeling isolated and disconnected from their new community. Additionally, if parents do not speak the language of their new country, it can be difficult for them to help their children with homework or communicate with their teachers. Another challenge facing immigrants is the preservation of their ancestral culture. While it is certainly important to remember one's roots, it is also important to recognize that some aspects of one's ancestral culture may not be compatible with the culture of their new home country. For example, if a family comes from a culture where women are expected to be subservient to men, this may not be acceptable in their new home country. It is important for immigrants to be willing to adapt to the culture of their new home country in order to fully integrate into their new community. That being said, it is also important for the culture of the new home country to be accepting of immigrants. This means providing resources to help immigrants learn the language and adapt to their new culture, as well as being willing to accept and appreciate the unique contributions that immigrants can bring to their new community. In my own experience, my parents made a conscious effort to assimilate into Canadian culture while still maintaining some aspects of their ancestral culture. For example, we would celebrate traditional holidays from our ancestral culture, but we would also celebrate Canadian holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. My parents also made sure that my siblings and I were fluent in both English and their ancestral language, which has been a valuable asset in our personal and professional lives. Ultimately, I believe that cultural diversity can be a positive thing, but it is important for immigrants to be willing to adapt to the culture of their new home country in order to fully integrate into their new community. At the same time, it is important for the culture of the new home country to be accepting of immigrants and to provide resources to help them adapt to their new culture. By working together, we can create a more inclusive and welcoming society for all.
