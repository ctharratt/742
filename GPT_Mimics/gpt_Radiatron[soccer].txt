Alright, let's talk football. The beautiful game, the sport that brings people together, the reason why we all gather around our screens or head to the stadium on a Saturday afternoon. It's been a wild ride this year, hasn't it? The whole squad has done themselves proud, especially after dicking Kiev. That was a moment to remember, a moment that showed us what our team is capable of. And now, we're seeing a few more players start to break through after Fry did. It's exciting to see new talent emerge, to see the future of our team take shape. But let's be real, it was never going to be an easy road in the post-Ferguson years. We knew that. History favors those that try, but laughs at those who trip over themselves in the process. And boy, have we seen some tripping this year. But that's part of the game, isn't it? The ups and downs, the highs and lows, the moments that make us scream with joy and the moments that make us want to tear our hair out. And speaking of hair, I expected to see loads of it this year, and I'm happy to say that I have. In case we qualify, of course. But seriously, in a more general way, I just like to see our league being represented well in Europe. It's one thing to laugh at us for beating Man City last year in the FA Cup, but I also like to see them beating the Europeans too. That's actually why I'm supporting all the English sides every year at the moment. I have serious concerns that we'll lose a spot in the next few years, and that's not something I want to see happen. Let's talk about our players for a moment. We have some incredible talent on our team, don't we? Some of them are sluggish, sure, but they make up for it with incredible goals and wins. Take Fry, for example. He's been a brilliant player this year, and I love watching him on the field. And let's not forget about the tax evaders. Sure, it's not like that has any impact on the field, but they're not quarter final evaders like Arsenal now, are they? But let's move on from that. Let's talk about why we love football. For me, it's all about the atmosphere. There's nothing quite like being in the stadium, surrounded by thousands of fans, all cheering for the same team. It's electric, it's exciting, and it's something that you can't replicate anywhere else. And let's not forget about the players themselves. When you see someone like Costa or Messi or Ronaldo on the field, it's a moment to remember. You can say you actually saw player x and y in person if they're amazing. It's why I'm off to Chelsea Stoke in a week and a bit with a Chelsea mate. I don't support either team, but I love the general buzz and actually being able to say I've seen class players, in this case guys like Costa and stuff. But let's not forget about the bigger picture. Football isn't just about our team or our league. It's a global sport, one that brings people together from all over the world. And that's why I think it's important to support other teams and other leagues too. There are an awful lot of African countries who would still vote for Sep, in my opinion. And let's not forget about the decisions that are made off the field. Sometimes they swing the complete wrong way, like when we had points deducted rather than just giving Blackburn them. It would have been different if we'd forfeited and Blackburn had fairly gotten the points or we'd lost and they'd got the point. But no, they had to take 3 points off us. It's a joke, really. And speaking of jokes, let's talk about the refs. There's always a fair bit of hate directed towards them, isn't there? But it tends to be more specific refs who get hated than the general quality of it from what I gather. Ravenelli, Emerson, and Juninho. Awww yeeaahhh. And let's not forget about the games themselves. Middlesbrough vs Cardiff? Good guy Arsenal fans in this topic, I like what I see. But let's move on from that. Let's talk about the bigger issues. Like why do you throw bread at your Pokemon? I mean, seriously, what's up with that? And let's not forget about the managers. They have a huge impact on the game, don't they? But sometimes, it feels like they have too much control. Like when Ferguson was in charge of our team. Don't get me wrong, he's a legend, but why are his views important in this matter? It just feels counterproductive having someone with as much influence as Ferguson with control like that in the side's management. But let's not forget about the fans. They're the heart and soul of the game, aren't they? And sometimes, they get a raw deal. Like when Sky have the influence to actually cause a rearrangement of fixtures. It's a joke, really. And let's not forget about the players themselves. They're the ones who make the game what it is. And sometimes, they get a raw deal too. Like when they're forced to play with a weakened team or essentially a youth side because of the volume. It's not fair, and it's not right. They should have given Blackburn the 3 points, not taken 3 off us. But let's move on from that. Let's talk about the future. What does it hold for our team? For our league? For football as a whole? It's hard to say, really. But one thing's for sure: we'll keep watching, we'll keep cheering, and we'll keep loving the game. Because at the end of the day, that's what it's all about. The love of the game, the passion, the excitement. It's what brings us together, and it's what makes us who we are. So let's keep watching, let's keep cheering, and let's keep loving the beautiful game.
