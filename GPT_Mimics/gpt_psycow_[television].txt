I don't understand why some TV shows just can't seem to get it right. It's like they have a great premise, but then they just can't execute it properly. I've seen it happen time and time again, with shows like Jericho and Limitless. I mean, I didn't actually stop watching Limitless after the first episode, but after like 3 or 4. I really liked the movie and the premise of this show, but it quickly turned into a mediocre procedural, kind of like a bad version of Person of Interest. But then again, maybe I'm being too harsh. After all, I did hear that they're shooting a scene for the next season in Berlin. Apparently they needed snow but it was like 10°C outside, so they turned the whole riverfront into a winter scene with some white powder. It looked kinda funny, but hey, at least they're trying to make it work. And to be fair, the show did get better after a few episodes. I'll definitely watch season 2. I just wish they could have done more with the concept. I mean, the idea of a drug that can unlock the full potential of your brain is fascinating. But instead of exploring the implications of that, they just turned it into another police procedural. Speaking of police procedurals, have you guys seen Person of Interest? It's actually a pretty good show. It's about this guy who creates an AI that can predict crimes before they happen, and then he teams up with a former CIA agent to stop them. It's got some great action scenes and some really interesting characters. Definitely worth checking out if you're into that kind of thing. But enough about TV shows. Let's talk about movies. Have you guys seen the new Planet Earth produced by Netflix? I read about it somewhere, but I'm not sure if it's actually out yet. I watched both seasons of the original Planet Earth, and they were amazing. The cinematography was breathtaking, and the way they captured the beauty of nature was truly awe-inspiring. I'm sure the new one will be just as good, if not better. Speaking of Netflix, have you guys noticed how they're starting to produce their own content now? It's kind of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it's great that they're taking risks and trying new things. On the other hand, some of their shows are just not that good. I mean, have you seen some of the stuff they put out? It's like they're just throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks. But then again, maybe that's just the nature of the beast. With so many streaming services out there, it's hard to stand out. And with so much content being produced, it's hard to keep up. I mean, I don't know about you guys, but I feel like I'm drowning in TV shows and movies. There's just so much to watch, and so little time. And don't even get me started on the different streaming services. It's a complete clusterfuck. I mean, you've got Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO Go, and a million others. And each one has its own exclusive content. It's like they're all trying to be the next big thing, but they're just diluting the market. Speaking of Amazon Prime, have you guys taken advantage of their free delivery for books and any purchase over 30€? It's a pretty good deal, if you ask me. I've never ended up ordering below 30€, so that particular Prime feature has never been a selling point to me. But I know some people who swear by it. Anyway, back to TV shows. I really hope they don't ruin Limitless. I love this show, but it needs an end date and plan. Unfortunately, Showtime will probably run it into the ground. I'm worried about the characters this season, everyone seems a tad too crazy by now. I mean, I get that they're all on this super drug, but still. It's like they're all losing their minds. And speaking of losing their minds, did you guys see the Emmys? A lot of people were angry that Wolf Hall beat out Fargo, but that probably isn't fair as I doubt barely anyone here has seen both. I mean, I haven't seen Wolf Hall, but I heard it's pretty good. Do I have to watch it to at least be surprised? I mean, Fargo Season 2 is widely regarded as one of the best seasons in the history of television. I also expected Patrick Wilson to win. But yes, I'm extremely biased. But bias aside, I think we can all agree that there's just too much content out there. It's overwhelming, and it's hard to know what to watch. I mean, I've grown tired of cartoons (don't recommend those), and I feel like I've seen everything on Netflix and Hulu. Maybe it's time to start reading more books or something. Or maybe I just need to take a break from all this content. Maybe I need to unplug and go outside for a bit. Maybe I need to appreciate the beauty of nature, like they do in Planet Earth. Or maybe I just need to watch more TV shows. Who knows? All I know is that there's a lot of content out there, and it's hard to keep up.
