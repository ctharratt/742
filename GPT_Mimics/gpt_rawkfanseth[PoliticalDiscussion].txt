The 2016 US Presidential Election has been one of the most talked-about events in recent history. The race has been filled with twists and turns, with candidates dropping out and new ones entering the fray. As a liberal, I have been closely following the election and have been disheartened by the fact that the GOP controls both houses of Congress. I am not confident that Hillary Clinton can win the general election, and I am worried about what the government will look like after the November elections. One of the most interesting aspects of this election has been the rise of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Both candidates have been controversial, with Trump making headlines for his inflammatory comments and Cruz being seen as too extreme by some. As a liberal, I have been torn about who to root for. On the one hand, I want the Democratic base to get out and vote, so I should be rooting for a Cruz or Trump nomination. On the other hand, the thought of either of them becoming president makes me feel dirty. Cruz is somewhat libertarian, with a heavy dose of evangelicalism. It will be interesting to see what the government looks like if he becomes president. Trump, on the other hand, is a wildcard. He has no political experience and has made a number of controversial statements. I am not sure what to make of him, but I do not think he would make a good president. The GOP controls both houses of Congress, which is a concern for me as a liberal. I am not confident that Hillary Clinton can win the general election, but I am hopeful that the Democrats can take back the Senate. Many GOP seats are at risk in 2016, and I think there is a chance that the Democrats could take back the Senate. However, every seat in the House is at risk in 2016, so it is difficult to say what will happen. One of the most talked-about issues in this election has been healthcare. Planned Parenthood has been a hot topic, with many Republicans calling for the defunding of the organization. However, Medicaid is the main source of Planned Parenthood funding, not Title X funds. This is an important distinction to make. There has also been a lot of talk about single-payer healthcare. While I think our healthcare system could use some stronger regulation to make it more affordable, I do not necessarily think that a single-payer system is the answer. The United States could look to Germany's healthcare system as a model. I think we need to make our healthcare system more affordable, but we do not necessarily need a single-payer system to do so. The Democratic primaries have been interesting to watch. Bernie Sanders has been gaining momentum, and I think he will win New Hampshire. I lean towards Clinton, but I am glad to see Sanders doing well. This country needs to consider some truly left-wing ideas, and I think Sanders is the candidate to do that. I am not a fan of Ted Cruz, and I was disheartened to hear that Glenn Beck is warming up the crowd for him. It seems odd to me that someone could change their mind so much. However, it is not a foregone conclusion that Cruz will win the nomination. Let's see where we are after Super Tuesday. If Cruz gets pummeled, he might drop out, and then Rubio will rise. I think it is naive to think that Republicans will work with Hillary or Bernie. Maybe Bernie can energize a massive political revolution that would give Congress a new look. I think we need to shift from a winner-take-all system to a mixed-member proportional representation system, but that will never happen. Bernie might bring in a wave election like Obama in 2008. Time will tell. I am leading towards O'Malley in the primaries. That will be my "fun vote". Then I will vote for Clinton in the general. I will never forgive myself if we have a President Cruz and I did not vote for Hillary. The moderators of the debates have been a topic of discussion as well. I was not impressed with their job, and I think they could have done better. However, I was glad to see them step in when necessary. The Clinton email scandal has been a hot topic as well. I am not sure if she will be indicted, but I do not think it will be by Congress. That is who she will have to work with if she becomes president, and I do not think they will be kind to her. Overall, this election has been one of the most interesting in recent history. The rise of Trump and Cruz has been controversial, and the Democratic primaries have been exciting to watch. I am hopeful that the Democrats can take back the Senate, but I am not confident that Hillary Clinton can win the general election. Only time will tell what the government will look like after the November elections.
