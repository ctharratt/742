Hey there! Thanks for sharing all those great ideas with me. I'm excited to try some of them out and see how they work for my family. I have to admit, I had no idea who Thomas Keller was either, but I'm definitely going to check out some of his videos now. And the milk jug idea is genius! I never would have thought of that. As for the dead hookers comment...let's just say I'm glad you have a sense of humor. Moving on! I love the idea of getting my kids involved in cooking, but I can definitely see how it could get messy fast. I think it's worth it though, to teach them valuable skills and get them excited about food. And I like your idea of having some basic recipes that we can mix and match each week. That way we don't have to reinvent the wheel every time we cook. I'm not a big seafood person either, but I know it's important to expose my kids to different types of food. The "2 bite rule" is a great idea, and I think it's important for parents to lead by example and try new things too. Who knows, maybe we'll discover some new favorite dishes! I like the idea of timing crock pot meals so that we can have leftovers for the next day. I haven't really experienced push back from my kids about leftovers, but I can see how it could happen. I think it's important to involve them in the meal planning process so that they feel like they have some say in what they're eating. I don't have a rotisserie grill, but I do have a countertop grill that works pretty well. And I agree that it's important for kids to see their parents eating the same things they are. It sets a good example and shows them that we're all in this together. I've never tried steaming veggies in a ziplock bag, but it's worth a shot! And I think it's great that you're open to trying new types of cuisine, like Indian food. I've never made dessert pizza before, but it sounds like a fun idea. And I think a weekly pasta night is totally doable. On a more serious note, I appreciate your concern about my teenager. It's definitely a tough situation, but we're doing our best to support her and get her the help she needs. Therapy is definitely something we're considering, and I think it's important for parents to be proactive about their kids' mental health. Overall, I think the key to feeding a family is to be flexible, open-minded, and willing to try new things. It's not always easy, but it's worth it to see our kids grow up healthy and happy. Thanks again for all your great ideas, and I look forward to talking more soon!
