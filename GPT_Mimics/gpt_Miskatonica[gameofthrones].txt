As a die-hard Game of Thrones fan, I have spent countless hours discussing and theorizing about the show with my fellow fans. One topic that always seems to come up is the White Walkers and their ultimate goal. What do they want? What are they after? And why are they so intent on killing humans? First, let's start with what we know about the White Walkers. They are a race of supernatural beings who were created by the Children of the Forest thousands of years ago to protect them from the First Men. However, the White Walkers eventually turned on their creators and began to wage war against all of humanity. We also know that the White Walkers are incredibly powerful and seemingly invincible. They can raise the dead and turn them into wights, which are essentially zombie-like creatures that serve the White Walkers. They are also immune to most weapons and can only be killed with Valyrian steel or dragonglass. But what is their ultimate goal? Some fans believe that the White Walkers simply want to wipe out all of humanity and rule over the world themselves. Others believe that they have a more specific goal in mind, such as finding a way to reproduce or gaining access to some sort of magical power. One theory that I find particularly interesting is that the White Walkers are actually trying to bring about a new age of magic. In the world of Game of Thrones, magic has been slowly fading away for centuries. Dragons, which were once thought to be extinct, have returned to the world, and many characters have exhibited magical abilities. It's possible that the White Walkers are trying to bring about a new era of magic by wiping out humanity and allowing the Children of the Forest to reclaim their land. Another theory is that the White Walkers are simply trying to survive. In the books, it's revealed that the White Walkers are vulnerable to obsidian (also known as dragonglass) because it is made from volcanic glass, which is essentially frozen fire. This has led some fans to speculate that the White Walkers are actually beings of ice and that they are trying to find a way to survive in a world that is becoming increasingly warm. Of course, these are all just theories, and we won't know the true motivations of the White Walkers until the show or books reveal them. But one thing is for sure: the White Walkers are a formidable enemy, and the humans of Westeros will need to band together if they hope to defeat them. Speaking of banding together, one of the most interesting aspects of the show is the way that characters from different parts of the world are forced to work together in order to survive. For example, Jon Snow, who was once a member of the Night's Watch, has teamed up with the wildlings, who were once his enemies. Similarly, Daenerys Targaryen, who was once an exile, has formed alliances with various groups in order to build her army and take back the Iron Throne. One of the most intriguing alliances in the show is between Arya Stark and the Faceless Men. The Faceless Men are a group of assassins who worship the Many-Faced God and are known for their ability to change their appearance at will. Arya, who has always been a bit of a rebel, is drawn to the Faceless Men because they offer her a chance to become someone else entirely. But what is the ultimate goal of the Faceless Men? Are they simply a group of assassins for hire, or do they have a larger purpose? Some fans believe that the Faceless Men are actually working to bring about the end of the world, and that they are using Arya as a pawn in their game. Another interesting alliance is between Tyrion Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen. Tyrion, who was once despised by his family and forced to flee Westeros, has found a new home with Daenerys and her army. Together, they are working to take back the Iron Throne and restore the Targaryen dynasty. But what will happen if they succeed? Will Tyrion be content to serve as Daenerys' Hand, or will he want more power for himself? And what will happen to the other characters who have pledged their loyalty to Daenerys, such as Jorah Mormont and Grey Worm? Ultimately, the alliances and motivations of the characters in Game of Thrones are what make the show so compelling. We never know who to trust or what will happen next, and that keeps us on the edge of our seats. As the show enters its final season, I can't wait to see how these alliances will play out and what the ultimate fate of Westeros will be.
