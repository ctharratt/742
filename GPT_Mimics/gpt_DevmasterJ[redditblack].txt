Yo, what's up guys? It's been a minute since I've been on here, but I had to come back and talk about some recent events. First off, I just got an Xbox for Christmas and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. Zing. I've been playing non-stop and it's been a blast. But let's talk about some recent sports events. Did you guys see the Dolphins beat the Eagles? Just brutal man. Once Sanchez went in, I knew it was over. Then boom, INT in the endzone. Eat it, Eagles. Fins up, baby. Speaking of gaming, have you guys played Animal Crossing? I could hear my homie playing it in the background and it sounds like a blast. But let me tell you, /u/tommynottom is actually the worst zombies player. He had a negative fucking KD in that shit when we played it in Blops II. Sorry, bro, but it's true. On a more serious note, how are you guys doing? I've been busy with work and playing in a LoL league. Playoffs start next week and I'm hoping to make it to the finals on Nov 7th and 8th. But let's talk about some other sports stuff. The Blue Jays have been killing it lately, but they struggle in KC's park. Not much of a homerun park, unfortunately. Price is pitching tonight and Stroman is pitching tomorrow. BELIEVE. But let's get back to gaming. Have you guys played Rocket League? It's so much fun. Let's get a game going sometime. And speaking of games, I've been trying to qualify for an actual League of Legends league for the past few weeks. We managed to go undefeated in qualifiers and finished tied for the #1 seed going into the regular season. There were 33 teams registered. All games throughout the regular season will be live streamed and commentated. Hope to see you guys out there sometime ;) And let's not forget about some of the drama that's been going on in the community. I won't name names, but there's been some shit going down. Let's all just be cool and have fun playing games together. And if you're gonna bring up some drama, at least pick a better avenue than a community night thread. Just saying. But let's end on a positive note. I miss you guys so fucking much. Just been so insanely busy with work and life. But I got some more ink a couple days ago and I'm feeling good. Check it out. And let's get some more Rocket League going. Let's get some of that Rocket League going! Let's get some of that Rocket League going! Let's get some of that Rocket League going! Let's get some of that Rocket League going! Let's get some of that Rocket League going! ;) Alright, that's all for now. Stay cool, my friends.
