Well, let me tell you something, folks. Every time I walk past a construction site downtown, I swear to God, it smells like weed. And you know what? That's just fine by me. It means that the workers are human, just like you and me. They're out there busting their asses in the hot sun, and if they want to take a little break and smoke a joint, who am I to judge? But you know what really grinds my gears? When people start punishing others for what COULD HAVE happened. I mean, come on. If we started throwing people in jail for every little thing they might have done, we'd all be behind bars. And let me tell you, most of the idiots on here probably don't even drive a car. You know why? Because the odds of getting killed on the road are much higher than the odds of getting high on a construction site. Now, I'm not saying that dangerous situations should be ignored. Of course not. But let's be real here. If someone does something stupid and nobody gets hurt, then what's the harm? Take that driver who posted a PSA to pedestrians on r/toronto. Sure, it was a scary situation, but it could have been handled better. And blaming pedestrians for the driver's mistake? That's just ridiculous. It's like a taxi driver whining about Uber. Nobody gives a shit. Speaking of renting out condos, let me give you some advice. If you want to be a good landlord, there are a few things you can do. First of all, offer longer leases. Every month that your unit stays empty is the same as losing $125-$150 on a 1-year lease. And if you can, offer professional cleaning services. It might cost a little extra, but it's worth it. You could also include parking and locker space in the lease, even if your tenant doesn't need it. Then you can rent it out separately and make some extra cash. And don't forget to offer low maintenance options. Coordinate any maintenance or repair work so the owner doesn't have to do it. Think like a landlord and reduce their risk and effort in exchange for your time and effort. It's a win-win situation. Now, let's talk about lawyers. You know what really grinds my gears? When people start whining about having to work for a living. I mean, come on. The LSUC dishes out very little discipline, and anything they do is done in private. You lawyers are about as awful as the pigs. And don't even get me started on fad diets. If you want to be healthy, you need to exercise and eat properly. It's not rocket science. But let's talk about something positive for a change. Have you guys heard of the ROSS guys? They're a great group of people with a lot of potential. And speaking of potential, that property on King/Church that sold for only $4 million a few years ago? That's crazy. It's not like there was a huge condo on the property at the time. People need to stop criticizing things they don't understand. And speaking of criticizing, let's talk about the police. You know what really grinds my gears? When they waste taxpayer's money on bullshit investigations. And don't even get me started on the pigs who shoot unarmed teens. It's disgusting. And the fact that they won't name the man in the DNA match? That's just shady. But let's end on a positive note. You know what I respect? A guy who is humble enough to change his opinion in the face of facts. And you know what else I respect? A good deal. That property on King/Church might have sold for only $4 million a few years ago, but that doesn't mean it's not worth more now. And if you're looking for a good deal, check out apa.ca. It's the best money you'll ever spend. In conclusion, folks, let's all try to be a little more understanding. We're all human, and we all make mistakes. But if we can learn from those mistakes and work together, we can make this city a better place. And if you don't like what I have to say, well, you can tell the other commenters to fuck off. Good luck.
