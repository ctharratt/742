As the 2020 presidential election approaches, the Democratic Party is facing a crucial decision. Who will be their nominee to take on incumbent President Donald Trump? Many Democrats are still reeling from the shock of Trump's victory in 2016 and are determined to put forward a candidate who can defeat him in November. But who is the best candidate for the job? For many progressives, the answer is clear: Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator has been a champion of progressive causes for decades, and his 2016 campaign energized a generation of young voters. But despite his popularity, Sanders faces an uphill battle to win the nomination. The Democratic establishment is wary of his anti-establishment message, and many voters are still skeptical of his democratic socialist views. So what can Sanders do to win over more voters and secure the nomination? One strategy is to focus on his electability. Many Democrats are understandably anxious about defeating Trump, and Sanders can make a strong case that he is the candidate best positioned to do so. First and foremost, Sanders has a proven track record of winning elections. He has been elected to the Senate multiple times and has won every election he has contested since 1981. This demonstrates that he has broad appeal across different demographics and can win in both blue and purple states. Furthermore, Sanders has a passionate and dedicated base of supporters who are eager to turn out and vote for him. In 2016, he won over 13 million votes in the Democratic primary, and many of those supporters are still with him today. This grassroots enthusiasm could be a powerful force in the general election, especially if Sanders can mobilize young and working-class voters who are often overlooked by traditional campaigns. Another advantage for Sanders is his ability to appeal to independent voters. In many swing states, independent voters are a crucial voting bloc, and Sanders has a strong track record of winning their support. In the 2016 Democratic primary, he won a majority of independent voters in many states, including New Hampshire, Michigan, and Wisconsin. This suggests that he could be a strong candidate in states that Trump won in 2016, such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Of course, there are also some challenges that Sanders will need to overcome if he wants to win the nomination and defeat Trump. One of the biggest obstacles is the perception that he is too far to the left to win a general election. Many moderate Democrats and swing voters are wary of Sanders' democratic socialist views, and Republicans are sure to use this against him in attack ads. To counter this, Sanders will need to emphasize his pragmatic side and show that he can work with people across the political spectrum to get things done. He can point to his record of passing bipartisan legislation, such as the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act, which he co-authored with Republican Senator John McCain. Sanders can also make the case that his policies are actually quite popular with the American people. Polls consistently show that a majority of Americans support policies like Medicare for All, free college tuition, and a $15 minimum wage. By framing his policies as common-sense solutions to the problems facing working-class Americans, Sanders can appeal to a broad swath of voters who are tired of the status quo. Another challenge for Sanders is the perception that he is too old to be president. At 78 years old, he would be the oldest president ever elected if he were to win in 2020. This could be a liability, especially if he faces a younger and more energetic opponent in the general election. To address this, Sanders can emphasize his vitality and energy on the campaign trail. He can point to his rigorous travel schedule and his ability to draw large crowds at rallies across the country. He can also highlight his commitment to healthy living, such as his daily exercise routine and his vegetarian diet. Ultimately, the key to Sanders' success will be his ability to build a broad coalition of voters who are united by a common vision for the future. He will need to reach out to moderate Democrats, independent voters, and even some disaffected Republicans if he wants to win in November. But if he can do so, he could be the candidate who finally defeats Donald Trump and ushers in a new era of progressive politics in America.
