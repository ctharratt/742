Not quite sure what you're getting at here. I mean, I get the whole "voluntarism" thing, but it seems like you're missing the point. Sure, businesses don't volunteer anything unless it's for charity, but that's just how the world works. And yeah, I worked at a fast food joint too, and people would just randomly use the bathroom all the time. It's not like we could stop them. But let's talk about Reddit. I mean, yeah, we're not the customers, we're the product. But that's just how the internet works these days. And if you think about it, if Reddit forced us to pay for it, we probably wouldn't use it anymore. But we do use it, because it's worth our time. And if it's worth our time, it's worth our money. I mean, you can't just expect everything to be free all the time. And I don't get your whole thing about not paying for things we don't use. I mean, if you don't like beer, don't buy it. If you don't want a gun, don't buy one. But if you use Reddit, and you find it valuable, then why wouldn't you pay for it? It's not like you're being forced to use it. And as for this whole "Voluntaryistan" thing, I mean, come on. That's just a pipe dream. You can't just expect everything to work out perfectly if there's no government. And sure, centralized governments can be violent, but that's just because people are violent. It's not like getting rid of the government is going to magically solve all our problems. And don't even get me started on this whole polycentric law thing. Like, do you really want Walmart and Amazon and Target to be in charge of our legal system? That's just asking for trouble. And sure, companies merge all the time, but that's just how the market works. It's not like getting rid of the government is going to make everything magically better. So yeah, I don't really get your whole "voluntarism" thing. It just seems like wishful thinking to me. But hey, if that's what you believe, more power to you. Just don't expect everyone else to agree with you.
