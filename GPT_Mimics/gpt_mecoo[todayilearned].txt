I've been in the business of selling my homemade hot sauce for a few years now, and let me tell you, it's not as easy as it seems. Sure, I have a few loyal customers who can't get enough of my spicy concoction, but overall, it's a tough market to crack. One of the biggest challenges I face is actually selling all of my product before it goes bad. Hot sauce has a relatively long shelf life, but it's not indefinite. I've had to throw away gallons of my beloved sauce because I couldn't sell it in time. It's a heartbreaking experience, let me tell you. But I've learned a few tricks of the trade over the years. For example, I have a few old ladies who love to put my hot sauce in their nail polish. I know, it sounds crazy, but apparently, it gives their nails a fiery red color that they just can't get enough of. I also have a customer who buys my hot sauce to train his guard dog. He swears that the spicy scent helps to keep his dog alert and focused. Who knew? But even with these loyal customers, it's still a challenge to move an entire gallon of hot sauce. I've tried selling at local farmers' markets and food festivals, but the competition is fierce. There are so many other vendors selling their own hot sauces, and it's hard to stand out in the crowd. I've also tried selling online, but that comes with its own set of challenges. Shipping hot sauce can be tricky, and I've had a few bottles break in transit. Plus, there are so many other hot sauce brands available online, it's hard to get noticed. So, what's a hot sauce maker to do? Well, I've learned that the best way to sell my product is through word of mouth. I encourage my loyal customers to tell their friends and family about my hot sauce. I also offer discounts to customers who refer new business to me. It's a win-win situation. But there's another challenge that I face as a hot sauce maker, and it has nothing to do with selling my product. It's dealing with the so-called "social justice warriors" (SJWs) who seem to be everywhere these days. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm all for social justice and equality. But some of these SJWs take things to the extreme. They see everything as a black or white issue, and if you don't agree with them 100%, you're labeled as an oppressor. I've had a few run-ins with SJWs on social media, and let me tell you, it's not a pleasant experience. They're quick to jump on any perceived slight, and they're not afraid to use insults and name-calling to get their point across. One time, I made a joke about a popular SJW term, and I was immediately attacked by a group of them. They accused me of being a "cis-scum" and a "white supremacist." They even threatened to boycott my hot sauce because of my "offensive" joke. It was ridiculous, but I didn't let it get to me. I've learned that the best way to deal with these types of situations is to turn it into a joke. After all, laughter is the best medicine, right? So, I came up with a ridiculous response to their insults. I pretended to be a "gorilla-kin" with a "headmate" named Swiper from Dora the Explorer. I listed off a bunch of ridiculous "triggers" and threatened to "shit pronouns" all over them. It was silly, but it worked. The SJWs were so confused by my response that they didn't know how to react. They eventually gave up and moved on to their next target. Now, I'm not saying that we should make light of serious social justice issues. But sometimes, it's important to take a step back and realize that not everything is a life or death situation. Sometimes, it's okay to laugh at ourselves and our differences. In conclusion, selling hot sauce is not an easy business. It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to make a product that people love. But with a little creativity and a lot of perseverance, it's possible to make a name for yourself in the hot sauce world. And as for dealing with SJWs, well, sometimes you just have to laugh it off. Life is too short to take everything so seriously. So, let's all enjoy a spicy bowl of chili and raise a glass to the power of laughter.
