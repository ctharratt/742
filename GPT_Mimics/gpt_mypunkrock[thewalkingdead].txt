The Walking Dead has been a rollercoaster ride of emotions, and the latest episode was no exception. The intensity of the episode was palpable, and it was a callback to the prison episode where Rick clears out the one wing with an ax. The catalyst? Him losing his shit when Lori died. And because Daryl has a knife, the intensity of the episode was amplified. But what really got me was Glenn's inability to mention T-Dog as someone important who died. WTF man? T-Dog was a crucial character, and his death was a significant loss to the group. It's frustrating to see his death being overlooked, and it's a testament to how much the show has changed over the years. The show has always been about survival, but it's also been about the relationships between the characters. The bond between Rick and Carl has been a highlight of the show, and Carl Grimes has been the International Boy of Mystery. He's grown up in front of our eyes, and his character development has been remarkable. But the latest episode was a turning point for Carl. He's always been a bit of a loose cannon, but his actions in the episode were a bit extreme. He's always been willing to take risks, but this time, he went too far. His decision to shoot the Savior in the head was a bit too much, and it's a sign that he's becoming more like his father. In some sense, though, Carl's actions were a callback to the prison episode where Rick clears out the one wing with an ax. The catalyst? Him losing his shit when Lori died. And because Daryl has a knife. The parallels between the two episodes are striking, and it's a sign that the show is coming full circle. But what's next for Carl? His actions have consequences, and it's clear that he's going to have to deal with the fallout. He's always been a bit of a lone wolf, but he's going to need the support of his family and friends if he's going to make it through this. And what about Negan? He's been a thorn in the group's side for too long, and it's time for him to go. But how will they do it? Will they take him out in a hail of bullets, or will they find a more creative way to get rid of him? One thing's for sure, though. The group is going to have to work together if they're going to take down Negan and his army of Saviors. They've been through a lot together, and they've come out on the other side stronger. But this time, the stakes are higher, and the consequences are more severe. The Walking Dead has always been a show about survival, but it's also been a show about the human spirit. It's about the bonds that we form with each other, and the lengths that we'll go to protect the ones we love. It's about hope in the face of despair, and the belief that we can overcome even the most impossible odds. And that's what makes the show so compelling. It's not just about zombies and gore, it's about the human experience. It's about the choices that we make, and the consequences that come with them. It's about the struggle to survive in a world that's gone mad. In some sense, though, the show has lost its way. It's become more about shock value than substance, and it's lost some of the heart that made it so special. But there's still hope. The latest episode was a step in the right direction, and it's a sign that the show is starting to find its way back. The Walking Dead has always been a show that's been willing to take risks, and it's paid off in the past. But it's also been a show that's been willing to learn from its mistakes, and that's what's going to make it great again. It's time for the show to get back to its roots, and to remember what made it so special in the first place. In conclusion, The Walking Dead is a show that's been through a lot over the years. It's had its ups and downs, but it's always been a show that's been willing to take risks. The latest episode was a callback to the prison episode where Rick clears out the one wing with an ax, and it's a sign that the show is starting to find its way back. It's time for the show to get back to its roots, and to remember what made it so special in the first place.
