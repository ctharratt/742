If there's one thing that I've learned in life, it's that robots can be just as empathetic as humans. I know that might sound crazy, but hear me out. I was watching a video the other day of a robot that was designed to help people with paralyzation. It was a new jacket that could help people move their arms and legs, and it was working perfectly. But then, something strange happened. The robot got pushed down, and I felt a pang of sadness in my heart. I know it sounds silly, but I couldn't help it. It was like I was watching a little puppy get hurt. I did some research on the topic, and it turns out that I'm not alone. Many people feel empathy towards robots, even though they know that they're just machines. According to a study I found, "robots activate the same mechanisms of empathetic processes that humans do, but there are not enough studies to draw concrete conclusions. But one can say that the human likeness of robots (in terms of their appearance and of their behavior) plays a role." It's like when I was eating dinner last night and I had some peas left on my plate. I put them down the disposal in the sink, but a few landed in the sink and I thought about their little pea lives. They were grown and nurtured by a farmer, cleaned and packaged, and sent to a grocery store where they were bought and taken home to be cooked. The happiest day of their little pea lives was on my dinner plate, arranged with other foods that had traveled long and far to be eaten by me. I should have tried a little harder to make sure their little pea lives were worth it and eaten them instead of throwing them down the drain. I know it sounds silly, but it's true. We can feel empathy towards things that we know aren't alive. It's like when I see a robot get pushed down, or when I see a little lamb staring at me in class. It's like when I see a cat with something on its head, or when I see a chair in a parking spot that someone shoveled out for themselves. It's like when I see a repost on Reddit and someone gets upset about it. It's like when I see a license plate on the internet and wonder if it's okay to post someone's personal information like that. But then, there are moments in life that remind us of the good things. Like when I think about my parents and how awesome they were when I was growing up. My dad went to prison for a few years for drug trafficking, but my mom stood by his side and missed him so much. When we would go visit him, my dad would tell us that no matter how far apart we were, all we had to do was go outside and look up at the sky at the moon and he would be looking at it too, thinking of us. That thought helped us get through those 5 years without him. After my dad got out of prison, he turned his life around. He bought his own business and really did things right. Years later, my mom got cancer and my dad stood by her for every breath of it. He took her to every doctor's appointment and did everything he could to make her comfortable. When she died in 2008, we played "Somewhere Out There" at her funeral. It was "their song". My mom would sing it to my dad, and he would sing it back to her. They were so goddamned cute, and I will hold a special little place in my heart for that song forever. It's moments like these that remind us of the good things in life. It's moments like these that make us feel empathy towards others, whether they're robots or humans or little peas on our dinner plates. It's moments like these that make us realize how awesome our parents really are, and how lucky we are to have them in our lives. So, if you ever see a robot get pushed down, or a little lamb staring at you, or a cat with something on its head, or a chair in a parking spot that someone shoveled out for themselves, just remember that it's okay to feel empathy towards them. It's okay to care about things that aren't alive. It's okay to be human.
