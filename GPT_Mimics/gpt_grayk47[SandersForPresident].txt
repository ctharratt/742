I don't know about you, but I'm tired of all this political nonsense. It seems like every time I turn on the TV or open up my news app, there's some new scandal or controversy. And don't even get me started on social media. It's like everyone thinks they're a political expert these days. But you know what really grinds my gears? Foreigners telling us who to vote for. I mean, come on. We're Americans. We know what's best for our country. We don't need some outsider coming in and trying to sway our opinions. Now, I'm not saying that we should interfere with other countries' democratic processes. That's not our place. But we should be able to make our own decisions without outside influence. And let's be real here, when the world needs a superhero, who do they turn to? The United States. Despite all our flaws and mistakes, we're still seen as a global force that can protect the little guy when called to action. It's not Russia or China that people ask for help from. It's us. Now, I know some people might say that there's a clear difference between Hitler and Kissinger. And they're right. Hitler used pseudo-history and pseudo-science to spew racial bullshit that highlighted the German psyche following the end of WWI. Kissinger, on the other hand, may be a terrible person, but he's perhaps the most efficient and accomplished Secretary of State in modern US history. You have to ask yourself, why do people still respect him despite his controversial policies? When you understand why people still listen to and respect the wisdom and theories of Kissinger, then you'll understand why he's considered a great Secretary of State in terms of achievements. Now, I'm not defending the man. I'm simply stating that there's a deserved reason why people respect him still in terms of international relations. It's not that anyone who doesn't work as an expert for the State Department is an ignoramus. It's that there's a level of understanding that a person who understands the world and how hundreds of individual sovereign states interact with one another comes to accept the fact that sometimes it takes bad men to do bad things to further the interests of one nation. Otherwise, bad men from other countries will do bad things in the name of that nation. The world isn't black and white. Now, I know some people might view Kissinger as a bad person, and that's their prerogative. But I don't know a single person who works as an expert in international relations for the US government who doesn't at least give Kissinger some of their attention. My uncle, who worked for the State Department for 29 years, believes that Kissinger is a terrible person. But you know what? He's bought and read all of Kissinger's books because the man is simply a genius. You can recognize a person for being terrible but also acknowledge their wisdom and genius. Kissinger is an interesting guy in terms of the legacy he left and how he's perceived by the general public and those who are involved in geopolitics professionally as experts working for the State Department or DC firms. When viewed by the general public, the man might as well be the devil. And not to say that the ire he's received over the decades is not deserved or unexpected. He was at the center of some very controversial policy shifts. But when you go to an international relations expert who has real-world experience dealing with relations between other countries and the US, the theories that Kissinger holds on international relations and China begin to make a great deal of sense. He perfected realpolitik international relations. Now, I know some people might say that we should only have good people in government. But the truth is, sometimes it takes bad people to do bad things to further the interests of one nation. It's not ideal, but it's the reality of the world we live in. And that's why the revolving door between the public and private sectors can be both a great thing and a bad thing. On the one hand, you often get the best people with practical experience helping government become more efficient (theoretically). But on the other hand, you can also get corruption. I view Hillary's potential presidency as a continuance and improvement of the Obama presidency, at least when it comes to foreign policy. So I honestly think that starting a war is not in Hillary's agenda (barring a major terrorist attack or a shoot-out with China in the SCS). She'll seek to maintain the US hegemony in the world through the use of soft power rather than through military force. Now, I know some people might say that Bernie's naivete is a little disconcerting. And to be honest, on a theoretical level, I can see where they're coming from. The truth is, if America doesn't project its power through soft power, someone else who is less savory like Russia or China will. In a perfect world, America would work with the rest of the UN permanent 5 to bolster the UN's power in the ability to intervene, and together the UN 5 could lead the world through policy. But we don't live in a perfect world. We live in a world where politics ages people unnaturally. I mean, what's that saying? Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...nothing has changed in my eyes, nothing will change. I'll vote for Sanders because I like many of his platforms, but I'm done with revolutions. And if he wins, it'll only take about a year or two before the disappointment sets in and reality kicks in. Even Obama, who had control of the House in 2008 until 2010, was seen as a disappointment by liberals. Well, it's interesting because most of the people I know who are supporting Sanders are very progressive. So they find Hillary's and Obama's left-centrist policies not good enough. Or they're people who weren't around when Obama first ran in 2008. But you know what? I'm tired of all this political nonsense. I just want to live my life and not have to worry about who's in charge. Is that too much to ask?
