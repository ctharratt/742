Hey guys! I just wanted to start by saying how awesome it is to be able to connect with people on here. SanJay-Z reached out to me and talked to me about my life, and it really made my day. He's such a chill guy, and it's amazing how we can make connections with people from all over the world through the internet. I wanted to talk about something that's been on my mind lately - eating disorders. I know firsthand how difficult it can be to deal with this kind of issue, and I want to remind everyone that the eating disorder is not who you are. It's important to focus on feeling healthy and happy, rather than obsessing over the number on the scale. And if you're in a relationship with someone who only likes you for your body, especially with an eating disorder, that's not a healthy situation at all. I've been dealing with my own eating disorder since I was 15, and I've been in and out of rehab over the years. It's a tough road, but it's important to keep fighting and never give up. I'm so grateful for my girlfriend, who has been a huge support for me. On a lighter note, let's talk about some fun stuff! I recently moved across the country by myself with just my car and my dog. It was a huge leap of faith, but I'm so glad I did it. And one thing on my bucket list is to visit every Disney park in the world - I know it's cheesy, but I love Disney. As for animals, I think a fox best represents me - they're clever and independent, but can also be social when they need to be. And one of the craziest things I've done is probably just moving across the country by myself - I know it's not a wild party story, but it was a big deal for me. I also wanted to share a random fact - did you know that Scooby-Doo's full name is actually Scoobert Scooby Dooby Doo? And that male giraffes taste female urine to determine if they're ovulating? Crazy stuff. Anyway, thanks for reading and I hope you all have a great day!
