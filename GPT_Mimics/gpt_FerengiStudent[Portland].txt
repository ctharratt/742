An aside: I've been thinking a lot about the housing crisis in Portland lately. It's a complex issue with no easy solutions, but I believe there are some steps we can take to alleviate the problem. First and foremost, we need to address the lack of affordable housing. This means not only building more units, but also ensuring that those units are priced within reach of low- and middle-income families. One way to do this is through public housing, which has been successful in other cities. Yes, there have been problems with public housing in the past, but that doesn't mean we should give up on it altogether. We just need to do it right this time. Another solution is to encourage developers to build taller buildings. Right now, there are too many single-family homes in the interior East, which takes up valuable space that could be used for multi-family housing. By allowing taller buildings, we can increase the number of units available without taking up more land. Of course, building more housing won't solve the problem if people can't afford to live in it. That's why we need to raise the minimum wage and tie it to inflation. It's not fair that people who work full-time can't afford basic necessities like housing and healthcare. A living wage isn't just progressive, it's common sense. But even if we raise the minimum wage, there will still be people who can't afford housing. That's where public services come in. We need to provide integrated social services to help people get back on their feet. This could include job training, mental health services, and addiction treatment. By addressing the root causes of homelessness, we can help people get back on their feet and become self-sufficient. Of course, all of this costs money. But I believe that investing in our communities is worth it. We can't just sit back and watch as people struggle to make ends meet. We need to take action and do what we can to help. One way to fund these initiatives is through a tax on luxury apartments and condos. Right now, developers are building high-end units that only the wealthy can afford. By taxing these units, we can generate revenue that can be used to fund affordable housing and social services. Another way to fund these initiatives is through a tax on corporations that pay their employees poverty wages. It's not fair that private corporations are abusing Oregon for cheap labor and then making the rest of us pay for the inevitable social services that the employees need. By holding these corporations accountable, we can ensure that they pay their fair share and contribute to the well-being of our communities. But even with these solutions in place, there will still be people who fall through the cracks. That's why we need to support nonprofits that help the homeless. These organizations provide vital services like food, shelter, and medical care. We can't just rely on the government to solve all of our problems. We need to work together as a community to help those in need. Of course, there will always be naysayers who argue that we can't afford to help the homeless. But the truth is, we can't afford not to. Homelessness is a crisis that affects us all. It's not just a moral issue, it's an economic issue. When people are homeless, they can't contribute to the economy. They can't work, they can't pay taxes, and they can't buy goods and services. By helping the homeless, we're not just doing the right thing, we're also investing in our future. In conclusion, the housing crisis in Portland is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. We need to build more affordable housing, raise the minimum wage, provide integrated social services, tax luxury apartments and condos, hold corporations accountable, and support nonprofits that help the homeless. It won't be easy, but it's necessary if we want to create a more just and equitable society.
