The world is changing rapidly, and it seems like the leaders of many countries are struggling to keep up. From the Middle East to Europe, there are a lot of issues that need to be addressed, but it seems like many leaders are more concerned with political correctness than actually solving problems. One of the biggest issues facing Europe right now is the massive influx of migrants from Africa and the Middle East. The population of Africa is expected to balloon to nearly 4 billion by the end of this century, while Europe's population will only be around 500 million. Many of these people will flood Europe by the tens of millions every year, and it doesn't take a scientist to understand that Europeans will become outnumbered in their own countries within a few decades with migration levels that high. Things are going to only get much, much worse for Europe unless they do something about it. Unfortunately, it seems like many European leaders are more concerned with appearing politically correct than actually solving the problem. Angela Merkel's plan to deport all these people to fix the situation in Europe is now a giant failure. The hardest part will be deporting those that came in illegally, and it's doubtful they will go willingly for breaking our laws. It's not just Europe that's struggling with these issues. The Middle East is also facing a lot of problems, and it seems like many leaders are more concerned with playing political games than actually solving them. The Saudis are turning on the pumps because OPEC is defunct. So many members cheated on their quotas which hurt the Saudis that the Saudis said enough is enough, we are going to pump all that we want and to hell with OPEC because they keep burning us. It's sad that what is going on in Syria is a giant game of chess between Saudi Arabia and Iran with the Saudis supporting groups like ISIS and the Iranians supporting Assad. Clearly, the situation in the Middle East is complex, but it seems like many leaders are more concerned with their own interests than actually solving the problems. One of the biggest issues facing the world right now is the rise of political correctness and the left's obsession with regulating absolutely everything. It seems like no one in power understands how the internet works or how nearly impossible it is to monitor all links for infringing material, especially as a site gets larger. The EU's leaders can sometimes be completely incompetent, and their obsession with political correctness is tearing apart the EU. SJWs are like an aggressive cancer, they spread like wildfire destroying everything until they kill the host. You have to fight such a cancer aggressively to stop its spread before it is too late. The left's biggest fear is that the Rotherham proved that the right was correct about what they have been saying for years and that this will give politically right-leaning parties fuel to grow in power. Their biggest concern isn't that over 1,000 children were raped, the left is more concerned with not appearing racist and not allowing the political right to be able to say "I told you so." The pendulum has swung way too far left in Europe, and it is starting to swing right again as people are getting fed up with the left. It would be nice to see Germany grow a spine against political correctness and multiculturalism. This nonsense is tearing apart the EU. It's not just Europe that's struggling with political correctness. In the US, the left is also obsessed with it. When we say Asian, we typically think Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Thai, etc. These were not Japanese men who committed this crime. In fact, I don't think any European country has any major problems with east Asians such as the Japanese or the Koreans. The rise of political correctness is also affecting the way we talk about science. The Chinese built a tokamak type reactor while the Germans built a stellarator type. We have been building large tokamak reactors for decades because they are easy to build. Large stellarator type reactors are much more difficult to build, and one of this size has never been built. The Chinese may have built a tokamak type reactor, but they didn't surpass Germany. There weren't even in competition to begin with. It's not just political correctness that's affecting the way we talk about science. It seems like many people don't understand how science works. Muhammadu Buhari, the President of Nigeria, is not secretly a racist White man. He is simply saying the same thing as the people in the UK who are labeled as being racist White supremacists by the left. It's important to understand the facts before making accusations. Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of Commission for Racial Equality, recently did a TV special on the dangers of political correctness. Here is a link to that special, and it is very informative. It uses facts and data to confirm a lot about what we suspected about modern society but were too afraid to say. It's time for leaders around the world to start focusing on solving problems instead of playing political games and worrying about political correctness. The world is changing rapidly, and we need leaders who can keep up.
