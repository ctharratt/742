Hey there, it seems like you've got a lot of great ideas for your Fate campaign! I agree that simplifying calculations and presenting reasonable challenges is key to keeping players engaged and invested in the game. Treating a group of mooks as a single character is a great way to achieve this, and I think it's a smart move to have two or more groups team up for a bonus if the situation warrants it. I also appreciate your thoughts on mental conflicts and how close relationships can cause the most damage. It's true that rocky family relationships can ruin your day and cause lasting psychological scars, and it's important to consider this when designing conflicts in your game. I think the Caring Heart stunt is a great addition to your game, and it's cool that it allows players to use Empathy to calculate Mental Stress instead of Will. Regarding the Burglary skill, I agree that it's pretty narrow if you remove hacking and security locks. Folding the remaining bit (stealing things) into Stealth or Deceive is a good idea, and it makes sense in the context of a narrative-based game like Fate. I also like your idea of allowing a mage to use Craft (or relevant skill) to create a fortress in a turn. The question of what the mechanical effect in the game is a good one, and I think your suggestion of adding Earthen Fortress to the scene as a situation aspect that players can invoke to add +2 to defense is a smart move. Success with style adding free invokes as usual is also a nice touch. I'm not fond of extra stress tracks either, and I think it's usually better to achieve the same goal by asking what you're trying to achieve. In this case, it seems like the goal is to limit the number of spells down, and I think that's a reasonable approach. Some of the concepts you've mentioned, like Shape Earth, don't seem any more effective than a standard skill roll or don't achieve anything in terms of Fate mechanics. However, I think the Fate Freeport Companion's D&D-based magic system could help you refine your system, and it's definitely worth checking out. I also like your ideas for stunts related to Internal Affairs and other skills. Electronic Surveillance, Televangelists, Labor Day, Peace Accords, Grain Belt, Totalitarian Regime, Scorched Earth, Special Ops Teams, and Air Superiority all sound like great additions to your game, and I think they'll add a lot of depth and complexity to your campaign. Finally, I think it's great that you're planning scenes and themes ahead of time in Fate. It gives you something to work with and can fill in when no one else supplies ideas, and it's easier to revise something that's already written than to create everything from scratch. However, it's important not to be married to these plans and to be open to improvisation and collaboration with your players. Overall, it seems like you're on the right track with your Fate campaign, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here. Good luck, and happy gaming!
