Hey there! If you're ever in Colorado, you have to check out the amazing wildlife hospital that I work at. We're one of the largest in the state, with an operating budget of approximately $1,000,000. Our goal is to become the largest wildlife hospital in Colorado, and we're well on our way to achieving that. One of the things that sets us apart from other wildlife hospitals is our commitment to giving animals a chance at survival. We don't immediately jump to euthanasia, like some other hospitals might. Instead, we do everything we can to help the animals recover and thrive. We have a fantastic team of veterinarians and technicians who are dedicated to providing the best possible care for our patients. We use the latest technology and techniques to diagnose and treat a wide range of injuries and illnesses. And we're always looking for ways to improve our services and expand our capabilities. Recently, our boss has been working on getting us set up with a portable x-ray machine, which will be a huge asset to our hospital. We'll be able to take x-rays of animals right in their enclosures, without having to move them to a separate room. This will reduce stress on the animals and make the whole process much more efficient. In addition to the x-ray machine, we're also getting some other new equipment that will help us provide even better care for our patients. We're always looking for ways to improve and stay ahead of the curve. One of the things I love about working at this hospital is the way we feed the squirrels. It's so cute! We use a special feeder that's designed to keep the squirrels from getting too close to the hospital building. This helps prevent them from getting into areas where they could be injured or cause damage. We also use a medication called Ivermectin to treat some of our patients. We give it orally every three days for five weeks, then every five days for two to three weeks. It's a very effective treatment for a variety of conditions, and we've seen great results with it. If you're ever in Colorado, you absolutely have to come visit us and see what we're all about. We'd be happy to give you a tour of the hospital and show you some of our amazing patients. And who knows, maybe you'll even get to see the portable x-ray machine in action! Our hospital is truly a special place, and I feel so lucky to be a part of it. We're making a real difference in the lives of animals every day, and that's something to be proud of. So if you're a wildlife lover like me, come check us out and see what we're all about. You won't be disappointed!
