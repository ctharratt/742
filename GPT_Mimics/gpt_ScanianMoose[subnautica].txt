Hey there fellow Subnautica players! Today, I want to talk about some tips and tricks for exploring the game's vast underwater world. Whether you're a seasoned player or just starting out, these tips will help you navigate the depths and find all the hidden treasures that Subnautica has to offer. First off, let's talk about the Aurora. This massive spaceship is the centerpiece of the game's story and is where you'll find many important items and blueprints. However, it's also a dangerous place to be, as the ship is heavily damaged and full of radiation. So, how do you safely explore the Aurora? The key is to wait for it to explode. Once the Aurora explodes, head to the Grassy Plateaus towards the north (not SE). The wreck will have the Fragment at the very bottom. Pack at least two tanks and a laser cutter. This will allow you to cut through the wreckage and access all the important areas. Just be sure to watch out for any dangerous creatures that may be lurking around. Next up, let's talk about aquariums. These are a great way to keep your fish and other sea creatures safe and contained. However, it's important to note that the large aquarium has a limit of 10 fish per large aquarium (stacking them will add more). So, if you want to keep more than 10 fish, you'll need to build multiple aquariums. Additionally, be sure to get rid of all that salt from the water filtration machines. This role will be taken by the LED Light / Lightstick, which is battery-powered. You can find its Fragment in the Koosh Zone Wreck. That has been there for a year or more now. It just hasn't been cleaned up yet. The texture is that of the Inactive Lava Zone, which you can reach already (deep down, though). Now, let's talk about crashes. Unfortunately, some players may experience crashes or missing fragments while playing Subnautica. If you're having trouble with crashes, try updating your graphics driver or adjusting your graphics settings. Additionally, some fragments that are being worked on may be missing (and you may have to acquire the blueprints resulting from all the new fragments anew). However, if you're keen on having all the latest stuff - experimental graphics settings, planters, new plants, abandoned seabases, wrecks, new gadgets and the like - go on experimental. Even if it does, a Welder is cheap to come by. Speaking of abandoned seabases, these are a great place to find rare items and blueprints. However, they can be difficult to locate and access. One of the people who established the abandoned seabases claims that his ship was also shot down. Yeah, I only noticed that one now ^^ On my first visit, I only saw the one at the very top of the Seabase, which you cannot reach without building a structure. We're trying our best to keep up. Just go and see whether the Seabases are there in an old save. But how does one get on top of that Seabase in order to scan the spotlight? All three of them? The only one I found was the one on the right - but then again, I haven't searched the wrecks in quite some time. If so, the Posters page on the wiki needs to be updated. freecam will show us. IIRC at the moment, you don't even have a head in Freecam. The Docking Bay one does not seem to be in the game as it stands. However, it may be out of date due to the changes made to the Fragment spawns. Some info is simply missing. Take a look at the abandoned seabase in Experimental, you'll find something that might interest you :) There's more on it in the translation files. Read the sidebar. Finally, let's talk about some of the new items and blueprints that have been added to the game recently. These include the Cargo Crate, Chair, Desk, Monitor, Circuit box, Bulkhead Fragment, Base Filtration Fragment, Observatory Fragment, Seamoth Upgrade Console Fragment, Mobile Vehicle Bay Fragment, Power Transmitter Fragment, Radio Fragment (/Communication Relay Fragment), Scanner Room Fragment, Seaglide Fragment, Solar Panel Fragment, Specimen Analyzer Fragment, Cyclops Bridge Fragment, Cyclops Docking Bay Fragment, Cyclops Engine Fragment, and Cyclops Hull Fragment. Additionally, there are six new posters that will be added to the game soon. You can still spawn them in with console commands. Well, that's all for now. I hope these tips and tricks help you explore the underwater world of Subnautica and find all the hidden treasures that await you. Happy diving!
