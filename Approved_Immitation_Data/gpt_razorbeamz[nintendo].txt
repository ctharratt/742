Alright, let's talk about something that's been bothering me for a while now. It's the issue of localization in video games, specifically when it comes to dialogue. I've seen a lot of people defend the practice of writing over dialogue with nothing but "..." and I just can't understand it. To me, that's not localization, it's laziness. Now, I understand that there are limitations when it comes to translating dialogue from one language to another. Sometimes certain phrases or jokes just don't translate well, and it can be difficult to find an equivalent that works in the target language. But that's not an excuse to just leave the dialogue blank or with ellipses. I've seen this happen in a lot of games, but one recent example that comes to mind is the localization of Fire Emblem Fates. In the Japanese version of the game, there's a character named Soleil who is attracted to women. However, in the English version, her dialogue was changed to make it seem like she's just really friendly with other women. This change was made because the original dialogue was seen as potentially offensive to some players. Now, I understand the reasoning behind this change. It's important to be sensitive to different cultures and beliefs, and to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes. But the way it was handled in this case was just lazy. Instead of finding a way to translate the dialogue that kept the character's original personality intact, they just wrote over it with ellipses. It's a cop-out, plain and simple. And it's not just Fire Emblem Fates. I've seen this happen in other games as well, where entire sections of dialogue are just left blank or with ellipses. It's frustrating as a player, because it feels like you're missing out on something. And it's disrespectful to the original creators of the game, who put a lot of time and effort into crafting the dialogue. Now, I'm not saying that every game needs to have perfect localization. There will always be some things that get lost in translation, and that's okay. But when it comes to dialogue, there's no excuse for laziness. If you're going to change something, do it in a way that respects the original intent of the creators and keeps the character's personality intact. I think part of the problem is that localization is often seen as an afterthought. It's something that gets tacked on at the end of development, rather than being an integral part of the process. But if we want to see better localization in games, we need to start treating it as a priority. One way to do this is to involve more people in the localization process. This could include translators, writers, and even players themselves. By getting input from a variety of sources, we can ensure that the localization is as accurate and respectful as possible. Another way to improve localization is to give it more time and resources. Instead of rushing to get a game out the door, developers should take the time to carefully craft the dialogue and make sure it's translated properly. This might mean delaying the release of a game, but I think most players would be willing to wait if it meant getting a better product in the end. Ultimately, I think the issue of localization in video games is something that needs to be taken seriously. It's not just a matter of translating words from one language to another; it's about respecting different cultures and beliefs, and making sure that players get the best possible experience. So let's start treating localization as the important task that it is, and work to improve it in every game.
