Windows updates can be a real pain, especially if you have an older hard drive that isn't performing as well as it used to. It's not uncommon for updates to get stuck for an hour or more, and the thought of starting over can be daunting. That's why it's important to be patient and wait as long as possible before attempting to restart the update process. If you're updating your system, it's best to do all the updates at once. However, be careful not to select any optional updates, don't install anything, and don't enable Microsoft Updates if your updates are that out of date. Just let everything complete with just important updates until you've spent around six hours updating and rebooted around 15 times. Once everything is up to date, then you can consider other optional updates. Otherwise, you may get stuck in Windows' famous update loop of death, which can be frustrating and time-consuming. It's not uncommon for Windows updates to fail, and when they do, you may see a message that says "rolling back updates." This can take up to 20 hours, so it's best to avoid this situation altogether by being patient and allowing the updates to complete without interruption. If you're experiencing slow performance or your hard drive is constantly running, it's a good idea to open Task Manager and look for the resource monitor button. This will show you which app is using up your hard drive usage. It's likely that scans, updates, or the collection of spy data is causing the issue. If nothing sticks out as eating up your HDD usage, then it's time for a full disk fitness scan. When it comes to updating your drivers, it's important to remember that your motherboard drivers never really need to be updated unless you have a problem with new hardware working. Your GPU drivers, on the other hand, should be updated manually and directly from the manufacturer's website. This should be done about once every six months, or when you purchase a new graphics-intensive game to ensure that it works at the best of its ability. For the most part, if everything works, driver updates are not needed. If you're having trouble with your BIOS, it's possible that your CMOS battery is low or dead. This can result in repeated corruption of your BIOS data every time you shut down your computer. To fix this, you may need to replace the CMOS battery and clear the CMOS. If you're experiencing no video but can navigate into Windows by memory, it's possible that your BIOS is defaulting to the wrong video output. You can confirm this by connecting the on-board video to a monitor. If this is the case, you'll need to select an on-board versus PCI-E graphics option in the BIOS. When it comes to software, it's important to remember that you never really own the software you purchase. This is especially true with Windows 10, which is known for uninstalling user programs without permission. It's also important to be careful when downloading and opening files, as they may contain malware or viruses. If you're experiencing slow performance or your computer is acting strangely, it's possible that you have malware or a virus. Malwarebytes and antivirus software can help, but they're not foolproof. The best way to find out if you have malware or a virus is to catch it in the act and see what process is causing the issue. This can be done using Task Manager and Performance Monitor. If you're having trouble with your Ethernet connection, it's important to remember that cheaper doesn't always mean better. There are many products that claim to convert serial to RJ45 cables, but they're not always reliable. It's important to look for a TCP/IP Ethernet to RS232 converter that includes the proper protocols, not just the connector. In conclusion, Windows updates can be frustrating, but it's important to be patient and allow them to complete without interruption. When it comes to updating your drivers, it's best to stick with the manufacturer's website and only update when necessary. If you're experiencing issues with your BIOS or Ethernet connection, it's important to seek professional help to avoid causing further damage. And always be careful when downloading and opening files, as they may contain malware or viruses.
