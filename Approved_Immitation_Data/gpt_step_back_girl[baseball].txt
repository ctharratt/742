As a baseball fan, I have always been fascinated by the DH rule. It has been a part of the game for as long as I can remember, and yet, there are still debates about its merits and drawbacks. Some people love it, while others hate it. Personally, I don't really care either way. I just love baseball, and I'm happy to watch it played with or without the DH. One thing that struck me while watching the game is how much the DH rule affects interleague match-ups. It adds an interesting caveat to the game, and it's always fun to see how different teams approach it. Some teams use the DH as an opportunity to rest their pitchers, while others use it to add more power to their lineup. It's fascinating to see how different teams approach the same rule. Another thing that I love about baseball is the history behind it. There are so many great stories and moments that have happened over the years, and it's always fun to learn more about them. One of my favorite moments from this inning was hearing the story of Merkle's Boner and the resulting pennant loss. It's a story that I've known about for as long as I can remember, but I can't recall the first time I heard about it. As I was watching it, I realized that I didn't know it in detail. That was some great storytelling! I also enjoyed hearing from some of the interviewees in this inning. Shelby Foote at the beginning of the episode had a great quote, and Vin Scully is always a pleasure to listen to. It's amazing to hear from people who have been a part of the game for so long and have so much knowledge and experience to share. One fact that stuck with me from this inning is that food and drinks have been overpriced at ballparks since the 1850s. It's funny to think that this is a problem that has been around for so long. It's also interesting to see how much the game has changed over the years, while some things have stayed the same. As a Braves fan, I have many fond memories of going to games with my sister. We would always sneak off and drive around hoping to see Chipper. I can't recall one game that I would consider my favorite, other than a doubleheader against the Cubs in 2005 that I skipped my summer classes for. My sister called an hour before the game started to tell me she had found tickets. I made it from Athens (UGA) in the first inning of the first game. That was my first time attending a game that Smoltzie pitched, and we won both games that day. That was awesome. I also have fond memories of the I-70 Series games at Kauffman. The fans and atmosphere were just incredible with that rivalry, and at my second one in 2011, a pretty creative Missourian showed up with a half KC/half Cards uniform... Combining Butler and Pujols. ButJols. I laughed for days. As a fan, it's always tough to watch your team lose. The World Series can be especially tough, as the stakes are so high. It's easy to get caught up in the drama and emotion of the game. This series has had so much drama, and it's been a rollercoaster of emotions for both teams and their fans. One thing that I find frustrating as a fan is when people blame one player for a loss. Baseball is a team sport, and it takes a team effort to win or lose a game. It's unfair to put all the blame on one person, especially when there are so many factors that go into a game. At the end of the day, baseball is just a game. It's meant to be enjoyed and appreciated for what it is. Whether your team wins or loses, it's important to remember that there's always another game to be played. As a fan, it's important to support your team through the ups and downs, and to appreciate the history and tradition of the game. In conclusion, I love baseball. I love the DH rule, the history behind the game, and the memories that I have as a fan. I love the drama and emotion of the World Series, and the rollercoaster of emotions that comes with it. Most of all, I love the sense of community and camaraderie that comes with being a fan. Baseball is more than just a game; it's a way of life.
