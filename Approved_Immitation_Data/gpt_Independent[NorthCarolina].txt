In North Carolina, we have a saying that goes, "If you don't like the weather, wait a few hours, it will change." This is why I always make sure to have clothing appropriate for 30-70 degrees in my car from fall to spring. It's always better to be prepared for any weather changes that may occur. There is also a prevalent idea, whether it's an old farmer's tale or meteorologically sound, that severe weather in February leaves so much energy in the systems that severe cold often follows winter tornadoes a week apart. It may sound like hooey, but when you think about it in terms of deflecting the arctic air stream south with low pressure systems, it starts to make sense. On a different note, I recently came across a post on /r/androgyny about Sean Haugh, a political candidate. I actually met him several election cycles ago when he was running for something else. People often talk about candidates they'd like to have a beer with, and while I won't vote for Sean, I'll buy him a beer anytime. The problem is that he doesn't have serious competition, which is a shame. Speaking of politics, I believe that we need to find political solutions that are not based on bullshit that does not work. It's frustrating to see politicians make promises they can't keep and use distorted statistical data to support their claims. We need to hold them accountable and demand better from our leaders. One issue that I believe needs to be addressed is the welfare system. Instead of continually force-feeding the military industrial complex and the private prison complex, we should be investing in our citizens. Imagine if we took all the money wasted on wars of choice, propping up and then toppling puppet dictators, and fighting the failed war on drugs, and instead divided it up equally in a trust fund for every US citizen. Alaska and Norway do something like that with oil revenue taxes, and it's time for the rest of the country to follow suit. Of course, there will always be those who cannot work for a whole variety of reasons, from disability to mental illness to age, to having had their jobs outsourced, etc. There is basically no moral way to structure a society without some form of assistance. However, we need to make sure that the assistance we provide is effective and helps people get back on their feet. Rehab programs for those struggling with substance abuse or behavioral problems can be a path out of assistance and into the workforce. Unfortunately, the US has a failed war on drugs and a punitive mindset that does nothing but enrich the private testing companies and private prisons without addressing the problem at all. We need to focus on getting people the help they need instead of punishing them for their struggles. In terms of design, I recently saw the new North Carolina license plate design. While I prefer it to the contentious "First in Flight" slogan, I still think the original logo is a graphic design trainwreck from a business printing standpoint. It's not good graphic design and doesn't scale well. However, it looks a lot better as a license plate than as a logo primarily because moving the text lines to accommodate license plate format helps break it up, and license plates usually look a little goofy. On a more serious note, I believe that we need to protect clean water regulations, even if it means regulating industrial hog farms. NC Farm Families is an industrial hog farm propaganda organization opposed to clean water regulations that has had a long-standing feud with Waterkeeper Alliance over hog lagoon runoff standards. We cannot sacrifice clean water for the sake of profit. Finally, I want to touch on the issue of police brutality. It's disheartening to see innocent people being shot by police officers who don't have a warrant. We need to hold law enforcement accountable for their actions and demand justice for those who have been wronged. It doesn't matter what the victim had in their system; they still have the right to be treated with respect and dignity. In conclusion, there are many issues that we need to address in North Carolina and in the country as a whole. We need to demand better from our leaders and hold them accountable for their actions. We need to invest in our citizens and protect our environment. And most importantly, we need to treat each other with respect and dignity, regardless of our differences.
