Hey guys, have you ever been to Fredrico's in Cave Creek? It's legal, so how would it be any different than taking ibuprofen? I've been to so many Mexican food places, but Fredrico's is definitely in my top 3. Armando's used to be up there, but they've declined in quality in my opinion. Have you tried the Four Peaks oatmeal stout? It's pretty good, but I've never been to AZ Wilderness. Have any of you been to North Mountain?  Off topic, but which brewery do you think has the best food? I'm staying at a hotel near Mill Ave in Tempe, which is a long strip of bars and restaurants. I'm not sure if I should go to Scottsdale or Tempe for a night out. My work schedule is making it hard to find classes, but I need to take about 4-5 more before I can transfer.  Do any of you have experience with online classes? Is the interface nice? Do you think it's more difficult to learn online? Also, have any of you ever asked for extra crispy fries at a restaurant? It's a game changer.  I'm trying to transfer my CC college credits to get a bachelor's in business. Do you know if ASU is good about transferring credits? I didn't even know they had a business program online. Is there a cost for it?  I didn't know yard bins existed until recently. I might have to look into that. Also, has anyone been to any abandoned hospitals or anything? I want to go ghost hunting. The caverns sound fun too.  I'm thinking about camping as close as possible to Area 51. I know it's unlikely I'll see anything, but it's still fun. And speaking of drugs, has anyone tried bath salts or spice? I used to love them, but I've never had any bad experiences.  Anyway, has anyone been to Scout Cave? How long is the hike? And when people say "backpack," do they mean overnight? I want to camp somewhere scary, but I don't want to kill a bear.  Do the sites along the rim still have lakes? I really wanted to camp near a lake, but I thought I needed a reservation. Do you think I'll need one for Woods Canyon? And which do you prefer, Woods Canyon or Lynx Lake?  Also, has anyone been to The Vig? How's the food there? And what about Rehab Burger? I've only had the carne asada products at Popo's and Fajitas, but they were pretty good.  Lastly, have any of you tried the tortillas at Valle Luna? They're seriously the best I've ever had. And if you're ever at Wild Fish, try the steak. It's amazing.
