Hey there, can someone send me the link to the IRC? I'm currently watching the Notre Dame game and I have to say, as a huge ND fan, I think Ronnie Stanley would be a perfect pick for the Chargers. But let's talk about the draft in general. I haven't had the chance to watch many Packers games this year, so I'm curious to know what position they have Stanley playing. From what I've seen, he's a talented player who demands a double team, but some people don't think he's first-round talent. I disagree - I think a lot of offenses would love to have a guy like him on their team. Speaking of talented players, I have to give a shoutout to the person who called Tyler Lockett being good. That guy has some serious skills. But I also want to talk about Will Fuller. His speed isn't necessarily elite, but his combination of speed and route running allows him to consistently get open. Plus, his hands are elite - he reminds me of Antonio Brown. I could see Owa Odighizuwa playing the 3-4 end as well as being a perfect fit for Belichick's multiple fronts. And speaking of multiple fronts, I think Ronnie Stanley and Jaylon Smith will both go in the top 5. Two gold domers in the first 5 picks - how about that? I was surprised to see the Rams ranked as the 3rd best team and the Bucs as the 5th according to Vegas odds. But after watching some highlights, I have to say that Shaq Thompson looks like a beast. He may not be the best player to come out of this draft, but his enthusiasm on the field is unmatched. Now, let's talk about the Steelers. I hope they take a chance on Ben Roethlisberger. Sure, he's had some off-field issues, but he's been the heart and soul of the team since their last Super Bowl. If people took into account his production versus the talent around him throughout his career, they would consider him elite. I also think Shane Ray would be a great pick for the Steelers. He plays every down like it's his last, and that kind of play is contagious. But I don't think they should draft Landon Collins - they already have Shmarko Thomas and Will Allen, so strong safety isn't one of their top 5 needs. Speaking of needs, I think Xavier Cooper is the top DT in this class. Overall, I think I had a solid draft. Not many people could trade down into the 3rd after not having a pick yet, but I managed to pull it off. And while I may have made a mistake by not taking Trae Waynes, I still think Malcolm Brown would bolster the defense just as well. So there you have it - my thoughts on the draft and some of the top players. If you're looking for more in-depth analysis, I highly recommend following Matt Miller @nfldraftscout on Twitter.
