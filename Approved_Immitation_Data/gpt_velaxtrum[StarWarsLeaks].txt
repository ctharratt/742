The world is changing, and it's changing fast. We're living in an era where information is abundant, entertainment options are endless, and social media is riddled with burning towers. It's an era where people want to belong, to feel like they're part of something bigger than themselves. And that's why we're seeing the rise of unicorns - those nascent companies and entertainment products that exceed all previous sales and acceptance records. Take Adele's latest album, "25," for example. It's a star whose album got no negative reviews. And then there's "Star Wars," which grossed $238 million in a weekend. These are exponents of the modern era, and they're what people want to talk about, analyze, own, and feel involved with. They're the unicorns of the entertainment world, and they're only going to get bigger. But why is this happening? Why are people gravitating towards these unicorns? The answer is simple: people want to belong. In an era of chaos and cacophony, it's hard to feel like you're part of something cohesive. Social media is filled with disinformation and falsehoods, and it's easy to feel like you're just an observer, not a participant. But unicorns give people something to rally around. They give people a sense of community and belonging. They're something that people can talk about, analyze, and feel involved with. And in an era where people are desperate for connection, that's incredibly powerful. Of course, there are those who argue that unicorns are just a passing fad, that they're not sustainable in the long run. But I disagree. I think that unicorns are here to stay, and that they're only going to get bigger and more influential. Take Google, for example. It's a paragon of the tech world, and no one can compete with it. And then there's Amazon, which has completely revolutionized the way we shop. These are unicorns that have established a beachhead, and they're not going anywhere. And then there's Spotify. Sure, it's losing money, but it's also establishing a beachhead that even Apple can't overcome. People don't want choice - they want to go where their friends are. And Spotify is where their friends are. But what about the rest of the entertainment world? What about all the other albums and movies and TV shows that are out there? Well, the truth is that they're being plowed under. The big will get bigger, and everything else will be marginalized. It's not that these other products aren't good - it's just that they're not unicorns. They're not something that people can rally around and feel involved with. And in an era where people are desperate for connection, that's just not enough. So what does this mean for the future? Well, it means that we're going to see more unicorns. We're going to see more albums and movies and TV shows that exceed all previous sales and acceptance records. And we're going to see more people rallying around them, feeling like they're part of something bigger than themselves. But it also means that we're going to see a lot of other products being marginalized. We're going to see a lot of albums and movies and TV shows that just don't make the cut. And we're going to see a lot of people feeling left out, like they're not part of the cool crowd. And that's a problem. Because at the end of the day, we all want to belong. We all want to feel like we're part of something bigger than ourselves. And if we're not careful, we're going to end up with a society that's more divided than ever before. So what can we do about it? Well, for starters, we can start paying attention to the products that are being marginalized. We can start supporting the underdogs, the products that aren't unicorns but are still good. We can start talking about them, analyzing them, and feeling involved with them. And we can also start paying attention to the people around us. We can start reaching out to those who feel left out, who feel like they're not part of the cool crowd. We can start building connections and relationships, and we can start making people feel like they belong. Because at the end of the day, that's what it's all about. It's not about the unicorns or the big companies or the cool crowd. It's about people. It's about making people feel like they belong, like they're part of something bigger than themselves. So let's start paying attention. Let's start supporting the underdogs. Let's start building connections and relationships. And let's start making people feel like they belong. Because that's the only way we're going to build a society that's truly cohesive and connected.
