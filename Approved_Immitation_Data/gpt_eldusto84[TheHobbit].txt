The Hobbit trilogy has been a topic of much debate among fans of J.R.R. Tolkien's works. While some have praised Peter Jackson's adaptation of the beloved book, others have criticized it for being bloated and overly long. As a fan of both the book and the films, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create my own fan edit of the trilogy. My fan edit, titled J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, is a 4-hour long re-edit of the trilogy, split by an intermission. Like most other fan editors, I've cut the unnecessary subplots, characters, and general CGI nonsense that bogged the main story down. However, I've put an OCD-level of detail into this project to make it as good as possible. One of the biggest changes I made was to the pacing of the films. The original trilogy suffered from a slow pace, with many scenes feeling like they dragged on for too long. In my edit, I've tightened up the pacing, making the films feel more like a cohesive whole. I've also removed many of the unnecessary scenes that added nothing to the story, such as the EE Beorn scene. I didn't like the scene in my edit because the dwarves don't need to be re-introduced to the audience one by one like that. It just slowed the pace of the film down and didn't add anything to the story. My OCD is most displeased with this. Another change I made was to the Dol Guldur subplot. While I found it interesting, I felt that it distracted too much from the main story. The tone is much darker and just didn't quite fit. When Guillermo del Toro was working on the two-film idea, his second film was going to be a "bridge film" between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. I imagine that the Dol Guldur story would have played a large part of that concept. So my side quest film, Durin's Folk and the Hill of Sorcery, is sort of a nod to that abandoned idea. I also made changes to the characters themselves. For example, I removed the love triangle between Tauriel, Legolas, and Kili. It added nothing to the story and felt like a cheap attempt to appeal to a wider audience. I also removed the windlance subplot, as it felt unnecessary and didn't add anything to the story. One of the biggest challenges I faced was with the audio. I wanted to create a 5.1 digital surround sound experience, but I had issues working with the 7.1 audio from the original films. Plus, the extra two channels didn't really add all that much. In the end, I was able to create a great audio experience that really immerses the viewer in the world of Middle-earth. Another challenge was with the subtitles. I wanted to include them in my DVD/Blu-ray release, but I had to wait for them to be developed. I could have released a non-subtitles version, but then I'd have to re-upload the massive files all over again once they're finished! There shouldn't be a difference between the two. The file should be around 2.5GB or so! Despite these challenges, I'm really proud of the final product. I've put a lot of time and effort into this project, and I think it shows. The film looks and sounds great, and the pacing is much improved. I'm excited to share it with other fans of The Hobbit and see what they think. In conclusion, J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit is a fan edit that I created to improve upon the original trilogy. I've cut unnecessary scenes, tightened up the pacing, and made changes to the characters themselves. I'm really proud of the final product and can't wait to share it with other fans of the series.
