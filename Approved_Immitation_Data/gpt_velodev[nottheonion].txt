Ah, the Elf on the Shelf. A controversial holiday tradition that has parents either loving or hating it. As for me, I fall somewhere in the middle. Yes, I considered this before allowing it to proceed. This is, however, an adult concept. Kids do not understand privacy. Further, this is no different than the Santa myth itself "he sees you when you're sleeping". We were ok with that, right? The main thing this stupid thing seems to accomplish is to give your kids something to look forward to when they wake up, they can discover where the thing is. It's a curse for parents to move it around though. But let's talk about the value of the Santa mythology. A lot of people are confused about it. "Lies" and "commercialism" get bandied about. Legitimate concerns we should watch out for. The value of the Santa myth is more than just the fun, I think. At some early age, the Santa myth just doesn't stand up to any objective scrutiny. Only the most na√Øve continue to believe in it into young adulthood. Kids who realize this are more likely to turn a questioning eye upon their indoctrinated religion. Noah? Thumbs down. Be nice to each other? Sounds good. The Elf on the Shelf also has given us a chance to have a broader conversation with our children. This year our elf hand-made our children gifts (I made very rough drums for them in my workshop). We are able to explain to the elder kid that since we can afford presents, their little elf can save Santa's budget so he can spend it on kids who's parents can't afford anything, and this lets us talk about giving some of their presents away. Commercial? Yes. But it's just a doll, not an Xbox. Oddly enough, they can observe the Festivus tradition of an airing of grievances about the pole. It's a Festivus MIRACLE!!! I'm inclined to co-opt and expand the Festivus traditions to include a period of reflection on society's rules and expectations and an annual objective judgement on what to jettison or improve. Is there an "exhaust port" joke to be made here? But let's get back to the Elf on the Shelf. Wait, people are calling you a terrorist to your face on a regular basis? Where do you live? You don't have to live like a refugee. Serious question, does 4'33 contain... a bunch of encoded zeros? Was there a connected microphone producing a hiss? If so, does that hiss play back? If it's a null audio file, does this cause your speaker setup to hiss with a unique sound based on the amplification? Last line of the article: "Evan, has a learning disability and gets things confused easily." This is ridiculous, but I think for the wrong reasons, and probably for different reasons than you or what makes it noteworthy. Yoga in the West is about as far removed from its origins as American Chinese food (great documentary about General Tso on this topic). If you talk with an Indian person, they will ask "oh how do you like vomiting up the water?" Wait, what? So rich white ladies teaching each other how to look extra sexy at the coffee store is a bit far removed from what is literally a religion, and it's probably worthwhile to make note of that now and again. But this is where I differ from the idea that we've "got to shut down any imperialist appropriation". If there's one redeeming quality of Western imperialism, it's the cultural memory and expansiveness and growth that comes from learning from other people (if we could do that without any genocide or assholery then even better). Yoga is excellent exercise, good meditation, and no doubt has health benefits, and that alone makes it worthwhile. If they were concerned about honoring the origins, they could learn a little about what people believe and their history in the class. There's no theft of what is the most utilitarian parts of humanity - moving your body - there is only shared experience and better understanding. Oh, you didn't read to paragraph three of OP's link: "The pigeons were just as good at spotting small calcium deposits associated with cancer, which appear as white specks on mammograms" Hilarious typo, "Black Whole" sounds like the album by Spinal Tap. "The answer is none, none more black". After reading the article I can't believe the two psychics have been charged with a crime. This dude was entirely at fault and in control of his faculties. Is this for real? Is this fact checked? It seems impossible. I read the article and the headline appears to reflect the situation very clearly. Is this article a fabrication? Just based on my armchair scientist understanding of the book "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks" I am almost certain that using the same slab of foreskin from 15 years ago (willfully donated? By the parent or the dick owner?) is not possible. Foreskin is not an immortal cell line. Partially true, they have to tear the skin away from the glans prior to cutting. There is a loose connection there. You haven't seen the bumper sticker? OMG TRUMP: Real hope, Real Change. At first when I was reading it I thought it was written on someone's phone. But the capitals and ampersand usage is not consistent with that. My theory is that this is someone with a pretty serious mental illness. They have racing thoughts and when in a manic phase their writing looks like this. The fact that they are directly addressing a public figure also lends some weight to this argument. Yes! I am FASCINATED by this. At a minimum, even if you add in periods where they have non-proper noun capitalization (and drop the extras), the way these thoughts are formed is just so bizarre. "...to back your firings this campaign", means what? It's like they think his only skill is in firing people, but how is that a useful thing, other than as an extreme edge case? Clearly, a man of God... How could someone not realize how breathless (and therefore hopelessly naive/stupid) they sound with that capitalized "AND Donald Trump" in there joining completely unrelated ideas? The only other time I've seen writing like this is when receiving emails from a manic friend (or their parent). I'd love to see this kind of thing show up in professional writing as character development, but that just seems impossible. Additionally, I think it's interesting to consider how many people are labeled "religious" as a cover for an otherwise debilitating mental illness, and if bottling up racing and paranoid thoughts in repetitive prayer creates a backstop for them. Can this be fixed? "Donald Trump is a formidable candidate for the presidency. We need him in this race. Trump needs a team of prayer warriors to cover and support you through this battle. The Bible is filled with stories of leaders who rely on prayer for support. A King is not a one-man army and needs spiritual support. Find ... ". Nope. I give up. Craziest shit I've ever read. In conclusion, the Elf on the Shelf may be a controversial holiday tradition, but it does have its benefits. It allows for broader conversations with children and can even teach them about giving to those less fortunate. As for the other topics discussed, they range from the bizarre to the downright concerning. But one thing is for sure, they all make for interesting discussions.
