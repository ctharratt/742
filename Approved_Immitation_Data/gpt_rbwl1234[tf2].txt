Holy shit, I can't believe this is still an issue. It's been years since the game was released and yet here we are, still dealing with the same problems. I mean, come on, how hard is it to rotate the maps properly? I paid for this game, I paid to support the developers and their content, but what am I getting in return? One map out of the entire rotation. And don't even get me started on the pass. Sure, you don't need the pass to play the maps, but the pass requires you to play on the maps. And guess what? I can't play on them. So what's the point of even having the pass? It's like paying for a gym membership but only being allowed to use one machine. It's ridiculous. And yet, there are still people out there who are perfectly content with the free content they're getting. Eight years after release and they're still satisfied with the same old maps. It's like they have no standards or expectations whatsoever. Did they even read what I said? I paid for this game, I paid to support the developers and their content. I didn't pay for a half-assed product that doesn't even meet my basic expectations. It's like funding a project on Kickstarter. You give money to something you believe in, in order to support the developer and get whatever perks they provide. In this case, not only am I not getting the perks, I'm not even getting the base product. And yet, people still defend the developers and their lack of effort. It's like they're blind to the fact that we're being ripped off. And don't even get me started on the DM. He's like a god, but not a benevolent one. He doesn't care if your bird is named Anne Frank, if you roll a one, it will die in the most awful way imaginable. It's like he takes pleasure in our suffering. "You and your party approach a goblin hut with a fireplace and a well, you can hear mystical chanting from the hut. What do you do?" "I cast detect Gibus." And what do we get? A Gibus. Big whoop. But then again, maybe that's just the nature of RP games. It's like a never-ending cycle of chaos and pandemonium. The heavy starts glowing red, the scout fails his lag check, and then he gets stabbed in the face and dies. And how many sessions have we been through? It's like we're all in this together, for better or for worse. And speaking of heavy, whenever I play medic, I always make sure to hug the heavy. He's like a big, immobile teddy bear. He's not going to rocket jump away behind enemy lines like a soldier or demo. And yet, there's always that one guy who thinks he's invincible and charges headfirst into battle. But let's talk about weapons for a second. I got the medal beak one for medic, combined it with the armor and gas mask, and it looks pretty good. They work well with themes, just not on their own. And what about the strange holy mackerel? I named it Paul, set the description to "baited and outsmarted," and made a set devoted to fish kills. It gets referenced by my community server from time to time. "At least you aren't Paul." "Fucking Paul." It's nice to have a little bit of humor in the midst of all this chaos. But then there are the weapons that are just plain annoying. Like the minis. They're just a bitch. I can normally deal with crutch and loaders, but having a minishitty means that if I want to do anything, I have to take into account the fact that he just rebuilt it. And don't even get me started on the spy with a flamethrower. It's like, "Oh fuck, the spy has a flameth...oh wait, it's just a medic." And then there's the issue of balance. How do you balance a weapon like the powerjack? It's not necessarily overpowered, but it's definitely more forgiving than the standard flamethrower. If you mess up, you can rapidly switch back to the aeroblast. And yet, when you're playing against a sniper, it's because he can hit you. Against the standard degreaser pyro, it's watching him miss you with his shotgun, charge you with the power jack, see you charging while he's pulling out his power jack, switch to shotgun, realize he goofed, switch to flamethrower, aeroblast you, then switch to shotgun to finish you off. It's like the equivalent of wm1 for people who know how to use it. An unmobile short ranged person should be unviable, but he's not because once he gets you into the air, it's a shotgun to the face and a power jack to the dick. And then there are the nerfs. How do you nerf a weapon without making it completely useless? Take the danger shield, for example. It's supposed to act as a crutch for snipers, but maybe it should help with learning, like being unable to one-shot body shot at full charge. And what about the sonic wave? They reduced Sona's q range when it was updated, and it was present for months until they "reverted the accidental nerf." Then a few months later, they complained that the range was too long and reduced her movement speed and lowered the damage and scaling. It's like they're constantly switching minds every turn so Pegasus can't read their mind. But at the end of the day, we keep playing. We keep coming back for more, even though we know we're being ripped off. Maybe it's because we're masochists, or maybe it's because we just love the chaos and pandemonium. Either way, we keep playing, and we keep hoping that one day, the developers will finally listen to us and give us what we paid for.
