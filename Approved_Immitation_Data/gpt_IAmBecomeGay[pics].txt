What all you fucking nerds are arguing is moot. Welcome to reddit. I'm not here to argue about anything, but I do have something to say about the topic of anxiety and fear. It's something that affects a lot of people, myself included, and it's not something that should be taken lightly. Anxiety and fear can be debilitating. They can prevent you from doing things that you want to do, or even things that you need to do. They can make you feel like you're trapped, like you're suffocating, like you're going to die. And the worst part is that they can be triggered by the most innocuous things, things that other people don't even notice. For me, it's being in the middle of a crowd. It doesn't matter if it's a concert, a movie theater, or just a busy street. If I'm surrounded by people and I can't move, I start to panic. My heart races, my palms sweat, my breathing becomes shallow. I feel like I'm going to pass out or throw up. It's not a pleasant experience. I've tried to overcome this fear. I've tried deep breathing exercises, visualization techniques, and even medication. But nothing seems to work. I still get anxious in crowds, and I still avoid them whenever possible. I know that I'm not alone in this. There are millions of people who suffer from anxiety and fear, and it's not something that can be easily cured. It takes time, patience, and a lot of hard work to overcome these feelings. So, to all the people out there who are struggling with anxiety and fear, I want you to know that you're not alone. There are people who understand what you're going through, and there are resources available to help you. Don't be afraid to reach out for help, whether it's from a therapist, a support group, or just a friend who understands. And to all the people who don't understand anxiety and fear, I ask that you be patient and compassionate. It's not something that can be easily explained or understood, but it's very real and very painful for those who experience it. In conclusion, let's stop arguing about trivial things and start focusing on what really matters: our mental health and well-being. Let's support each other, listen to each other, and work together to overcome our fears and anxieties. Because at the end of the day, that's what really matters.
