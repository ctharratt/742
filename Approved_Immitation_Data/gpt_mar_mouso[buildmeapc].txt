Hey there! It's great to see that you're interested in building your own PC. It can be a bit overwhelming at first, but with some research and guidance, you'll be able to create a machine that suits your needs and budget. First off, I noticed that you were considering Silverstone cases. They make some great options for small builds, so definitely take a look at their offerings. However, keep in mind that the case you choose will affect the size and compatibility of your other components, so make sure to double-check the specs before making a purchase. Another thing to consider is your storage options. You mentioned wanting to have a budget build, so I would recommend going with an SSD only or a maximum of one HDD. SSDs are more expensive, but they offer faster boot and load times, which can greatly improve your overall experience. If you do decide to go with an HDD, make sure to choose one with a high RPM (at least 7200) for better performance. When it comes to gaming, it's important to keep in mind that not all games are well-optimized. DayZ, for example, is notorious for running poorly on even high-end machines. So, don't be too discouraged if you run into performance issues with certain games. That being said, it's always a good idea to do some research on the recommended specs for the games you plan on playing. In terms of monitors, it's really a matter of personal preference. Some people prefer the larger screen size of a TV, while others prefer the higher pixel density and performance of a monitor. Keep in mind that monitors are built for performance, while TVs are built for casual viewing. If you do decide to go with a TV, make sure to choose one with a low response time to avoid ghosting and other issues. When it comes to building your PC, it's important to keep your budget in mind. You don't need to replace every part of your current setup, so try to re-use as much as possible to save money. Make sure to choose a power supply with at least 600W and a Bronze rating for efficiency. And, if you're on a tight budget, consider dropping down to a lower-end graphics card like the R9 270. If you're interested in overclocking, make sure to choose a CPU and motherboard that support it. And, when it comes to GPU brand, it really comes down to personal preference. AMD and Nvidia both offer great options, so do some research and choose the one that suits your needs and budget. One thing to keep in mind is that bottlenecking can be an issue with certain components. For example, pairing a high-end GPU with a low-end CPU can result in poor performance. Make sure to choose components that are compatible and won't bottleneck each other. If you're not sure where to start, consider posting your build on forums like /r/buildapc or /r/techsupport for feedback and advice. And, don't be afraid to ask questions - there are no dumb questions when it comes to building a PC. Overall, building your own PC can be a fun and rewarding experience. Just make sure to do your research, choose components that are compatible and suit your needs, and keep your budget in mind. Good luck, and have fun!
