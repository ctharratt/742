It's no secret that the media has a certain bias when it comes to politics. The so-called "liberal media" has been accused of using subliminal messaging tricks on conservative candidates, while the conservative media has been accused of doing the same to liberal candidates. But what about the Bush family? They have been in the political spotlight for decades, and their story is one of both triumph and tragedy. Jeb Bush was supposed to be the second Bush president, not his brother George. Jeb was the clean-cut, politically savvy intellectual of the family who was supposed to carry on his father's legacy. But George had other plans. Despite being considered a joke (a drunk and druggie up until about age 40), George ran for president and actually won. This was a blow to Jeb, who had been planning to run for governor of Florida. George stole the spotlight by running for governor of Texas as soon as he heard Jeb was planning on running. George ended up winning governorship of Texas, and Jeb lost the race in Florida. George actually wrote in his book that he was pretty upset that his parents (George H. W. and Barbara) were more sad that Jeb lost his race, than happy that George won his. Jeb eventually won the governorship of Florida, but he couldn't win the presidency without his then-president brother's help. So finally, Jeb wins Florida, does his term, and now runs for president after patiently waiting for Obama to leave office. And what happens? A jokester like Trump comes along and destroys Jeb's chances. Poor luck, that guy. But Jeb isn't the only member of the Bush family to suffer from bad luck. George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States, has been watching the current election season with amazement. He rises before dawn and reads political news online. He fires off emails to his old advisers to check on the latest campaign-trail gossip. He tunes into the debates, even though they stretch past his bedtime. In private and among friends, Bush and his wife, Laura, express amazement at an election season that has been hijacked by Donald Trump. Bush has been troubled by a Republican electorate that - so far, at least - prioritizes Trump's anger and projected strength over Jeb's qualifications and experience, friends and former advisers said. "He knows that all the qualities it takes to be a good president are not necessarily all the qualities it takes to be elected president," said Donald L. Evans, a confidant and former secretary of commerce. "Entertainment and showtime is one thing, but being the leader of the free world, being the leader of this country in these troubled, difficult times, is something totally different." On Monday - Presidents' Day - Bush tried to help Jeb do just that. After deliberately avoiding politics throughout his post-presidency, Bush stepped back into the arena for an evening rally in North Charleston with his brother, the former Florida governor. Bush's appearance was an urgent mission to energize Jeb's struggling candidacy ahead of next Saturday's primary. But it also firmly put the stamp of the last Republican to occupy the White House on the GOP contest at a moment of deep division. The GOP is being torn apart by a battle between the business establishment, movement conservatives, and pitchfork populists. Bush's appearance was a reminder that electing Jeb would continue a dynasty. Some activists on the right believe George W. Bush was insufficiently conservative as president, citing the 2008 bank bailouts and his advocacy for a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. But Bush's appearance was also a reminder of a time when the Republican party was more united. Bush is popular among Republicans in South Carolina, especially members of the military services. The former president's approval rating among South Carolina Republicans stands at 84 percent, according to a private poll commissioned two months ago by Katon Dawson, a former state GOP chairman. That would put him in a tie with Gov. Nikki Haley and Sen. Tim Scott as the most popular Republicans in the state. "The question is, is that popularity transferable?" Dawson said. "I don't think it's transferable if he just says, 'Jeb's a good guy and trust him.' I think it is transferable if George W. Bush comes here, takes the gloves off and starts getting at it against Trump." But Bush is unlikely to attack any candidate. "Having been in the Oval Office, you can expect him to be a statesman and focus on extolling the virtues of his brother and sharing observations about what he thinks the requirements are for the next president," said Karl Rove, Bush's longtime chief strategist. Anita McBride, a longtime Bush family aide, said George W. Bush "is dying to get out there," adding: "He doesn't want to hurt his brother; he wants to help his brother." If past is prologue, Trump will use Bush's appearance as ammunition to torment Jeb. Last week in New Hampshire, Trump mocked Jeb for campaigning with his 90-year-old mother, Barbara Bush, the former first lady. Rove argued such a swipe would backfire. "If any candidate decides they're going to score points by going after 43, it's going to be a problem for them - a mistake in judgment," he said. The Bush family has had its share of ups and downs in politics. Jeb was supposed to be the second Bush president, but George stole the spotlight and won the presidency instead. Now, Jeb is struggling to win the Republican nomination, and George is watching from the sidelines. But the Bush family is still a force to be reckoned with in politics, and their appearance on the campaign trail is a reminder of a time when the Republican party was more united. Whether or not Jeb can win the nomination remains to be seen, but the Bush family will always be a part of American political history.
