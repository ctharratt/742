I recently made the decision to close out my TD All-Inclusive account and I have no regrets so far. However, I still need to call and downgrade my VISA. In my search for a new bank, I ended up going with PC Financial over Tangerine because they use CIBC ATMs, which are more common near me than ScotiaBank. That being said, Tangerine has been great to me for many years and still holds all of my savings and investments. When it comes to credit cards, I recently received my Canadian Tire Options MasterCard. While the everyday rewards rate isn't very good, they run 30x points days reasonably often, which makes the reward rate 12%. If you use it as a backup and take advantage of those 30x points days, it works out as a good card. However, as a disclaimer, I work for CT and still wouldn't recommend the card for everyday use. In terms of RRSP contributions, it's important to note that contribution room builds over time. At $45k, you're still in a relatively low tax bracket, so you'll maximize your savings if you wait until you're in a higher tax bracket to put money into your RRSP. Assuming, of course, that you expect your income to build over time and then drop off again once you retire. If you expect your retirement income to be higher than your current income, you would be better off using your RRSP room now. When it comes to credit card numbers, it's important to note that the number on the back of the card is for more than just lost or stolen cards. Why would they put a number that was only for lost or stolen cards on the back of the card? That doesn't help anyone. I understand the hate for TD, as I'm in the midst of switching all of my products away from them because of their shady practices. However, the TD First Class Infinite VISA is probably the best travel card for your situation. It's 4.5% back if you book your flights through their (Expedia) portal. I switched to the BMO World Elite MasterCard, which, in my opinion, is the best alternative to the TD card. Plus, I can use it at CostCo, which is a huge plus. When it comes to choosing a credit card, it's important to do your homework and choose one that suits your needs. For example, if you own a complex car that cannot be easily repaired by every shop, you should choose a card that offers nearest service. While I happen to think 'nearest service' is a bad deal too, it's not like they make it a secret. It's important to choose a card that fits your lifestyle and needs. When it comes to choosing a career path, it's important to consider the long-term financial benefits. While $35k may seem like a lot of money, it's peanuts compared to the jobs available with a university degree. Engineering jobs, for example, pay significantly better. Unless the job you're considering has an extremely steep pay scale and you expect to be able to increase your earnings there considerably after a few years, pursuing the engineering degree will almost certainly be better in the long run. If you're looking for a new bank, PC Financial is a great option. They offer chequing, savings, and credit cards, and use the CIBC infrastructure for ATMs. I chose them over Tangerine for chequing because CIBC ATMs are more common than ScotiaBank ones near me. However, I still use Tangerine for my savings and investments. When it comes to being paid for your work, your employer is required to pay you for any work you do between now and when your employment ends. If you leave your job and they don't pay you for the work you've done in that pay period, then you'd have to fight them through the labour board. But assuming you have proper documentation, it would be an open and shut case. So the answer to #4 is yes, definitely keep proof of all work done, and involve the labour board if needed. If you have a TD card, you can claim any travel-related expense on it as well. It's done through their web portal and takes a few days, but it's pretty painless. I just submitted and was reimbursed $400 this way. While the TD card has better rewards since it's 4.5% when booked through them, the BMO card has better rewards overall. The four airport lounge passes are a ~$100+ dollar value, for example. It does carry a higher annual fee though. But both TD and BMO will waive the fee with their top-tier chequing account. When it comes to being a landlord, it's important to consider whether it's something you want to do as a hobby or for financial gain. If you want to be a landlord as a hobby, with the added bonus of making some income from it, then you should do it. Not a lot of hobbies end up making you money. But if you don't really want to be a landlord and your only concern is the financials, then you will likely be better off selling the house and investing the cash elsewhere. When it comes to vacation pay, it's important to note that when you add it to your regular cheque, payroll software extrapolates the total amount of the cheque to be your annual income and applies the relevant tax rate. You'll get the excess back when you file your taxes, but you're out that money in the meantime. Look at your most recent pay stub - your accrued vacation will be listed on it. You are entitled to all of your accrued vacation when you quit or are terminated. In conclusion, it's important to do your research and choose a bank, credit card, and career path that fits your lifestyle and needs. Don't be afraid to switch banks or credit cards if you're not happy with the service or rewards. And when it comes to your career, consider the long-term financial benefits and choose a path that will benefit you in the long run.
