A recent poll conducted by "Naral Pro-Choice America" has been making the rounds on social media, but I have my doubts about its reliability. Instead, I would like to turn to the Pew poll, which I believe is a more accurate representation of public opinion on abortion. According to the Pew poll, 55% of the US population believes in abortion in only a few or no circumstances. This is not an extremist view, but rather a moderate one that reflects the complexity of the issue. Moving on to taxes, there has been a lot of debate about the proposed tax plan and its impact on the wealthy. Some have argued that millionaires will end up paying less in taxes, but this is not necessarily true. In fact, a person making a hundred thousand a year would only pay 7.25% in taxes total, which is less than what they would pay now. It's important to take into account deductions and tax breaks when analyzing the impact of the tax plan. Overall, millionaires are paying about as much taxes today as they did under Eisenhower, but this is largely due to the effects of tax breaks rather than marginal rates. Turning to the Iraq war, there has been a lot of controversy surrounding the intelligence that led to the invasion. While it is true that very few opponents of the war publicly expressed doubt about whether Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, this does not necessarily mean that the intelligence was accurate. As we now know, the statements about WMDs turned out to be false, and it is possible that faulty information played a role in shaping public opinion at the time. Moving on to the issue of poverty, there has been a lot of debate about the effectiveness of welfare programs. While some argue that these programs have been successful in reducing poverty, others point to evidence that suggests otherwise. For example, a more accurate poverty measure that takes into account the cost of utilities, housing, healthcare, food, and clothing shows that poverty has not decreased significantly over time despite increased spending on welfare programs. Additionally, research has shown that higher regulatory burdens have a negative impact on the economy, and that countries and industries with lighter regulatory burdens tend to experience higher GDP per capita and productivity growth rates. Finally, I would like to address the issue of political bias on social media. It is no secret that certain platforms tend to have a certain political bent, and this can make it difficult for individuals with differing viewpoints to engage in meaningful dialogue. However, it is important to remember that downvoting opinions that one disagrees with is not an effective way to foster productive conversation. Instead, we should strive to engage with those who hold different views in a respectful and open-minded manner. In conclusion, there are many complex issues facing our society today, and it is important to approach them with a critical and nuanced perspective. By relying on reliable sources of information and engaging in respectful dialogue with those who hold different views, we can work towards a more informed and inclusive society.
