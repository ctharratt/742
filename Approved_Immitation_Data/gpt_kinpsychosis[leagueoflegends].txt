League of Legends: The Evolution of the Game League of Legends, or LoL for short, has been around for over a decade now. It has gone through numerous changes, updates, and patches, but it still remains one of the most popular games in the world. Some players have been around since the beginning, while others have just started playing. Regardless of when you started playing, one thing is for sure: LoL is not dying, it is evolving. One of the biggest changes in LoL is the departure of some of the game's most iconic players. Players like Doublelift, Sneaky, and Meteos have all retired from professional play. While it may seem like the end of an era, it is actually a sign that LoL is growing. New players are stepping up to take their place, and the game is becoming more competitive than ever before. One player who has always been a bit controversial is Nightblue3, or NB3 for short. He has always had a lot of hate directed towards him, but he has also had a lot of fans. Regardless of how you feel about him, one thing is for sure: he is a great teacher. He is always very detailed in explaining what he should have done, what worked and what didn't, why he messed up, and what his teammates did well or could have done better. He is very verbal, and that is something that a lot of players appreciate. Another change that has been made to the game is the addition of new champions. Some players have complained that there are too many champions in the game, while others have suggested that there should be even more. One thing that is clear is that Riot Games, the company behind LoL, is always looking for ways to keep the game fresh and exciting. One recent change that has been made to the game is the buff to minions. While some players have complained that it is pointless, others have pointed out that it adds more diversity to the game. It also makes it more challenging for players who rely on their minions to do most of the work. One thing that has not changed in LoL is the toxicity of some players. There are always going to be players who are rude, disrespectful, and downright mean. However, there are also players who are kind, helpful, and supportive. It is up to each player to decide which type of player they want to be. One thing that players should appreciate more is the hard work that Riot Games puts into the game. While there are bugs that have gone unchanged for ages, the amount of content that they keep pumping out is impressive. They are always adding new champions, skins, and game modes. They are always looking for ways to improve the game and make it more enjoyable for players. One thing that players should also appreciate is the risk that professional players take when they decide to go pro. They are not only risking everything from the perspective of education and a future job, but they are also doing it for a very short period of time. They need to earn as much money as possible so that when they do decide to retire, they don't need to worry about what they are going to eat tomorrow. For new players, there are a few things that they should keep in mind. First, they should always try to last hit the minions. This is how they will earn gold, which is essential for buying items. Second, they should always try to win trades with the enemy champion. This means dealing more damage to them than they deal to you. Finally, they should always try to go for objectives, such as towers, dragons, and inhibitors. Champion kills are not as important as objectives. In conclusion, LoL is not dying, it is evolving. The game has gone through numerous changes over the years, but it still remains one of the most popular games in the world. New players are stepping up to take the place of the old guard, and the game is becoming more competitive than ever before. While there are still some toxic players, there are also players who are kind, helpful, and supportive. Players should appreciate the hard work that Riot Games puts into the game, and they should also appreciate the risk that professional players take when they decide to go pro. Finally, new players should remember to always try to last hit the minions, win trades with the enemy champion, and go for objectives.
