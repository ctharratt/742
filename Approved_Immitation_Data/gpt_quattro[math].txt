Okay, so let's talk about the concept of linear time in relation to proofs. Linear time, as we all know, refers to the amount of time it takes to complete a task in a straight line, without any deviations or interruptions. In the context of proofs, linear time refers to the amount of time it takes to complete a proof from start to finish, without any interruptions or distractions. However, it's important to note that linear time with respect to proofs does not necessarily mean linear time with respect to the original problem. In fact, there is an entire time hierarchy that shows providing a certain amount of additional time allows for additional problems to be solved. Separate hierarchies exist for both deterministic and non-deterministic Turing machines. The implication of this is that a class such as NP (verify in polynomial time) is a strict subset of NEXPTIME (verify in exponential time). This means that not all math proofs can be verified in polynomial time. This is a really important concept to understand, especially for those of us who are interested in pursuing a career in mathematics or computer science. Now, I know that some people find this course really theoretical and boring. But hate to break it to you, if that is the case, you're not going to find anything exciting out there. Theoretical concepts are the foundation of all scientific and mathematical research. Without a solid understanding of theory, we cannot hope to make any meaningful progress in our respective fields. I understand that some people may find this course difficult, but that's okay. I remember when I was studying Probabilistic Combinatorics, it was by far the hardest course I took. After that, Extremal Combinatorics was definitely the next hardest. But those courses forced me to really understand combinatorial reasoning, which has been incredibly useful in my research. The math department knew how to kick our asses pretty well, but it was all worth it in the end. Topology, in particular, made me feel some type of way. It's a really fascinating subject, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in pursuing a career in mathematics. Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room. I'm referring, of course, to the recent controversy surrounding a certain lecturer who was let go from their position due to their inability to understand that they don't run the show. This person exemplifies the very definition of hubris. They didn't get their way, so they threw a huge tantrum in public. They just come off as incredibly childish and immature. In the grown-up world, you realize that you really need to earn your place before trying to upend established policies. This person must be the poster child for /r/iamverysmart. They contribute little unless they get over their insecurities. Moving on, let's talk about the benefits of using algebraic circuits instead of traditional notation. One benefit is that it can simplify formulas easier in circuit-notation than in the usual notation. This can be incredibly useful in certain contexts, such as when dealing with large amounts of data. Another benefit is that it can provide better insight into the limits of what certain circuits can express in terms of computability. Arbitrary circuits are incredibly powerful, but algebraic circuits may be able to show that certain limited classes of circuits cannot represent various formulae. However, it's important to note that not everyone may find this framework intuitive. Some people may prefer traditional notation, and that's okay. The end-game here is not to force everyone to use algebraic circuits, but rather to provide an alternative framework for those who may find it useful. Now, let's talk about machine learning. Machine learning is really just a fancy way of saying computational statistics. So, what you're asking is "can I use statistics to help math". The answer to that is yes, but it's important to note that most mathematicians like proved theorems and not just probably correct theorems. Automated theorem provers use formal logic and fall within the realm of traditional AI, and not really machine learning. However, if you're interested in pursuing a career in machine learning, you really only need a strong understanding of calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and a tiny bit of convex optimization. Real/complex analysis aren't really necessary, unless you want to fully grasp stuff like Gaussian processes. In conclusion, there are a lot of interesting concepts to explore in mathematics and computer science. Linear time with respect to proofs is just one of them. It's important to have a solid understanding of theory in order to make meaningful progress in our respective fields. And, of course, it's important to always remain humble and open-minded, even in the face of controversy or disagreement.
