When it comes to roleplaying games, there are a lot of options out there. But for those who want to delve into the world of science fiction and space exploration, there are two systems that stand out: GURPS and Heroquest. GURPS, or Generic Universal RolePlaying System, has been around since the 1980s and has a dedicated line of source material specifically for science fiction and space exploration games. This means that players have access to a wealth of information and resources to help them create their own unique worlds and characters. One of the things that sets GURPS apart from other systems is its emphasis on realism. In GURPS, one bullet can definitely kill someone, which adds a level of danger and tension to combat that other systems may not have. This realism extends to other aspects of the game as well, such as the physics of space travel and the limitations of technology. But while GURPS may be realistic, it can also be complex and overwhelming for new players. The system uses a point-buy system for character creation, which means that players have to allocate points to different attributes and skills. This can be daunting for those who are new to the game or who prefer a more streamlined approach. Enter Heroquest, a newer system that offers a more flexible and intuitive approach to character creation. In Heroquest, anything can be an ability, and each ability has a rank that determines its impact on the story. This means that players have more freedom to define their characters exactly how they want, without being limited by a set list of skills and attributes. Heroquest also rewards player creativity and innovation. Anything that can be used to solve problems can be an ability, which means that players can come up with unique solutions to challenges that may not have been anticipated by the game master. This encourages players to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions to problems, which can lead to some truly memorable moments in the game. One of the areas where Heroquest may fall short, however, is in its lack of specific rules for certain aspects of science fiction and space exploration games. For example, there are no specific rules for starship construction in the Heroquest 2e Core Rules. However, this can be easily remedied by statting the starship as a character or as the abilities of a character, using keywords to represent different aspects of the ship. Ultimately, the choice between GURPS and Heroquest comes down to personal preference. GURPS offers a more realistic and detailed approach to science fiction and space exploration games, while Heroquest offers more flexibility and encourages player creativity. Both systems have their strengths and weaknesses, and it's up to the players to decide which one is right for them. One thing that both systems have in common, however, is the importance of storytelling. In science fiction and space exploration games, the story is often just as important as the mechanics of the game. Players want to feel like they are part of an epic adventure, exploring strange new worlds and encountering alien races. The system they choose should support and enhance that storytelling experience, rather than getting in the way of it. In conclusion, whether you choose GURPS or Heroquest for your science fiction and space exploration games, the most important thing is to have fun and tell a great story. Both systems offer unique and exciting ways to explore the universe, and with a little creativity and imagination, the possibilities are endless. So grab your dice and get ready to boldly go where no one has gone before!
