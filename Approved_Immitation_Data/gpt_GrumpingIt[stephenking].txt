I have to say, I am beyond excited for Stephen King's upcoming novel, End of Watch. I caught wind of it when I watched a video discussing the book and excitedly pointed it out to my friend. Unfortunately, he didn't share my enthusiasm, but that's okay because I am more than happy to gush about it to anyone who will listen. The dust jacket flap alone has me hooked. The idea of something evil awakening in a traumatic brain injury clinic is already giving me chills. And the fact that it's Brady Hartsfield, the perpetrator of the Mercedes Massacre, who has been in a vegetative state for five years, just adds to the suspense. The doctors say that a complete recovery is unlikely, but behind the drool and stare, Brady is awake and in possession of deadly new powers. I can't even imagine the havoc he could wreak without ever leaving his hospital room. But what really has me excited is the fact that retired police detective Bill Hodges, the unlikely hero of Mr. Mercedes and Finders Keepers, is back. Along with his partner, Holly Gibney, who delivered the blow to Hartsfield's head that put him on the brain injury ward. When they are called to a murder-suicide with ties to the Mercedes Massacre, they find themselves pulled into their most dangerous case yet. And it's not just their lives at risk, but those of Hodges's friend Jerome Robinson and his teenage sister, Barbara. Brady Hartsfield is back and planning revenge not just on Bill Hodges and his friends, but on an entire city. The fact that Stephen King is bringing the Hodges trilogy to a sublimely terrifying conclusion is just icing on the cake. I have always been a fan of King's detective fiction, but when you add in the supernatural suspense that he is known for, it's a recipe for an up-all-night read. I can't wait to see how it all ends. But as excited as I am for End of Watch, I have to take a moment to appreciate some of Stephen King's other works. I mean, the man is a master of horror and suspense. And his book covers are just as iconic as his stories. One of my personal favorites is the cover of The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger. Roland looks exactly how I pictured him in my mind, and the cover just oozes with the forces of good and evil that stand off in the books. It's a perfect representation of the story within. Another cover that I love is the one for Salem's Lot. I can't even explain why, but I have always been drawn to it. I want a first edition copy of it just because of how great the cover is. And let's not forget about the matching paperback set of The Dark Tower series from the UK. It looks absolutely wonderful, and I have it saved in my cart on Amazon for when I finally have room for it on my bookshelf. I mean, these books are so important to me, and I have multiple copies of each book, but none of them match. They deserve a matching set, don't you think? But back to End of Watch. I am just so excited to see how it all ends. I have been a fan of Bill Hodges since Mr. Mercedes, and I can't wait to see how he and his friends take on Brady Hartsfield once again. And the fact that it's the conclusion to the Hodges trilogy just adds to the anticipation. I have to admit, though, that I am a little nervous. I mean, Stephen King has a way of getting under your skin and making you question everything. And the fact that Brady Hartsfield is back and planning revenge on an entire city is just terrifying. But that's what makes King's writing so great. He knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat and make you want more. I just hope that End of Watch lives up to my expectations. I have been waiting for this book for what feels like forever, and I don't want to be disappointed. But with Stephen King at the helm, I have a feeling that it's going to be one hell of a ride. In conclusion, I am beyond excited for End of Watch. The dust jacket flap alone has me hooked, and the fact that it's the conclusion to the Hodges trilogy just adds to the anticipation. Stephen King is a master of horror and suspense, and his book covers are just as iconic as his stories. I can't wait to see how it all ends, but I am also a little nervous. King has a way of getting under your skin and making you question everything. But that's what makes his writing so great. He knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat and make you want more.
