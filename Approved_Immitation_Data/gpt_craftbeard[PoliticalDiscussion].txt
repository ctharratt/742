Well, well, well, here we are again, folks. Another election year, another round of political drama and intrigue. It's like a never-ending soap opera, except instead of love triangles and secret affairs, we have debates and attack ads. And let me tell you, this year's election is shaping up to be a doozy. First of all, can we talk about the electoral map? I mean, have you seen this thing? It's like a giant game of Risk, except instead of armies, we have states. And right now, it's looking like the Democrats have a pretty solid advantage. But here's the thing: they're still six electoral votes short of a win. Six! That's like being one question away from winning a game show and then getting it wrong. It's so close, yet so far. Now, I know what you're thinking: "But, there's no way the Republicans can flip those six states. It's just not possible." And you know what? You're probably right. I mean, when you look at past elections, several of those states haven't gone red since Reagan. It defies all logic, really. But that won't stop the media from portraying it as a "dead heat" up until the bitter end, just like they did in 2012. And we all know how that turned out. Speaking of past elections, can we talk about New Hampshire for a second? What the hell happened there in 2000? I mean, if it weren't for that one point swing, Gore would have won the election. And yet, everyone blames Florida. It's like the whole country has collective amnesia or something. But I digress. Let's talk about Texas for a minute. Now, I know I'm biased because I live here, but hear me out. Texas has not always been a strictly conservative state. We had Ann Richards as governor for many years prior to George W. Bush. And our major cities are some of the largest in the country, and they're all becoming increasingly liberal. Sure, the rural areas will always be super conservative, but that's true of most places. And with the ever-increasing Hispanic population, Texas is going to become a huge battleground in the future. Mark my words. But let's get back to the presidential race. Can we all just agree that this is the most hated pair of nominees in recent memory? I mean, Hillary is not any more hated than Obama by the right, but she's pretty universally loved by the left. And don't let the /r/politics hivemind fool you, the average liberal is going to back her in the general. Too much is at stake with the Supreme Court not to, even if they dislike her somewhat. And then there's Trump. My god, if it's Hillary vs. Trump, this could be the most hated two nominees people could ask for. All the conservatives I know, friends, in-laws, etc. despise him. They will likely sit out before voting for him. And I think there's a big portion of the moderate right who he will not be able to get to the polls, or who may even vote for Clinton. Add a year of obstruction from the Senate on the Supreme Court nomination, and you may have a lot of moderates and independents swinging left. But here's the thing: the parties are possibly the further apart they have been in modern times. You have a conservative party that has swung so far right that it makes previous Republican administrations look liberal by comparison. And on the left, you have a party that grinded against an obstructionist Congress that has a stated goal to let Obama accomplish nothing while in office. Despite that, we've seen massive social reforms and diplomatic endeavors internationally. We've steadily rebuilt a devastated economy. We've ended wars that have cost us trillions. None of these things would have happened under a Republican administration, and we certainly won't see more progress under one after this election. I understand people are fed up, but god damnit, if you can't bother to take a look at what has been accomplished in the last 8 years, all while battling against obstructionism and multiple government shutdowns, I just don't know what can be said. At some point, the people have to take responsibility that it requires more than a vote for president every 4 years. You have to vote in midterms. You have to hold politicians accountable at the local level. There isn't a magic solution to this. Bernie won't fix it. Trump won't fix it. We have to fix it, and it doesn't happen overnight. And speaking of Bernie, can we talk about his base for a second? They're starting to get very fanatical. Frankly, I compare it to the Tea Party for the left. I mean, I get the whole "protest vote" thing, but voting for Trump or sitting out if Clinton gets the nomination? That's just extremism, plain and simple. Politics is about playing the long game. Our entire system is designed for this. Checks and balances, minority representation, etc. Look, I know I'm rambling here, but there's just so much to talk about. The Supreme Court nominations over the next 4 years alone are going to potentially shape the next 30 years of court decisions. No way we're getting money out of politics until Citizens United is overturned, and if we get another Republican, we seal our own fate in that regard, so to speak. In conclusion, folks, this is going to be an interesting election year. The parties are further apart than ever before, and the nominees are the most hated in recent memory. But we have to remember that politics is about playing the long game. We have to hold politicians accountable at the local level. We have to vote in midterms. We have to fix it ourselves, because no one else is going to do it for us.
