Hey guys, have you seen the latest Jurassic Park movie? I recently watched it and I have to say, I was pretty impressed. The dinosaur turntables were a nice touch and really added to the overall experience. But what really struck me was how Hollywood is moving towards a "hype market". As long as a film is watchable and has the ability to tap into nostalgia, it will make a lot of money in its opening weekend. People are no longer waiting to see if a new Star Wars or Jurassic Park movie gets good reviews before watching it. They just want to be a part of the hype and experience it for themselves. Speaking of which, did you know that The Force Awakens beat Jurassic World's US+Canada opening weekend record? However, it hasn't beaten its worldwide box office yet. I'm sure The Force Awakens will eventually be more successful, but Jurassic World has not been completely dethroned yet. In fact, there's an interview in which Steven Spielberg praises the first Jurassic Park movie as being really special and wonderful. It's thematic and explores the conflict between humans and nature. The raptors are the purest form of that conflict - they're basically our 'natural counterpart'. They're smart and work together to do what none of them could alone, just like we do. Muldoon saying "Clever Girl" is his way of acknowledging that nature had bested him. It helps the film drive the message home, while also being a wonderfully quotable line. But let's talk about the dinosaurs themselves. I know there's been a lot of controversy over whether or not they should have feathers. Jurassic Park isn't a documentary, but the first movie tried very hard to be as accurate as possible. Many paleontologists and their fans were hoping that Jurassic World would do the same thing for all of the stuff we've learned about how dinosaurs looked, moved, and behaved since the first movie came out. It's very unlikely that every purported feathered dinosaur we've found died on top of a bird, making it look like they had feathers. Especially since we have feathered dinosaur fossils that predate the evolution of birds. We've found fossils of feathered dinosaurs from so many groups that it looks like all dinosaurs had some degree of feathering (although very large ones may have lost their feathers). That's not to say they would have looked like turkeys - this is probably what most early dinosaurs would have looked like - but they would have had feathers for insulation (just like mammals have fur). I understand that some people are resistant to the idea of seeing a feathered dinosaur in a Jurassic Park movie. As a paleontologist, I'm really interested in helping increase public understanding of dinosaurs. It would be helpful for me to understand why many people are so resistant to the idea of seeing a feathered dinosaur. Would you deliberately not see a non-Jurassic Park movie with feathered dinosaurs because the dinosaurs had feathers? I'm genuinely curious. Now, let's talk about the CGI in Jurassic World. I have to say, I was a bit disappointed. While the dinosaurs looked impressive, there were some anatomical problems that made them look unnatural. The muscles used in the muscle simulation were obviously based on a human, not on a reptile or a bird, and there were also problems with the skeletal structure. I think it makes the animals look inherently 'unnatural'. Additionally, the lighting parameters used for the movie were off. The computer treated the skin as way more reflective than it should have been, giving the animals a kind of sheen that looks decidedly unnatural and clay-like. Reptile scales are really not reflective at all, and they usually don't have a noticeable sheen. Even more brightly-colored animals like a perentie or an anole look pretty drab. The one exception to all of this is when the reptiles are subjected to intense light from a lamp or another artificial source - in that case, they can get quite a bit of reflection going on. But overall, I still enjoyed Jurassic World. It was a fun movie that tapped into my nostalgia for the original Jurassic Park. And let's be honest, who doesn't love seeing dinosaurs on the big screen? I think Hollywood will continue to capitalize on this hype market, and we'll see more and more movies that rely on nostalgia to make money. But as long as they're entertaining and well-made, I don't see anything wrong with that. After all, who doesn't love a good trip down memory lane?
