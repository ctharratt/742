Yo, what's up guys? It's your boy, back at it again with some more ramblings about Dota 2 and RD2L. First off, let me just say that I was totally sober when I made my last post. I don't know what that other guy is talking about with his weak meme. But anyways, I'm thinking about picking up this free agent kid who's ready to shit fuck some noobs. Can he still be drafted as a free agent? I don't know, but I'm gonna try to get him on my team. Speaking of teams, I gotta say that I agree with 659 about how the league should be open. The highest MMR should be the captain and they should get to decide who plays what, not the admins. And can we please flair drama for each division? I'm tired of reading dank maymays that I don't understand. And lapsed, if my opinion matters, I prefer feeding on US east, not in the mountains, not with you faggit. JK, don't downvote me for speaking the truth. And what's up with that one mod right now? Why don't they use something like Flask or Django instead of PHP? PHP is shit, someone with logic could easily win against lapsed. But fine, these were all in the same sentence, I was drunk, but my Antimage made up for it. Hey, do you want to be our Brazilian correspondent? We need someone to keep us updated on the scene down there. And speaking of updates, we need to keep track of every time ransom says "I quit" or "we lost". There will be no quitting, but we need to have statistics on it. And hey, if you want to touch it, it's gonna cost you. $1 to touch it, $2 to watch me touch it, $3 to touch it while I touch my toes, and $4 to touch it while I touch your toes. And if you're interested, we're splitting a hotel for the Dota tournament. I'll be there with the same guys from Seattle, time to win it all. But let's be real, I tried and failed. It's hard to win when your fourth pick is ransom. And speaking of ransom, he owes me nachos because he ate all of mine last night. He was drunk and high, but that's no excuse. And hey, lapsed, do you want me to join PST-SUN so I can rekt you? Sure, I'm down for some easy wins any day. It all starts the night ransom gets more drunk than usual. Put me on team lapsed, I'll carry us to victory. But seriously, worst admin ever. Won't even copy and paste. And we can all grab seats, but I'm still waiting for ransom to pay me back for those nachos. And speaking of pasta, lapsed, do you have a sex swing? I ain't afraid to try it out. And let's be real, I don't care about playoffs. The season was lost when we picked up ransom. But hey, we're going to Dick's for lunch, so it's all good. And let's do something while we're in Seattle. Where are you staying? I'm at the fancy hotel, but not for puking in my room, just to puke elsewhere. And hey, before I started playing in RD2L, I was decent at Dota 2. Now, I'm just shitty. AesirVanir has taught me to never dick like a vaginal pussy fart. But I wouldn't trade my dildo in RD2L for anything, not even a rusty shackleford from ransom's sister. Before this league, I was a nobody. And after three seasons, I'm still a nobody. But thanks RD2L! And ransom sux. Wow, this turned into a long ramble. But hey, that's just how I roll. Peace out, guys.
