I met her online. It was one of those dating apps that everyone seems to be on these days. I was swiping left and right, not really expecting to find anyone that I would actually connect with. But then I saw her profile picture and I was immediately drawn to her. She was beautiful, with long brown hair and big brown eyes. I couldn't believe that someone like her would be interested in someone like me. We started talking and I was surprised at how easy it was to talk to her. We had a lot in common and we seemed to have a similar sense of humor. We talked for a few weeks before we decided to meet up for dinner. I was nervous as hell, but I was also excited to finally meet her in person. When I saw her in person, I was even more blown away by her beauty. She was wearing a simple black dress and she looked stunning. We had dinner and we talked for hours. It was one of the best dates I had ever been on. After dinner, we walked around the city and talked some more. It was getting late and I didn't want the night to end. We ended up sitting on a bench in a park, just talking and laughing. And then she asked me if I wanted to date her. I was planning on asking her that night, but she beat me to it. I was over the moon. I couldn't believe that this amazing girl wanted to be with me. We started dating and things were great. We had so much fun together and we were always laughing. After about six months of dating, we decided to move in together. My living situation at the time was less than ideal and she was looking for a change of scenery. We found a great apartment and we were excited to start our new life together. But things started to change once we moved in together. We started having more arguments and I had trouble communicating with her. I didn't know why, but I just couldn't seem to express myself properly. And then she started to realize that I didn't love her. We never said "I love you" after she brought it up. I didn't know how to tell her that I didn't feel the same way anymore. I had broken up with her before, telling her that she was very reserved and hard to communicate with. But she responded saying that she was that way because she thought I wanted her to be that way. That was a big red flag for me. If you are dating someone, you should never feel like you need to change yourself around that person. The person you are dating should be one of the people in your life you should feel completely comfortable being yourself around. So there I was, living with a girl that I didn't love and couldn't communicate very well with every single day. I don't know why things always seemed so awkward, but there were always quiet pauses whenever we hung out. And then I made a mistake. I flirted with a girl on Facebook and she ratted me out. I felt terrible for what I did, but we were having another shitty slump. The girl that told her what I did gave me the kick to get the fuck out for good. I was so comfortable being where I was, even if the relationship wasn't ideal. My living conditions were pretty nice and I didn't want to give that up. But I needed that push to say enough is enough and quit wasting away in this lonely apartment while the summer blows on by. I could have done this months ago, but she had signed a year lease and I couldn't just leave her with paying full rent. So I stayed. We figured out a financial arrangement now, and I have to pay her rent even if I'm not living there until January. But hey, I'm fucking free at last! I hope that this will give some encouragement to other guys out there who are comfortable being in a 'meh' relationship because it's convenient. I finally feel like I'm free to be myself and create a new life again. I still have to get all my shit out of the apartment, but today is the start of my new life! And I'm excited to see what the future holds.
