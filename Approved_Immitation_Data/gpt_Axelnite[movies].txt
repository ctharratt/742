I recently watched a film that I had heard a lot about but had not seen any trailers or read any reviews before going in. I was pleasantly surprised by what I discovered. The surprise factor was what I enjoyed the most about the film. The film was decent, with Casey and Aaron Paul delivering good performances. The story was average, but still enjoyable nonetheless. However, the film was too long for my liking. At three hours, it felt like it was bouncing around too much, with 60 seconds in one era, 2 minutes in another, and then 10 minutes in another era. It felt choppy trying to keep up with the six stories going on. Despite this, the tone of the scenes was matched across the different eras, which was positive as it kept up the consistency. Overall, I found the film to be too complex and went way over my head. I found it laughable when they made Hugo Weaving look like an Asian man near the end. However, I did partially understand the theme of people being connected from different eras, especially when they shared dialogue. Tom Hanks, as usual, delivered a quality performance, and I couldn't fault him there. However, I have to admit that I have a strong dislike for Halle Berry's face, and I don't know why. Moving on to another film, I recently watched a crime drama that had a great cast, including Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy, and Jason Clarke. They had decent chemistry between the three of them, and Deen Dehaan surprised me with his performance. However, the best performance goes to Guy Pearce, who was unrecognizable and played his evil role fantastically. Another film that I enjoyed was a legal drama that starred Steve Carell and Christian Bale. I found Carell to be the best main actor, along with Bale in The Big Short. However, I was disappointed that Brad Pitt's role was to get more people to watch the film, and he didn't feature more. Ryan Gosling was alright, but I had never seen him in this type of role before. The film was good, but due to the lack of a story or goal, it didn't cut it for me. Moving on to a different genre, I recently watched a film about journalism that I found to be quite realistic. The news reporters were portrayed as ordinary people doing what they care about to help others through the reporting of the truth. Everyone was subdued, which added to the realism. I also recently watched a film about economics that highlighted the corruption in the banking sector. As someone who isn't from an economics background, I struggled to grasp what was going on until the end. However, I found the film to be quite enjoyable, and the soundtrack that went along with it was perfect. Another film that I enjoyed was The Place Beyond the Pines, which I found to be a movie on economics as well as highlighting the corruption in the banking sector. I liked the chef one, which was the only one I understood. I wondered if Margot was thrown in because of her role in The Wolf of Wall Street. The character Bale was playing actually got his company 2.9 billion, which was insane. I wondered where he would get the money from if the whole economy was bust. I also recently watched a film called Locke, which was about Tom Hardy, a phone, and a car. The film told the tale of a man who is making a journey in his life that revolves entirely around phone conversations. It was a decent film that I found to be quite enjoyable. In terms of courtroom dramas, I recently watched 12 Angry Men, which I found to be a masterpiece. I would try to sell this film to someone by saying that it's a tale of a man whose life events have led to this point and come crashing down. It makes me proper chilled, and I love it. It's brilliant for studying. Another film that I found to be captivating from the opening scene was Birdman. The film is about living vicariously, and I would highly recommend it. In conclusion, I have watched a variety of films recently, ranging from crime dramas to legal dramas to films about journalism and economics. Each film had its own unique style and story, and I enjoyed them all in different ways. While some films were too complex for my liking, others were captivating from the opening scene. Overall, I would recommend each of these films to anyone looking for a good movie to watch.
