Well, well, well, what do we have here? Another Top Mind trying to spread their lies and propaganda. I've looked through your post history, and let me tell you, you're not fooling anyone. You're not a Muslim, you're a national socialist. And we all know what that means. Oy vey, and if you don't want shlomo as your guide, it can only be the result of poor penis size! I mean, come on, it's obvious. I saw your post about the rise of antisemitism in the US, and let me tell you, it's not surprising. The Zionist shills and their masters have gone too far. They think they can control everything, but they're wrong. We will drag their bodies in the streets of America if we have to. We will not put up with their tyranny and terrorism any longer. And don't even get me started on Mein Kampf. That book is a load of bullshit, and anyone who thinks otherwise is a fool. Sure, it's now the biggest selling book in Germany, but that just shows how messed up things are over there. Fascism and antisemitism are on the rise, and it's not a good sign. But let's talk about something else for a minute. Have you ever noticed how flat earthers are all over the globe? I mean, it's ridiculous. And don't even get me started on the people who think Judaism is satanic. According to Islam and the Old and New Testament, yes, but that doesn't mean it's true. And let's not forget about the Talmud quotes that are constantly being misquoted. It's just ridiculous. And what's with all the censorship on Reddit? I mean, seriously, people need to be able to express their opinions without fear of being silenced. It's just not right. And don't even get me started on the paid shills. Why would they pay me for something I'm already doing for free? It just doesn't make sense. Anyway, I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. We need to stand up against the Zionist shills and their masters, and we need to do it now. The Jewish have gone too far, and they will pay a heavy price for their actions against non-Jews. It's time for an uprising in the US against them. And if they try to assassinate our leader or rig the elections, it will be the end of them as we know it. So, in conclusion, don't believe everything you read on Reddit. There are a lot of Top Minds out there trying to spread their lies and propaganda. But we won't be silenced. We will continue to speak out against the Zionist shills and their masters, and we will not rest until justice is served.
