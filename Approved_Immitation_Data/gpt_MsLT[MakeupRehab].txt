The world of makeup can be overwhelming, with new products and trends popping up every day. As someone who loves experimenting with different looks, I often find myself tempted to buy the latest and greatest products. But as I've learned over time, it's important to be mindful of what I'm buying and how much I'm spending. One thing that has helped me curb my makeup spending is reminding myself that I've never actually hit pan on a blush, eyeshadow, or foundation before. Sure, I've used up eye and face primers, and tossed old mascaras, but when it comes to actual color products, I've never used them up completely. This realization has made me more mindful of what I'm buying and how much I'm spending on makeup. I love palettes and having lots of options, but I've come to realize that it can take me anywhere from two weeks to a month to use up just one eyeshadow palette, depending on how many products I'm using in a day. And even then, I'm usually only hitting light dips in my most used shades. This has made me more selective about the palettes I buy, and I try to choose ones that have a good mix of shades that I know I'll use. When it comes to individual products, I've found that I tend to stick to the same few items. I have one mascara that I consider my holy grail product, and I'm always on the hunt for other products that can accomplish what it does. This has helped me avoid buying unnecessary products, as I know what works for me and what doesn't. One thing that I struggle with is blending eyeshadow. I've never been great at it, and I often end up with a muddy mess on my eyelids. But instead of buying more eyeshadows to try and perfect my blending skills, I've been working on different techniques with the products I already have. This has not only saved me money, but it's also helped me improve my makeup skills. Another thing that has helped me save money on makeup is swapping products with others. I'm a member of a few makeup swap groups online, and I've had great success trading products that I no longer use for ones that I've been wanting to try. It's a great way to try new products without spending any money, and it's also a fun way to connect with other makeup lovers. Of course, there are times when I do want to buy new makeup products. But when that urge strikes, I try to be mindful of what I'm buying and why. Is it something that I really need, or is it just a passing trend that I'll lose interest in after a few uses? Will I actually use it, or will it just sit in my makeup drawer collecting dust? These are the questions that I ask myself before making a purchase. One thing that I've found helpful is setting a budget for myself when it comes to makeup. I try to limit myself to a certain amount each month, and I make a list of the products that I really want to try. This helps me avoid impulse buys and ensures that I'm only buying products that I know I'll use and love. Overall, I've learned that it's important to be mindful of what I'm buying and how much I'm spending on makeup. By being more selective about the products I buy, working with what I already have, and setting a budget for myself, I've been able to save money while still enjoying my love of makeup.
