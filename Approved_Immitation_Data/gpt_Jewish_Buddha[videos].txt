I gotta say, I'm pretty sick of people treating the elderly like they're children. Just because they need help getting up or walking doesn't mean they're mentally retarded, they're just old. It's like they forget that these people have lived full lives and have a wealth of knowledge and experience to share. But instead, they're talked to in a condescending, child-like tone. It's disrespectful and it needs to stop. I recently witnessed a woman speaking to an elderly woman in this manner and it made me so angry. The elderly woman was all there, mentally sharp and aware, but the younger woman was talking to her like she was a first-grader. It was so patronizing and unnecessary. Just talk to her like a person, for crying out loud. And don't even get me started on the way some people treat the elderly in nursing homes. It's like they're just warehousing them, forgetting that they're still human beings with feelings and emotions. It's heartbreaking to see. But let's switch gears for a minute and talk about something a little less depressing: girl scout cookies. I've never had them before, but I've heard they're amazing. I gotta try them at some point. Now, onto a more controversial topic: free speech on college campuses. I've heard a lot of people say that we should just tell other folks to fuck off and walk away when they say something offensive or hurtful. And sure, that's a good point, but why should people have to put up with it? Why can't they report that kind of crap to administrators? I know some people will argue that college campuses are supposed to be a place where all ideas and perspectives are analyzed, even the ugly ones. And I get that. But there's a difference between analyzing an idea and being subjected to hate speech or harassment. It's not about censorship, it's about creating a safe and respectful environment for everyone. And let's not forget that there are real-world consequences to hate speech. It can lead to violence and discrimination against marginalized groups. So why should we allow it to go unchecked? Of course, there are those who will argue that banning certain groups or ideas is a slippery slope. And I get that too. But we have to draw the line somewhere. We can't just let people spew hate and expect everyone to be okay with it. As a Jew, I know firsthand what it's like to be on the receiving end of hate speech. According to some people's mindsets, we should ban Anti-Israel protesters from campuses because they offend me. According to their mindset, Zionists should be banned from campuses because they offend Palestinians/Muslims. According to their mindset, we should ban conservatives because they offend liberals. But where does it end? If we start banning certain groups or ideas, we risk creating a population of coddled youths who have spent so much time living in echo chambers that they haven't learned how to stand up for anything they hold true or believe in. We need to defend our ideals because they are correct, not because they are protected by censorship. And speaking of defending our ideals, let's talk about meat-eating. I know this is a controversial topic, but hear me out. There is a scientific precedent to show that meat benefitted the development of the human brain. Our ancestors needed the nutrients and protein found in meat to survive and thrive. It's just a fact. Now, I'm not saying that everyone needs to eat meat. That's a personal choice. But let's not pretend that meat-eating is unnatural or immoral. We exist on a planet where life eats life. It's just the way things are. And let's not forget that there are health benefits to eating meat as well. A ketogenic diet, which is high in protein and fats, has been shown to increase the number of mitochondria our brains use to produce energy. Translation? The brain is more efficient and produces more energy-producing mitochondria when on a ketogenic diet. Hence the brain benefits are documented. Of course, there are those who will argue that meat-eating is cruel and unnecessary. And I get that too. But let's not demonize those who choose to eat meat. It's a personal choice, and as long as it's done ethically and sustainably, there's nothing wrong with it. In conclusion, there are a lot of controversial topics out there, from free speech on college campuses to meat-eating. But at the end of the day, we need to remember to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their age or beliefs. We need to defend our ideals, but not at the expense of others. And we need to remember that life is messy and complicated, but that's what makes it beautiful.
