Wow, thank you so much for your reply! It really gives me hope to hear that there are options out there for someone like me who's been out of school for a while. I've been feeling pretty down about my prospects, but your advice has definitely given me some ideas and a renewed sense of motivation. You're right, I think practicing on my own and using the skills in real-life tasks is probably the best way to go about improving my computer skills. I've been trying to do that as much as possible, and I've definitely noticed some improvement already. But I know I still have a long way to go, so I'll definitely look into some of the colleges or programs you mentioned. I'm also really glad to hear that the mature student diploma is an option. I had no idea that was even a thing, but it sounds like it could be exactly what I need to catch up and get back on track. I'll definitely look into that as well. And it's great to hear that you've made friends through gaming! I've actually been doing a lot of online gaming myself lately, and it's been a great way to stay connected with people during these times of social distancing. I'll definitely keep that up and try to use it as a way to practice my social skills as well. As for math, I've been struggling with that subject for as long as I can remember. But I've also been using YouTube to help me out, and it's been a lifesaver. There are so many great resources out there, and I've been able to learn a lot just by watching videos and practicing on my own. I can definitely relate to what you said about your family. A lot of my relatives are pretty similar to my mom as well, and it can be tough to find support from them. But it's great that you have friends who are willing to help out with tutoring. I've been hesitant to ask my friends for help too, but maybe it's time to reach out and see if they can lend a hand. Overall, I'm feeling a lot more optimistic about my future now. It's definitely going to be a challenge to catch up and get back into the swing of things, but I'm ready to put in the work and make it happen. Thank you so much for your advice and encouragement, it means a lot to me!
