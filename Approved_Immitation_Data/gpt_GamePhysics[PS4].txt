Oh man, I've been waiting for this for so long now. Bioshock is one of those games that just sticks with you, you know? I remember playing it on my PS3 and being blown away by the story and the atmosphere. But I never got around to playing the other ones, so when I heard they were coming out for PS4, I knew I had to wait. And let me tell you, the wait was worth it. Bioshock is definitely one of my favorite games of all time. The world-building is just incredible, and the way the story unfolds is so well done. But I have to admit, when I first played it, I didn't really get into the multiplayer. I mean, I tried it out, but it just didn't grab me like the single player did. But then, something happened. My girlfriend started playing my PS4, and she got really into the multiplayer. I don't know what it was, but watching her play made me want to give it another shot. And let me tell you, I'm so glad I did. The multiplayer in Bioshock is seriously underrated. It's so much fun, and there's so much depth to it. I could play it for hours and never get bored. Of course, playing games for hours on end can take a toll on your controller. I had no problems with mine until my girlfriend started using it. I don't know what she did, but the rubber on the sticks started peeling off. It was a bummer, but she got me a new controller for my birthday, so it all worked out. I'm thinking about ordering new sticks for the old one, though, so I can have a backup. Speaking of controllers, have you ever noticed how some people are just fanboys for one console or another? I mean, I get it, everyone has their preferences, but some people take it too far. Like this guy I was reading online the other day. He was going on and on about how Xbox is obviously the better console, and how PS4 is weaker and has worse motion gaming. I don't know where he's getting his information from, but it seems like he's just twisting the facts to fit his own beliefs. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that Xbox isn't a great console. It's just that everyone has their own preferences, you know? Personally, I think PS4 has slightly better hardware, and some games get better resolution and/or FPS than Xbox. But that's just my opinion. And besides, it's not like it really matters in the grand scheme of things. As long as you're having fun playing games, that's all that matters. Speaking of games, have you ever played Jak and Daxter? Those games were my jam back in the day. I would love to see a new one come out for PS4. Or even just more 3D platformers in general. They don't make 'em like they used to, you know? But it's not just platformers that I'm into. I also love tactical shooter open world games with insanely detailed weapon customization. The only problem is, a lot of games get silencers wrong. In real life, silencers actually increase both range and accuracy, but in games, they often decrease them. It's frustrating, because I just want realistic stat changes for weapons and the ability to customize almost any part. Speaking of customization, have you ever played a game with custom maps? I always thought that was a PC-only thing, but apparently it's on PS4 too. The best part is, there are no ads, even if you don't have premium. The only downside is that the layout of the app is kind of confusing. But hey, it works, so I can't complain too much. Speaking of things that work, have you heard about the new VR headsets coming out? I'm really excited to try them out. I know some people are skeptical, but I think they have a lot of potential. Especially on PC, where you can mod games to add VR support. Plus, there's always VR porn, haha. Speaking of games again, have you played The Witcher 3? That game is seriously amazing. I've been wanting some new content to play, so I'm really excited for the upcoming expansion. The only problem is, I'm not sure when my cloud save was uploaded. I've tried everything, but I can't seem to find a way to transfer it to my USB device. It's frustrating, because I don't want to lose all my progress. Speaking of progress, have you played Rainbow Six Siege? That game is seriously addictive. I think JÃ¤ger and Mute/Bandit are pretty essential, but Rook is also really useful. Castle, on the other hand, is one of the least useful operators in my opinion. But hey, everyone has their own playstyle. Speaking of playstyles, have you ever played Payday 2? I got the Crimewave Edition for PS4, but I have to say, the support for that game is non-existent. The hitboxes are so bad that it's barely playable. And the progression is so slow and painful that you end up doing the same couple of heists over and over. Plus, the random unlock system is terrible. I wanted a silencer, but I never got one. Meanwhile, my friend who doesn't even care about stealth got like five of them. It's frustrating, because I just want to play the game the way I want to play it. Speaking of playing games, have you ever played a game that you just couldn't put down? For me, that game was Bioshock. I remember playing it for hours on end, completely immersed in the world. And now that I have all three games on PS4, I can't wait to do it all over again.
