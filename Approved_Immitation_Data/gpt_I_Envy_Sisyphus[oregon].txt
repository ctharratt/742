As someone who has always believed in the idea of worth for worth when it comes to determining an employee's pay, I have recently been grappling with some concerns about this viewpoint. While I still believe that an employee's worth should be a major factor in determining their pay, I have come to realize that there are certain situations where this approach may not be entirely fair or practical. To illustrate my point, let's consider the example of a small business owner who runs an electric company. This business owner has a gas generator that supplies the electricity they sell, and they have one employee who is responsible for turning the generator on and off each day, as well as maintaining it. This employee works a full 40-hour workweek, and their job is absolutely essential to the functioning of the business. Now, let's say that the business owner believes in the idea of worth for worth, and wants to pay their employee based on the value they bring to the company. However, when they start to consider the costs associated with running the generator, they realize that they cannot afford to pay their employee a living wage based solely on their worth to the company. This is where the problem lies. While the business owner may believe that their employee is worth a certain amount based on the value they bring to the company, the reality is that the business cannot function without this employee. Therefore, the business owner has a responsibility to ensure that their employee is paid a living wage, regardless of their perceived worth. This is not to say that an employee's worth should not be taken into account when determining their pay. Of course, an employee who brings more value to the company should be compensated accordingly. However, in situations where an employee is essential to the functioning of the business, their pay should be based on their basic needs rather than their worth to the company. This may seem like a radical departure from the traditional capitalist approach to business, but I believe that it is necessary in order to ensure that all employees are treated fairly and are able to make a living wage. After all, if a business cannot afford to pay its employees a living wage, then it is not a viable business in the first place. Of course, there are other factors to consider when it comes to determining an employee's pay. For example, an employee's level of experience and seniority should also be taken into account. However, these factors should be secondary to the basic need for all employees to be paid a living wage. In conclusion, while I still believe in the idea of worth for worth when it comes to determining an employee's pay, I have come to realize that there are certain situations where this approach may not be entirely fair or practical. In situations where an employee is essential to the functioning of the business, their pay should be based on their basic needs rather than their worth to the company. This may require a departure from traditional capitalist approaches to business, but I believe that it is necessary in order to ensure that all employees are treated fairly and are able to make a living wage.
