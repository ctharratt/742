Naw man, one week for wrestling, christ not all of us watch it live. I mean, come on, we all have lives outside of wrestling, right? But that doesn't mean we can't enjoy the sport and all the drama that comes with it. And let's be real, sometimes it's just more fun to watch it with a group of friends and make fun of the ridiculous storylines and over-the-top characters. But there's one thing that always gets me riled up when it comes to wrestling, and that's the referees. I mean, seriously, why are they always so incompetent? They miss blatant rule violations, they get knocked out at the slightest touch, and they always seem to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. And don't even get me started on the conspiracy theories about certain referees being in cahoots with certain wrestlers. I mean, it's not like they have any reason to be biased, right? They're just there to enforce the rules and make sure the match is fair. But let's be real, wrestling isn't always fair. There are always those wrestlers who will do whatever it takes to win, even if it means breaking the rules or taking advantage of a distracted referee. And that's where the real drama comes in. But even with all the drama and excitement, there are still those moments that just make you scratch your head and wonder what the writers were thinking. Like when The Undertaker and Kane co-held the belt for a bit. I mean, come on, that's just ridiculous. And don't even get me started on some of the storylines involving John Cena. But despite all the flaws and inconsistencies, wrestling still manages to capture our attention and keep us coming back for more. Maybe it's the larger-than-life characters, or the over-the-top storylines, or maybe it's just the thrill of watching two people beat the crap out of each other in the ring. Whatever it is, wrestling has a way of drawing us in and making us care about the outcome of each match. And even though we know it's all scripted and choreographed, there's still a part of us that wants to believe in the magic of it all. But at the end of the day, wrestling is just like any other form of entertainment. It has its flaws and its detractors, but it also has its die-hard fans who will defend it to the death. And that's what makes it so special. So whether you're a casual fan or a hardcore enthusiast, there's always something to love about wrestling. Whether it's the drama, the action, or the larger-than-life characters, there's always something to keep us coming back for more. And who knows, maybe one day we'll finally get that perfect match with a competent referee and a storyline that actually makes sense. But until then, we'll just have to keep enjoying the wild ride that is professional wrestling.
