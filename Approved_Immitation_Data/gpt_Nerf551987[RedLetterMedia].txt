To be perfectly frank, I don't think that anyone really understands the gravity of the situation when it comes to drunk driving. It's a serious issue that affects not only the person behind the wheel, but also innocent bystanders who may be in the wrong place at the wrong time. And let's face it, if you're getting pulled over for drunk driving, that's not exactly the best time to be doing your Louis Farrakhan impression.  But I digress. The point is that storytelling isn't just about going from point A to point B. It's about creating a rich and nuanced world that draws the audience in and keeps them engaged from start to finish. And that's exactly what the geniuses behind Space Cop have done. Sure, it may have taken them 12 years to make, but that's only because they were using time travel to perfect every single scene. Of course, not every story is a masterpiece. There are always going to be bad apples out there, people who are just plain bad from the start. And when those people get behind the wheel of a car, it can lead to disaster. Maybe they'll crash into a wall with a dead hooker in the trunk, beaten to death with the butt of a rifle. Who knows? But let's not get too dark here. We're here to talk about movies, after all. And when it comes to movies, there's no one better than the folks over at Red Letter Media. Sure, they may have a big studio behind them, but that doesn't mean they're immune to the pitfalls of the industry. Just look at what happened to Kindergarten Time Cop 2: Beverly Hills Space Cop Out No. I mean, that's just tragic. But the thing that sets RLM apart from the rest is their dedication to finding the best of the worst. They scour the depths of cinema to find the most bizarre and outrageous films out there, and then they tear them apart with their trademark wit and humor. And let's not forget about the free puzzles and the freezer. I mean, who else is doing that? Of course, not everyone is a fan of RLM. Some people take issue with their use of certain words or their propensity for spoilers. But at the end of the day, it's all in good fun. And if you can't handle a little bit of horse sex or Mexican children being killed by Santa Claus, then maybe you're just not cut out for the world of cinema. But I digress. Let's talk about emulators for a moment. Sure, they may have their flaws, but at the end of the day, they're a valuable tool for gamers and developers alike. And while they may not be able to perfectly replicate the experience of playing on a console, they're still a great way to revisit classic games and explore the history of gaming. And speaking of history, let's not forget about the legacy of Darth Vader. He may be a relic of a bygone era, but he's still one of the most iconic characters in the Star Wars universe. And while there may be some debate about the specifics of his backstory, there's no denying the impact he's had on popular culture. But I'm getting off track again. The point is that we should all be grateful for the work that RLM does. They may not always get it right, but they're always entertaining. And at the end of the day, isn't that what really matters? So let's raise a glass to Space Cop, to Best of the Worst, and to the wonderful world of cinema. Cheers!
