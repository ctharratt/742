I can relate to your situation. When I was 20, I found out that my knee was pretty much screwed for life, and it was extremely devastating. If I hadn't pushed myself and taken my rehab seriously, had I taken my physical therapist's advice when I was 16 and started swimming and biking more, I wouldn't have chronic pain now. Hindsight is 20/20, though. Before anything though, I'd see a specialist and physical therapist. I imagine you'd probably be able to rehab to where you could at least bike and swim and go on long walks. Also, I'd continue weightlifting as long as you're not using your ankle (you'll have to skip some leg exercises, but some exercise is better than nothing). I completely agree - I always make sure that I only eat one portion. I always take them along in a little plastic baggie with me so there isn't any risk of me gorging myself on the whole bag. Honestly, I'd give up running. You've injured your ankle and foot too many times, and it's never going to be back to where it was before you broke it. Look into swimming as a form of exercise. Also, Pilates and yoga can be beneficial when it comes to strengthening. Another option would be to book a session or two with a physical therapist to see what your options are. As much as I hate to say this, you could have messed up your foot for good with the constant re-injuring of it. Also, let this be a lesson to people with injuries. LET YOURSELF HEAL AND LISTEN TO YOUR DOCTOR. My knee is screwed for the rest of my life because I didn't allow it to heal properly after an injury. I was stubborn, kept playing sports and running, and got arthritis at the age of 20. I'm now 28 and while I'm able to be somewhat active with biking and weightlifting, chronic pain is not fun. It's because your body doesn't recognize liquid calories as sustenance. You can drink soda all day and feel like you haven't eaten a thing. Yeah, snacking is a big thing. I lost weight by eating as much as I wanted between meals - so long as it was raw vegetables. I'd factor in an afternoon snack of a handful of nuts as well, but other than that, it's carrot sticks, sliced peppers, raw cauliflower, etc. As someone who loves to eat this has worked well for me. I know it's a different situation, but I experienced severe depression after the death of my father. I joined a gym and exercised regularly, and it seriously helped. It took a little while, but all those regular boosts of endorphins really did get me feeling better. Just stick with it and be patient. Hang in there. When it comes to injuries, it's important to take them seriously. I learned this the hard way with my knee injury. I was stubborn and didn't listen to my doctor's advice, and now I have chronic pain for the rest of my life. It's not worth it. Take the time to heal properly and listen to your doctor's advice. In terms of exercise, there are still plenty of options available to you. Swimming is a great low-impact exercise that can help you stay active without putting too much strain on your ankle. Pilates and yoga can also be beneficial for strengthening your muscles and improving your flexibility. Weightlifting is another option, as long as you're not using your ankle. You may have to skip some leg exercises, but there are still plenty of upper body exercises that you can do. Just make sure to talk to your doctor or physical therapist before starting any new exercise routine. When it comes to diet, portion control is key. I always make sure to only eat one portion and take it with me in a little plastic baggie to avoid overeating. Snacking can also be a big issue, so I try to stick to raw vegetables and nuts as my go-to snacks. Finally, exercise can be a great way to improve your mental health. When I was struggling with depression after my father's death, joining a gym and exercising regularly really helped me feel better. It may take some time, but regular exercise can help boost your mood and improve your overall well-being. In conclusion, it's important to take injuries seriously and listen to your doctor's advice. There are still plenty of exercise options available to you, even with an ankle injury. Portion control and healthy snacking can also help you maintain a healthy diet. And finally, exercise can be a great way to improve your mental health and overall well-being. Just remember to be patient and stick with it.
