Wrong Kyle Williams. Yeah, Romo in the playoffs. I am trembling. As long as Rodgers doesn't have some guys with a magic football come steal his talent like Space Jam style I am not worried. So basically abject failure like the Bears season? Is a bye week considered missing the postseason? How much did you lose this year? No, when Johnson retires he will drop off massively. Consider he broke rules and cheated at USC and got very very lucky last year and fell apart this year. I would say the Superbowl win was a fluke. Ray Rice and Roger Goodell. Wouldnt care who won. I thought sentencing people to hard labor and then torture was illegal? Shit, just imagine if you guys drafted Rodgers from the start. Seriously, I think you might be stupid. That is only 17 million more dollars than Rodgers. So totally worth it. And for the bargain price of 127 million Jay Cutler can be yours for the next 7 years. Rodgers doesn't get enough credit for knowing how to read defenses, he can do it as well if not better than Peyton Manning. Everyone hears the Omaha call from Manning. Rodgers just does it with a look to a receiver. Isn't that what you're supposed to do? Beat the shit out of someone then talk shit? I like Witten more now. Aren't Seahorses stupid water horses? Beating bears in Soldier Field to win Halas trophy is like infinity torments. MNF history with 95 points, GB won 48-47, I shall have to search for a copy of that, I never saw the game, but it was one for the ages. I was just a kid then, in West Germany in the Army, I volunteered for duty that night so I could stay up and listen to the game. Still amazed to this day Washington's kicker missed at the end, otherwise the record would be 98 points. I have this game on a DVD that has the 10 greatest Packers games ever. My Dad loves the game so much that I watched it, really great game. You forget how athletic Joe Theisman was, he was like Johnny Manziel. Fool, That wasn't even his final form. Packers Redskins in the 80's on MNF Theisman vs Dickey. Game was a barn burner and really great. Yeah, Fuck Robert Smith. That guy was garbage. What if I told you the greatest quarterback to ever play for the Redskins had bones make of fried chicken. Please someone make a .gif of Cutler's face after that drop. Dom Capers. Mike McCarthy can't seem to get out of his own way lately either. Should they wait for a Ray Rice situation? I found you today to ask why your much more complete team just lost to Buffalo. Im a Packers fan and I agree. The only reason the Packers won the Superbowl was because Rodgers went Super Saiyan. McCarthy and Capers have held that team back. Just so you know this is a shit fire... RemindMe! Ten Weeks to tell Sawyer he knows nothing about the NFL. Why don't we talk about the past 5 fucking years where we have won the division or freaking Superbowl. Why don't we talk about the Packers coming into Soldier Field and taking the Halas trophy? Why don't we talk about Rodgers to Cobb on 4th down last year? No, lets talk about your dumb ass hunch based on one game. GG Meatball. Why don't you call Bernstein tomorrow so he can berate you as well. You really are insane. And the NFC North is awful. What is your point. Packers lost a game against Superbowl champs during their home opener and had to travel west. Packers are still winning that division and are still a 10 win team. Baktiari had a hold. Led league last year. Lang had a hold. Sherrod was being beat like a drum. Almost made me think Newhouse was back. Lacy ran for 2.8 a carry. Team was at 3.8. Sorry, but the line sucked dicks. Im sorry, we must have been watching different games. The offensive line was garbage. You can stiff arm the face mask. You cannot grab or twist. Justin Tuck looks like Jay Pharoah if he took that stuff Ken Griffey Jr. did in the Simpsons. That would be stupid. Where Shields get caught looking in backfield and blows his coverage? Can we start calling for Capers head yet? What are you talking about? Packers O-line is much improved from last season. Even with a rookie center. Letroy Guion is garbage, and would probably have been cut if Raji was half healthy. Uh. Actually they totally will. I finally got 620 WTMJ and the game to sync. This is glorious. Im sure I'll be reminded at some point in this broadcast. How do I watch the game but listen to Wayne Larrivee instead? Which is weird because we just gave you Worthy. QBR is a bullshit stat. And he is an average starter, of course there will be a drop off with a backup. Nope. He has been pretty poor. And CM3 being out doesn't affect Raji at all. Back shoulder fade. Jordy and Rodgers own the sidelines. Lance Briggs crashing his lambo? Jay Cutler marrying a drama queen? Martellus Bennett doing Black Unicorn things? Brandon Marshall being crazy? Yeah, sorry. Nope. Paul Allen is good. But he isn't even the best radio guy in the division. Bears fans can agree, Wayne Larrivee is amazing. You hear you're dead before you see it as a DB. I am partial to when Rodgers earholes guys. Well, if you also changed the way that profits were spread around the Packers would be surprisingly competitive. The Pack are very high in jersey sales and they have a huge stadium now that always sells out. Sure in the 70's and 80's the Packers couldn't compete, but now their fan base is so huge and the way they do business has changed. Aaron Rodgers to Vikings. Aaron Rodgers to Texans. Aaron Rodgers to most teams. Pretty sure Packers are already contenders. Does anyone have any idea what the fuck we are going to do with all of these insane receivers we just drafted? At best only 6 can make the team. Cobb,Nelson,Boykin,Adams,Janis,Abberderis but they usually carry 5. Do you think Thompson would try and stash Abberderis on the practice squad? He's not even the best ginger punter who played for the Packers. I bet you are extra pissed that he actually turned out to be pretty good. Packers in the last 4 years have 3 division titles and a Superbowl. Not to mention they beat the Bears in Soldier field in two of the most important games in the history of the rivalry. The Packers and Rodgers will win the division until someone proves otherwise. No one thinks this. Actually Rodgers will be elite for probably 8 more years and at least two very good to great years after that. We have a season ticket waiting list long enough to support two more teams. Bryan Bulaga. He won't win because people don't give lineman awards. Sterling Sharpe. He should actually be in the hall. He was the best WR in the NFL for a 3 year period. Jordy Nelson Clay Matthews Lance Briggs Peanut Tillman N. Suh Tony Romo Randall Cunningham should have been in HOF, but Buddy Ryan fucked that up. Bo Jackson should be in hall as like a contributor or something. I feel like he was too amazing. Burned too brightly too quickly though. Edge James Terrell Davis Priest Holmes Charles Haley needs to get in. Julius Peppers is hall of great. Hopefully the next two years he has a rebirth and wins DPOY and gets in. The Green Bay Packers are one of the most successful teams in the NFL, and they have been for a long time. They have won 13 NFL championships, including four Super Bowls, and they have a long history of great players and coaches. But what makes the Packers so successful? Is it their fan base, their business model, or their players and coaches? One of the main reasons the Packers are so successful is their fan base. The Packers have one of the most loyal and passionate fan bases in the NFL, and they have a waiting list for season tickets that is over 100,000 people long. This means that the Packers have a huge home field advantage, and it also means that they have a lot of support when they play on the road. Another reason the Packers are so successful is their business model. The Packers are the only publicly owned team in the NFL, which means that they are owned by the fans. This means that the team is not owned by a single person or corporation, and it also means that the team is not motivated by profit. Instead, the team is motivated by the desire to win and to make the fans happy. The Packers also have a long history of great players and coaches. Some of the greatest players in NFL history have played for the Packers, including Bart Starr, Brett Favre, and Aaron Rodgers. The Packers have also had some of the greatest coaches in NFL history, including Vince Lombardi and Mike Holmgren. But what makes the Packers so successful right now is their current players and coaches. Aaron Rodgers is one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL, and he has a great supporting cast of receivers and running backs. The Packers also have a great defense, led by Clay Matthews and Julius Peppers. And their head coach, Mike McCarthy, is one of the best in the NFL. Of course, the Packers are
