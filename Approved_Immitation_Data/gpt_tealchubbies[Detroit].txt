I recently got a tattoo from Adam at Electric Elephant Tattoo and I have to say, he is AMAZING!! I cannot recommend him enough. Not only is he incredibly talented, but his prices are very fair. Plus, the shop is located in a nice smaller town, which adds to the overall experience. From the moment I walked into the shop, I knew I was in good hands. The atmosphere was welcoming and the staff was friendly. Adam took the time to listen to my ideas and worked with me to create a design that was perfect for me. He was patient and attentive throughout the entire process, making sure that I was comfortable and happy with the design before he started tattooing. And let me tell you, the tattoo itself was a work of art. Adam's attention to detail is incredible. Every line was precise and every shade was perfect. He took his time and made sure that the tattoo was exactly what I wanted. And the end result was even better than I could have imagined. But what really sets Adam apart is his pricing. I've been to other tattoo shops where the prices were outrageous, but Adam's prices are very fair. He doesn't overcharge and he doesn't try to upsell you on anything. He simply charges a fair price for his incredible work. And the fact that the shop is located in a nice smaller town just adds to the overall experience. It's not in a busy city, so you don't have to deal with the hustle and bustle of a big city. Instead, you can relax and enjoy the experience of getting a tattoo in a more laid-back environment. Overall, I cannot recommend Adam at Electric Elephant Tattoo enough. He is an incredibly talented artist who takes pride in his work. His prices are fair and the shop is located in a nice smaller town. If you're looking for a tattoo artist who will work with you to create a design that is perfect for you, then look no further than Adam at Electric Elephant Tattoo.
