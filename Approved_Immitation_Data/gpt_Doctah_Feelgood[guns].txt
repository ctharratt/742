As a gun enthusiast, I have always been fascinated by the Savage Savage rifle. It's a great rifle for the money, and with the right scope and handloads, it can be incredibly accurate. I don't have the cheek riser, but I've heard that it can be a great addition for those who need it. One thing that I've noticed about airsoft flash hiders is that they are often made of pot metal, which can be dangerous if you were to put one on a real gun. I saw one at my local Wal-Mart and almost bought it just because it's so hard to find, but I decided against it for safety reasons. The only thing that I find wrong with the Savage Savage rifle is the optics. They are really front heavy, which can be a problem for some people. My left arm doesn't like mine, but I've heard that there are ways to balance it out. When it comes to purchasing guns, it's important to be honest on the questionnaire. Avoid saying "none of your business" as it clearly means you have something to hide and can raise suspicion. If for some reason they can prove you have guns later, just say you got them after answering the questionnaire. In terms of magazine capacity, it's important to follow the law. With the aluminum magazines I was issued, I would often load 29 rounds in the mag I would insert when we left the wire. It was easier to charge the weapon that way. Subsequent reloads were easy due to the bolt being open, of course. When it comes to optics, there are many options out there. A micro t-1 in a Larue tall mount is 3.7 ounces, and the 3x magnifier itself weighs 7.1 ounces. I think you may need to add another few for the flip mount, but less than a pound and the cost is on par with an acog before adding extra irons or a small RDS. You could also go for an aimpoint h-1 or t-1 with a flip up magnifier, as well. It all depends on your weight requirements. When it comes to purchasing guns, it's important to be aware of straw purchases. Some gun shops have a high rate of straw purchases, which can be dangerous and illegal. It's important to do your research and find a reputable gun shop. I've been watching a lot of political shows lately, and I've noticed that they are often more about validating people's beliefs than informing them. It's important to be aware of this and to seek out unbiased sources of information. In terms of gun accessories, I've been looking all over online for a shoulder thing that goes up. If anyone has any leads, please let me know! It's important to be aware of the legal implications of owning certain guns and accessories. For example, if you have a .458 socom upper and some rounds, you can justify owning a magazine that is marked as such. However, if you are found to have a .223 follower inside, there can be legal problems as it is then capable of holding 30 rounds. As someone who has served in the military, I know the importance of taking care of your gear. I kept all of my mags after deployments, even though the armory guys considered them too beat up to return to service. I switched to pmags before I went to Astan in '09 and brought my own and let them keep their mags. It's important to be aware of the laws in your state when it comes to gun ownership. For example, in New York, there are strict laws regarding gun ownership and storage. It's important to be aware of these laws and to follow them to avoid legal trouble. When it comes to spelling, it's important to pay attention in class. I once had a student who thought it was "rhodes" scholar instead of "Rhodes" scholar. It's important to take education seriously, especially when it comes to important topics like gun ownership. As someone who has served in the military, I know the importance of staying hydrated and changing your socks. It's important to take care of yourself, especially when you are in a high-stress environment. I once had a lance corporal who got an oral STD after he thought it would be a good idea to go down on a hooker in Mallorca. That was...memorable. As someone who has taken an oath to defend the constitution of the United States of America, I believe that it's important to stand up for our rights. There are many green berets, retired soldiers, and reserve units who feel the same way. In terms of gun control, I believe that curbing the production of violent video games and/or movies could open up another discussion about first amendment rights. However, the rest of the letter is spot-on. It's important to have a dialogue about gun control and to find solutions that work for everyone. When it comes to gun ownership, it's important to take care of your guns and accessories. I recently received a barrel nut, a Bravo Co. low profile gas block, and a Vickers extended mag release for my Glock 19 from Bravo Company. I'll have a 6.8 spc upper receiver put together soon. Overall, gun ownership is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and attention to detail. It's important to be aware of the laws in your state and to follow them to avoid legal trouble. It's also important to take care of your gear and to stay informed about the latest developments in the world of gun ownership.
