As a fan of the Star Wars franchise, I have been eagerly anticipating the release of the next installment in the series. While we don't yet know what the title of the film will be, I have some ideas about what it might entail. Firstly, I believe that the title will reference either Kylo Ren, Rey, or both of them together. The dichotomy between these two characters will be key to the film, as they are both currently undergoing training. It's possible that the title could also reference the Force, as it was a central theme in The Force Awakens. However, it's difficult to predict what the title will be since we don't yet know what will happen in the film. That being said, I think that "Star Wars: Children of the Force" would have been a fitting title if the word "Force" had not already been used in The Force Awakens. Moving on to the tone of the upcoming film, I believe that it will be darker and more desperate than previous Star Wars movies. Rogue One, which is set to be released before Episode VIII, will likely set the stage for this tone. The film is set at a time when the rebels have never won a battle against the Empire, and I think that desperation will be a key theme in the movie. I also believe that Rogue One will feature morally ambiguous characters, including rebels who are forced into fighting for survival, traitors, scoundrels, and even Imperial officers struggling with the nature of the Death Star. This is a departure from previous Star Wars movies, which have typically featured clear-cut distinctions between good and evil. I think that Episode VIII will continue this trend, with a focus on the morally grey nature of the characters. Kylo Ren and Rey, in particular, will be key to this theme. Kylo has already demonstrated sentiment in sparing Rey as a child, which could foreshadow their future interactions. It's possible that Rey will bring down Snoke with Kylo's help, creating a sense of rhyming poetry in the story. In terms of the music for Episode VIII, I'm excited to hear John Williams' score once again. The fact that Luke's Theme is back for the first time outside of the intro and credits since the original trilogy is a good sign. I'm also intrigued by the possibility of a Scherzo, which could be a great addition to the soundtrack. As for the plot of the film, there are many theories floating around. Some fans believe that the film will feature a flashback to Luke's academy, which was attacked by Kylo and the Knights of Ren. This could explain why Luke went into hiding and why Rey was left on Jakku for her own safety. Others believe that Finn, Rey, and BB-8 will hide out in the smuggling compartments of the Millennium Falcon, only to be discovered by Han Solo. It's also possible that Phasma will be killed by either Finn or Rey, with Takodana or Starkiller Base being likely locations for her demise. Overall, I'm excited to see what Episode VIII has in store for us. While we don't yet know the title or the plot, I'm confident that it will be a worthy addition to the Star Wars franchise. With talented directors like Rian Johnson and Lord and Miller at the helm, I have high hopes for the film.
