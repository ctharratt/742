As a die-hard Star Wars fan, I have a lot of thoughts and opinions on the franchise. From the original trilogy to the prequels to the latest installment, The Force Awakens, there is so much to discuss and dissect. So, let's dive in and explore some of the most pressing topics in the Star Wars universe. First off, let's talk about Rey's parentage. This has been a hotly debated topic since The Force Awakens was released, and for good reason. The film leaves us with more questions than answers when it comes to Rey's backstory. While some fans believe that she is a Skywalker or a Kenobi, others think that she may be a completely new character with no ties to the previous films. Personally, I think that Rey is Luke's daughter. It just makes the most sense to me, and it would explain why she is so strong with the Force. However, I do think that there is more to the story than we currently know, and I can't wait to see how it all unfolds in the upcoming films. Another topic that has been on my mind is the role of the Jedi in the Star Wars universe. In the prequels, we see the Jedi Order at the height of its power, but by the time we get to the original trilogy, the Jedi are all but extinct. The Force Awakens introduces us to a new generation of Force users, but they are not necessarily Jedi. This raises the question of whether or not the Jedi are necessary in the Star Wars universe. While I do think that the Jedi have an important role to play, I also think that the Force is bigger than any one organization or group of people. The Force is a natural phenomenon that exists whether or not the Jedi are around to use it. Speaking of the new generation of Force users, let's talk about Kylo Ren. He is one of the most interesting characters in The Force Awakens, and I can't wait to see where his story goes in the next two films. Kylo is a complex character who is struggling with his identity and his place in the world. He is torn between the light and the dark sides of the Force, and this internal conflict makes him a fascinating character to watch. I also appreciate the fact that he is not a typical villain. He is not just evil for the sake of being evil; he has real motivations and desires that drive his actions. Moving on to the original trilogy, let's talk about Han Solo. He is one of my favorite characters in the entire Star Wars universe, and his death in The Force Awakens was a real gut punch. However, I do think that his death was necessary for the story. It raises the stakes and shows us that no one is safe in this universe. It also gives his character a sense of closure and allows him to go out on his own terms. While I will miss seeing Han on screen, I think that his death was a fitting end to his story. Finally, let's talk about the prequels. While they are often criticized for their clunky dialogue and overuse of CGI, I still have a soft spot for them. They may not be perfect films, but they are still a part of the Star Wars universe, and they have some great moments and characters. I particularly love the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin, and I think that their dynamic is one of the strongest parts of the prequels. I also appreciate the fact that the prequels tried to expand the Star Wars universe and show us more of the galaxy far, far away. In conclusion, the Star Wars universe is vast and complex, and there is always something new to discover and explore. Whether you are a fan of the original trilogy, the prequels, or the new films, there is something for everyone in this franchise. I can't wait to see where the story goes next, and I look forward to discussing and debating all of the twists and turns along the way. May the Force be with us all.
