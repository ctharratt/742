Usain Bolt is a name that is synonymous with speed and excellence in the world of athletics. The Jamaican sprinter has won numerous accolades and set multiple records in his career, making him one of the greatest athletes of all time. However, there are some who believe that Bolt could have achieved even more if he had focused on different events, such as the 400m. In this article, we will explore the arguments for and against Bolt switching to the 400m, and whether he could have become the world record holder in that event. Firstly, it is important to understand Bolt's background and his strengths as a sprinter. Bolt burst onto the scene in 2008, when he won three gold medals at the Beijing Olympics in the 100m, 200m, and 4x100m relay. He repeated this feat at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, cementing his status as one of the greatest Olympians of all time. Bolt's dominance in the 100m and 200m is unparalleled, with his world records of 9.58 seconds and 19.19 seconds respectively standing to this day. However, Bolt's early career was focused on the 200m and 400m events. He won the world junior championships in the 200m at the age of 15, and went on to win the world youth championships in the 200m and 400m at the age of 16. Bolt's coach at the time, Glen Mills, believed that he had the potential to break the world record in the 400m, and encouraged him to focus on that event. Bolt ran a personal best of 45.28 seconds in the 400m in 2007, but decided to switch his focus back to the 100m and 200m events. So, could Bolt have become the world record holder in the 400m if he had continued to focus on that event? There are several arguments for and against this idea. On the one hand, Bolt's natural speed and power would have made him a formidable opponent in the 400m. His long stride and efficient running technique would have allowed him to cover the distance quickly and efficiently. Additionally, Bolt's endurance and ability to maintain his speed over longer distances would have given him an advantage over other sprinters in the event. On the other hand, the 400m is a very different event to the 100m and 200m. It requires a different type of training and a different approach to racing. Bolt would have had to adjust his training regime and racing strategy to suit the demands of the 400m, which may have taken time and effort away from his other events. Additionally, the current world record in the 400m is held by Wayde van Niekerk of South Africa, who ran a time of 43.03 seconds in 2016. This is a full two seconds faster than Bolt's personal best, and would have been a difficult record to break even for someone of Bolt's calibre. There is also the question of whether Bolt would have been able to maintain his dominance in the 100m and 200m if he had switched to the 400m. Bolt's speed and power are his greatest assets, and these qualities are best suited to the shorter sprint events. It is possible that Bolt's focus on the 400m could have taken away from his performance in the 100m and 200m, and he may not have been able to achieve the same level of success in those events. Despite these arguments, there are some who believe that Bolt could have broken the world record in the 400m if he had focused on that event. Michael Johnson, the former world record holder in the 400m, has said that Bolt has the potential to break his record if he were to focus on the event. Johnson believes that Bolt's natural speed and power, combined with his endurance and ability to maintain his speed over longer distances, make him a strong candidate for the world record. It is also worth noting that Bolt has expressed an interest in the 400m in the past. In an interview with the BBC in 2016, Bolt said that he would like to try the 400m before he retires. He acknowledged that it would be a difficult event to master, but said that he was up for the challenge. In conclusion, the question of whether Bolt could have become the world record holder in the 400m is a difficult one to answer. There are arguments for and against the idea, and it is impossible to know for sure what would have happened if Bolt had focused on that event. However, one thing is certain: Bolt's achievements in the 100m and 200m are nothing short of remarkable, and he will go down in history as one of the greatest sprinters of all time. Whether he could have achieved even more in the 400m is a matter for debate, but there is no denying that Bolt's legacy in athletics is secure.
