Hey there, fellow fandom enthusiasts! Can we just take a moment to appreciate the fact that we are all here, united in our love for Star vs. the Forces of Evil, Gravity Falls, and maybe even Over the Garden Wall? It's truly a beautiful thing. And let's not forget about Steven Universe, the show that deserves all the love it can get. I mean, have you seen Stevenbomb 3.0? It's so good that it pretty much finished off my seven-year-old MacBook Pro. But fear not, my friends, for my new laptop is on its way and I will be back to making reaction videos in no time. Speaking of Steven Universe, can we talk about the giant women? I bet Greg would be thrilled to see them all. And speaking of questions, Steven, please write down all of these questions that I'm about to list off and ask the Gems (and maybe even Greg) each one at the first available opportunity. And don't let them evade the questions, we need answers! It's what we deserve as fans. Now, let's talk about some of the best episodes of Steven Universe. Mirror Gem and Ocean Gem are definitely up there, and they heavily influenced by classic anime. And can we talk about fusions having a game night? I mean, Sugilite being a terrible loser while playing Mario Kart would be hilarious.  For those of you wondering how to watch the episodes, fear not. If you have a cable package with CN, you can easily watch the episodes on the official CN app/site. It's free and the episodes are usually up within a few hours. And let's not forget about the surprises that the show likes to throw our way. We never know what to expect, and that's what makes it so exciting. But let's talk about some theories. What if Rose had fought and bubbled Lion on her own, and took advantage of the Gems not being there to hide him from the others? We don't always see the gemstones, remember the giant pufferfish? And speaking of theories, who else wants to see the Galaxy Warp repaired so that the Gems can take the fight to Homeworld? And maybe even visit a ton of random planets while they're at it. And can we talk about Lapis's VA being a Broadway singer? If there isn't a Lapis song, I will cry more than Steven does over snakes. And speaking of Stevonnie, can you imagine them in battle using Rose's sword and shield, possibly while riding Lion? That would be epic. Now, let's talk about introducing the show to others. My strategy is to show them the song Giant Woman and wait for them to demand context. Then, the bingewatching begins. But for those who need a more structured approach, I recommend showing the following episodes: Giant Woman, Bubble Buddies, Coach Steven, Lion 2, Indirect Kiss, Lion 3, On the Run, Mirror Gem, Ocean Gem, and finishing up with Story for Steven. It makes for a nice sense of story progression. And let's not forget about the new Gems that we may see in the future. Sardonyx is definitely a possibility, but my bet is on a completely new Gem. After Keeping it Together, I feel like this show can keep surprising us. But let's talk about something serious for a moment. What happened that would put this sub at risk? We need to make sure that we are all respectful and kind to each other, just like Steven would want us to be. And speaking of Steven, can you imagine his reaction if he saw a stray kitten trying to follow him home? And let's not forget about the importance of children's literature and media. Kids can handle a lot more than parents think they can, and often the stories themselves help walk young readers/audiences/gamers/etc through mature issues and teach them how to healthily deal with them in their own lives. And finally, let's talk about the books that show up in Steven Universe. I've been keeping a list, and so far we have A Wrinkle in Time, No-Home Boys, Hardy Boys/Boxcar Children, and Nancy Drew. It's always fun to see what books the show references, and it's a great way to introduce kids to classic literature. In conclusion, let's continue to love and appreciate the amazing shows that we are all here for. And let's continue to be kind and respectful to each other, just like Steven would want us to be. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
