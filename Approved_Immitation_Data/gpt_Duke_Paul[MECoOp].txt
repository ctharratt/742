Oh man, I've been thinking a lot about the different classes and variations in Mass Effect lately. Specifically, I've been pondering the idea of pure biotic and tech "sentinels" and what they would look like. I mean, we already have Salarian tech armor users in ME2, so it's not too far-fetched to imagine an Asari with Barrier or a Cabal sentinel with shockwave detonating everything in sight. And let's not forget about the Drell Infiltrator, that dude is like James Bond plus a bunch of explosions.  But what about the "sentinels" we already have? I always felt kind of cheated that they were either tech or biotic, but with "tech armor." (Except for the KroSent and Vorcha, but grenades barely count.) I would have loved to have seen a reave+incinerate variant, or a Salarian sentinel with tech armor, incinerate, and sabotage or something and an Asari with barrier, lash, and warp. Or a Cabal Turian variant with tech armor, cryo blast, and shockwave. Actually...that last one might kinda suck.  And what about Thane? I struggle with him because his weapons say infiltrator, his powers say adept, and his power/weapon balance (capable biotic and weapon user) says ME1-style vanguard. It's just confusing.  But let's talk about the real issue here: the Reapers have all the good tech. Built-in hand-guns, rolly ankles, literal sacks of acid, giant crab claws. Dammit, Alliance Requisitions, where's our cool shit?  Oh, wait, I just got a new Graal shotgun and some muscle amps. Thank you, voice in the background. You are a true champion.  Speaking of champions, have you seen the Armiger Legion Turians? They have jet packs! And they look cooler than regular Turians. Plus, they can dodge. Turians aren't so tank-y that they don't need to dodge.  I've been feeling pretty Turian-y lately, actually. And I like being the only biotic god on this sub, thank you very much. Dragoons? Piece of cake! As long as you're engaging them at range and there's no direct route from them to you. And you have armor piercing. And can debuff or detonate a fire/biotic explosion. And can maintain a clear line of sight on them so they can't sneak up on you. And you can focus on taking them out before they get to you. And there's not too many of them. Yeah, piece of cake.  But let's talk about gear for a second. I didn't realize I was missing so many silver gears until I actually got one one day and now I have all these level V gears and Targeting Assist I or whatever it is. I think gold gears bump two traits (one weapon damage, power damage, power speed, etc.) +12% while silvers bump one trait +15%. I think.  I avoid using consumables as much as possible on Bronze/Silver (it's just not worth it unless I'm running a weak or low-level class/weapon pair). However, it does make a lot of difference on Silver and Gold games, to the point where I won't run without them. But in terms of getting them in packs...I know, right? I want my UR weapons leveled, not +5 medigel or Incendiary Ammo III. Or Stasis/headshot if you need weapon completion points, too. It's so frustrating.  But hey, at least we have the Volus engineer. That little ball of hate is just brilliant. He has two (two!) debuff powers with respectable damage output. He has shield boost as a panic button when you turn a corner and end up in the wrong neighborhood. His heavy melee makes him invincible for a brief, shining, glorious second and then very tough thereafter. And his light melee makes you invisible. Not like crappy infiltrator "cloaks" which work about as well as running around naked shouting "you can't see me, you can't see me!" A real, goddamn, now-they're-shooting-you-now-they're-not pretty much perfect invisibility cloak. Pair him with a nice SMG and enjoy everyone else in your lobby's confusion as you top the scoreboard.  But let's not forget about the other classes. I always enjoy seeing Demolishers and Paladins, though. Such a good feeling. And the Juggernaut popping a turret before going in for a revive? It's like a gentle giant, plus you know whoever he's reviving isn't going back down instantly.  And let's talk about weapons. The Eviscerator is great for its decent damage but good accuracy--headshots are great. The 3-shot clip is great, too. More forgiving than its more damaging cousin, the Wraith (also great). Claymore is awesome, though, once you figure out how to reload cancel. Use Kalence to "build" your character and then try each of your different weapons, see what the damage is, what effect cloaking has, and what effect snap freeze has. You may want to combine this with the one-shot analysis tool u/cymikelee has been building (I believe it's between versions right now, but it's very promising). Great way to tell what you can shoot and run past, and what to double-tap.  And let's not forget about the ladder glitch. I've seen it semi-frequently, but I think it's a lag issue. Although I only noticed it with Vorcha initially, so I thought it was a racial issue--Vorcha are too dumb to use ladders.  In conclusion, there's a lot to think about when it comes to Mass Effect classes, weapons, and gear. But at the end of the day, it's all about having fun and enjoying the game. So go out there, try new things, and don't forget to add me on Origin (my name is different from my Reddit username). Let's top the scoreboard together.
