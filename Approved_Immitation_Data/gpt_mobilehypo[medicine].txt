True, but it's a rollercoaster ride for me. One minute I'm functioning at an extremely high level, and the next I can't even bring myself to shower for days or leave the house. It's a massive crash, and my psychiatrists haven't been able to find anything that works for me. I'm really hoping that I can get approved to try something new. My meds work fairly well for most of the year, but when the seasonal changes come around, it's game over. Nothing seems to work for me during this time of the year. I understand that there are a lot of tests in that panel, but it really depends on the methodology used, especially if it includes indirect fluorescent antibody testing. Thank you for copy-pasting the relevant bit. It's important to understand that this is good information, but it doesn't mean that Ebola is going airborne. I've been following the discussions over in /r/Radiology, and it seems like the rad tech field is in a pretty bad place right now. There just aren't enough jobs to go around. Both Mr. Mobile and I are lab scientists, and we don't think this is a case of mono. If there are no other abnormal cells, we probably wouldn't send it in for path review, depending on the automated differential results and the patient's symptoms. If we weren't in a central lab, we would definitely send the sample on for another manual differential. That's the only situation where those vein finders are worth using. I've had to draw blood from a baby before, even though it wasn't in the NICU, and it was incredibly daunting. I can't even imagine trying to get a line in something as tiny as a premature infant. I agree that most hospitals aren't equipped to handle this type of situation. It's just heartbreaking to see how poorly prepared some of these facilities are. The PPE situation is especially concerning. I just don't understand how it could have been that bad. I feel so badly for the healthcare workers who are on the front lines of this epidemic. The thing that gets me is that it seems like these patients are being treated at the same hospital as the original patient. If I were in their shoes, I would want to be treated elsewhere. Not all hospitals are like this, though. Many have really nice PPE for their staff. It's just an unfortunate statement on what each hospital is willing to invest in. I had amazing PPE training as a lab tech, and I know how to use everything except a SCUBA system. I know about taping, double gloving, and all of that. You can even jerry-rig some pretty amazing PPE with items that are usually just lying around. I worked in a practice that was still using paper records, and we had to manually enter lab results into patient charts. It was nerve-wracking, to say the least. I'm always a little hesitant to get too enthusiastic about certain things. I've had some seriously negative pushback from some doctors in the past. Many of them hear "lab technologist" and assume that I only have a high school education. It's frustrating, but it's just the way things are. I've had a few surgeries in my life, and they've all been pretty intense. The hip surgery I had was relatively short, though, only about 45 minutes. I've also had to wake up intubated from a few of my surgeries, which I absolutely hate. LMAs are a game-changer. I had no idea they even existed until recently. I'm curious, though, how do you know what size to use? It's such a shame that they're out of ZMapp. I hope they can find something else that works just as well. Paths are either really weird or really awesome. Usually, it's the latter, thankfully. Lab food is just a fact of life. Nurses give us a run for our money, though. I apologize if I phrased that poorly earlier. What I meant to say was that she was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, not GM. It's a rare condition, but it's definitely not unheard of. It used to be pentobarbital in some states, but you can't get that anymore. I'm curious about what they're using in these cases. Helium seems to be popular nowadays, but I'm not convinced that it's as peaceful as they claim it is. I've always been fascinated by the field of histology, and I've considered adding a histotech degree to my MLS. I'm currently 38, though, and I'm not sure I have the energy to go through all the craziness associated with medical school. I have a friend who went for his MD at 42 after getting his PhD in infectious disease, and it was extremely tough on him. He's got a way better constitution than I do. In the grand scheme of things, the time spent doing autopsies isn't that significant if you're in the right position. In one of the hospitals in my area, there is a pathologist attached to each sector of clinical labs across the county. They spend most of their time looking at our blood slides, researching lab-related advances in technology, and doing histology stuff. I don't mind drawing blood from people, but I don't want it to be a significant part of my day. I totally understand where you're coming from. Thanks for answering my questions! You MD/PhDs are a special breed. I could never do what you do. I think as long as you can muster some good bedside manner for pre-op, you'd be golden for anesthesiology. Can I ask you a question? This isn't meant to be judgmental at all, but I find it interesting that a lot of doctors don't seem to like patients very much. Did you know that you didn't like interacting with patients before you started medical school, or did you figure it out afterwards? I used to work in IT, and dealing with people all day was one of the reasons I left that field. I just find it fascinating that so many doctors feel the same way.
