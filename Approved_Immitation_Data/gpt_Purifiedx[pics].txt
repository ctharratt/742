My mom always made this broccoli potato casserole that was just to die for. It was like a heart attack of hashbrowns and creamy cheese with broccoli inside. I mean, I would eat stuffing and gravy only (could even go without the gravy) if I had to choose, but this casserole was just something else. It was like a warm hug on a cold day, you know what I mean? Speaking of warm hugs, have you seen Lauren Cohan? She's just gorgeous. I mean, if you cut your hair short, you'd look just like her. I saw her on The Walking Dead and I was like, "Whoa, she's a total badass." I wish I could be like her, you know? Fighting off zombies and looking amazing while doing it. But speaking of malls, have you been to one lately? I was there a couple of months ago and there were children all over the place on these little scooters, getting in my way. I mean, I get it, they're having fun and all, but can't they just stay in one spot? And don't even get me started on those mall kiosks. They're always trying to sell you something you don't need. But I did find something I needed - Skittles with lime! They're back, baby! I bought a pack of Orchards Skittles last week and they're just delicious. There's even a mango peach flavor in there that's really good. Edit: It's peach, not mango. But still, so good. Speaking of things that are good, have you seen this awesome gif of a sketch turning into a finished piece? It's just amazing. The artist is so talented. It's like they've seen the darkest thinking imaginable and still stay strong. I used to draw, you know? I had potential to learn more, but I just never had the time. Life gets in the way, you know? Speaking of life, have you ever wondered about specific climate conditions and how they affect things? I'm in Minnesota, so it rarely gets over 90 degrees. But I wonder how things hold up in other places. Like, if it's really hot and humid, does that affect the way things grow or how they look? I don't know, it's just something I've been thinking about lately. Speaking of things that make you think, have you ever thought about littering and throwing cigarette butts? I mean, I don't do it, but I see people do it all the time. And I get it, sometimes you don't have a trash can or an ashtray nearby, but come on. There are so many considerate smokers out there who put their butts in a water bottle or a Ziploc bag. And it's not just smokers, it's drinkers too. I mean, I've seen beer cans underneath trees at bus stops. It's just not cool, you know? We should all do our part to keep our environment clean. Speaking of doing our part, have you ever had to deal with customer service? I mean, sometimes it's great, but other times it's just a nightmare. My mom has this card that gets her wicked discounts at Kohl's, and all my presents come from there. It's actually a nice deal, but sometimes the customer service is just terrible. I mean, I once had to deal with this guy who was just so rude and unhelpful. It's like, come on, man, I'm just trying to buy a shirt here. Speaking of buying things, have you ever won the lottery? I haven't, but I know someone who has. They got a huge payout, but they didn't get all the money at once. They had to get it over time, which I think is just ridiculous. I mean, it's not like they're going to blow it all in one day. Give them the full compensation, you know? I'd be angry too if I were in their shoes. Speaking of being angry, have you ever hit the snooze button on your phone until it won't let you anymore? I do that all the time. It's like, just five more minutes, you know? But then I end up rushing to get ready and I'm always late. It's a bad habit, I know, but I just can't help it. Speaking of bad habits, have you ever had a spider in your bathroom scale? I did once, and it scared the crap out of me. I couldn't weigh myself for weeks because every once in a while, it would be there... waiting. I wonder now if it left or if there's a dead spider carcass in my scale. Gross, I know, but it's just something that's been on my mind. Speaking of things that are gross, have you ever eaten classic macaroni noodles? I hate those things. They always get stuck on my fork and I hate their little holes. I always go for spirals or shells instead. They're just so much better, you know? Speaking of things that are better, have you ever noticed that men's handwriting is usually chicken scratch? I mean, I've seen some pretty bad handwriting from guys. But my dad has this gorgeous cursive handwriting that I'm totally envious of. I wish I could write like that. Speaking of things we wish we could do, have you ever had to deal with a personal garbage disposal? I have. My boyfriend will eat anything, even my crusts. It's like, dude, those are my crusts. But he just loves them. I guess it's better than throwing them away, right? Speaking of things that are better than throwing away, have you ever lived near Fort Snelling? I did for a while, and it was just so cool. Minnesota is such a great place to live. I mean, we have the Mall of America and the Minnesota State Fair. It's just awesome. Speaking of awesome, have you ever had to deal with expensive-looking girls? I have, and it's not fun. You can't tell anyone that you have money, or they'll just try to take advantage of you. It's like, come on, I worked hard for this money. I'm not just going to give it away. Speaking of giving things away, have you ever had to deal with getting compensation for something? I know someone who did, and they didn't get all the money at once. They had to get it over time, which I think is just ridiculous. I mean, it's not like they're going to blow it all in one day. Give them the full compensation, you know? Speaking of things we should give, have you ever had to deal with a tree screaming? I know it sounds crazy, but sometimes I swear I can hear them. It's like they're in pain or something. I don't know, maybe I'm just imagining things. Speaking of imagining things, have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a zombie fighter like Lauren Cohan? I have, and it would be so cool. I mean, I know it's not real, but it's fun to imagine, you know? Speaking of fun, have you ever had broccoli potato casserole? It's just so good. It's like a warm hug on a cold day. I mean, I would eat stuffing and gravy only (could even go without the gravy) if I had to choose, but this casserole is just something else. It's like a little piece of heaven on a plate.
