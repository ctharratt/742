Hey there, fellow stargazers! I recently had the pleasure of capturing some stunning images of Saturn and the Moon, and I wanted to share my experience with you all. I know that many of you may be interested in astrophotography but may not know where to start, so I hope that my journey can serve as a helpful guide. First things first, let's talk about equipment. You don't need to break the bank to get started with astrophotography. In fact, I highly recommend checking out your local Craigslist or other second-hand marketplaces for some great deals on telescopes and cameras. You can often find some pretty good setups for far less than $500. When it comes to telescopes, I personally use a Skywatcher 102mm f/10 refractor, which at the time costed around $175. However, there are many other great options out there, so do your research and find one that fits your needs and budget. You'll also need a mount to keep your telescope steady, as well as some eyepieces. As for cameras, I use a planetary camera designed specifically for astrophotography. However, you can also use a DSLR camera or even a smartphone with the right adapters and settings. Just keep in mind that the camera is the real tool here, so invest in a good one if you can. Now, let's talk about finding and capturing your subjects. It's not that difficult to find a planet if you have a finderscope, which is a small 'mini telescope' that has cross hairs inside to center an object. A properly polar aligned mount will keep your image nice and steady for any kind of imaging. Look for the brightest stars in the sky, one of them is bound to be a planet! Also, if you have a smart phone, you can make great use of a sky map app, which should show you what you're looking at. There is also a free program called Stellarium which you can install on your PC. When you enter your location, it should show you what you can see in your area! When it comes to capturing your subjects, there are a few things to keep in mind. Focusing is key, so take your time to get it just right. You can use a Bahtinov mask to help with focusing, and make sure your original video is not too bright or too dim. Keep the gamma to the lowest and have about 20% gain. Run your video through Autostakkert or Registax to stack the frames, then process the image in Registax with the wavelets + RGB align, histogram, etc. This will help increase the signal to noise ratio and reveal more detail in your image. It's also important to note that the image you capture may not look exactly like what you see with your own eyes. The image I took of Saturn, for example, is a processed image with a planetary camera. A longer exposure would saturate the detector and you wouldn't be able to see anything but a white blob. Stacking multiple ideal exposures increases the SNR (signal to noise ratio), revealing the detail you normally wouldn't see. Thanks! This was about 300 good frames out of 500. But don't let that discourage you! Even with the most basic setup, you can still get some pretty amazing results. Planets are rather bright, so you can still get very good results in any light pollution, providing the skies are relatively clear. If you want to start imaging the deep sky stuff, a LPR (light pollution reduction) filter is your friend! Now, let's talk about some of the specific images I captured. The blue light from Saturn scattering in our atmosphere is a beautiful sight to behold. The sun has this effect, scattering the blue light all throughout the atmosphere. I also see this effect very well with the Moon on a clear night! This is better known as Rayleigh Scattering. As for the Moon, it's always a stunning subject to capture. I've taken some great shots of the Moon using my telescope and camera setup, and it's always a thrill to see the craters and details up close. Just make sure to keep your exposure settings in check to avoid overexposure. Overall, astrophotography is something anyone can do! Even with the most basic setup, you can get some pretty amazing results. Always check for second hand gear first, good glass/mirrors can last centuries if well kept. Start small and build your setup as you learn. Goodluck! I hope that my experience and tips have been helpful to you all. Happy stargazing!
