Well, let me tell you something, folks. I don't know what kind of kool-aid these people are drinking, but it's not the good stuff. I mean, seriously, who in their right mind would want to be a part of Scientology? It's like they're brainwashed or something. And don't even get me started on their founder, L. Ron Hubbard. That guy was a real piece of work. I mean, have you read his science fiction? It's like he has no emotions or something. And that's probably why he saw people as machines and viewed emotional responses as part of a mental disease that needed to be "cleared." It's just crazy. But you know what's even crazier? The fact that people still believe in this stuff. I mean, come on, folks. Wake up and smell the coffee. Scientology is just a cult that's designed to take your money and control your mind. And don't even get me started on their auditing process. It's a complete farce. They hook you up to some machine and then read the needles to determine where you have emotional scars. It's like they're trying to play God or something. And speaking of playing God, let's talk about the BC and AD thing. I mean, seriously, who cares? It's just a way to mark time. But of course, some people have to go and make a big deal out of it. They want to rename everything and make it all "politically correct." But you know what? It's just a bunch of nonsense. The original terms are fine. They've been around for centuries. Why mess with something that's not broken? And while we're on the subject of things that are broken, let's talk about quinoa. I mean, seriously, what's the deal with that stuff? It always tastes like dirt no matter what you do to it. And don't even get me started on couscous. That stuff is just gross. I'd rather eat oatmeal any day of the week. At least you can jazz it up with some butter and honey or even peanut butter and jam. But quinoa? Forget about it. And speaking of forgettable things, let's talk about soy milk and tofu. I mean, seriously, who came up with that stuff? It tastes like crap. My grandmother used to make us eat it all the time, but I'd rather feed it to the chickens and then eat the chickens. At least they taste good. And don't even get me started on the whole coconut oil thing. There was a media-induced fear of it, but it's actually one of the healthiest oils out there. But of course, people had to go and replace it with corn oil and rape seed oil. And then they renamed it canola oil. It's just a bunch of nonsense. But you know what's not nonsense? The fact that there never was a tribe named Judah. Check your Hebrew, folks. To this day, they call themselves Yehudim. And don't even get me started on the whole moon landing thing. I mean, seriously, some people still think it was a hoax. But I was a child when I watched it live. I heard "for-uh man." In all fairness, it was a man who first stepped onto the moon. Well, this does explain the odd accents I heard up there. Mostly around Bismarck. Check this site out. It's actually fairly accurate. And speaking of accuracy, let's talk about the guitar smashing incident. I tend to agree with the other sources that have it right. It was just a mistake. It happens from time to time. But of course, some people have to go and make a big deal out of it. It's just ridiculous. And speaking of ridiculous, let's talk about the Humboldt Squid. I had never heard of them until today. But apparently, they're known for their red coloration. And they're also known for being about 1500 squid total. I should have looked for more articles describing the incident. But you know what? It's just a bunch of nonsense. And speaking of nonsense, let's talk about the Seventh Day Adventists. I mean, seriously, who cares? They're just a bunch of believers who can be really sincere. But many of them are effed up anyway from earlier experiences that make them vulnerable. In my case, I was used to family being enmeshed in each others affairs, emotional manipulation, using personal history to control people or fear of not being part of a group. Group pressure tactics and shaming. So Scientology represented itself as a science-based approach to self-improvement. But the control methods are much more sophisticated if not subtle. There are benefits. You do get some personal insight. But then there's the whole auditing bullshit. It's just a huge farce with a smear of legitimate science. It's perfect for someone who hasn't learned critical thinking skills. But you know what's not a farce? The fact that there are actually about 1,800 NASA spinoff technologies. But of course, some people have to go and be ignorant about it. They want to raid someone's home and strip them of every NASA spinoff technology. And don't forget to take away their ballpoint pens with the special tip that even China hasn't figured out how to create. It's just ridiculous. And speaking of ridiculous, let's talk about Guatemala. It's another bastion of wonderful native customs. Like burning people alive. But of course, some people have to go and pretend like it's not a big deal. It's just crazy. In conclusion, folks, let's all just take a step back and realize that sometimes things are just a bunch of nonsense. But other times, they're not. It's up to us to figure out which is which. And that's all I have to say about that.
