By the way, I just want to say that I am not a fan of the automoderator. It's like, who made this thing the boss of me? I mean, I get it, we need rules and regulations, but sometimes it feels like we're just being controlled by machines. And speaking of control, let's talk about loopholes. Closing loopholes is so important because it's like, if we don't, then companies are just going to cheat their way out of following the laws we set up for them. It's like if I tell you that club dues are 50 bucks, but then I say, "Oh, but if you eat at the restaurant once, you earn points to get 50 bucks back," then are you really out 50 bucks or not? It's just confusing and unfair. We need to simplify things and just say, "Club dues are 20 bucks." It's like, why make things more complicated than they need to be? And don't even get me started on supply side economics. I mean, I know some people swear by it, but I just don't think it's the answer to all our problems. We need to find a balance between helping businesses and helping individuals. And speaking of individuals, I don't think the Republican party is for everyone. I mean, if you're all about big corporations and not caring about the little guy, then sure, go ahead and vote Republican. But if you actually care about people and their rights, then maybe you should look elsewhere. And let's talk about taxes. I think we need to drastically lower corporate taxes. I mean, it's just absurd how high they are. And if we don't lower them, then businesses are just going to leave for greener pastures. But at the same time, we need to have safeguards in place to prevent corporations from getting too big and powerful. We need to find a balance between helping businesses and protecting individuals. And speaking of individuals, I'm much more scared of Trump's cowboy dictatorship style than I would be of Cruz doing something unconstitutional. I mean, at least Cruz knows the Constitution and what it limits. And I think a lot of the hate for him comes from him talking about his religion in a time when many people don't want to hear about it. But hey, at least he isn't going to a church that preaches Black Liberation theology. And let's talk about the candidates. I mean, I know everyone has their favorites, but I just don't see how anyone could vote for Trump. I mean, the guy is clearly more interested in himself than anyone else. And don't even get me started on his insults and name-calling. It's just not presidential. And as for Rubio, I think he's been groomed by the establishment. I mean, he's like Obama was when he ran - a Senator without a real record. But if he gets the nomination, I'll still vote for him. I mean, he's better than Trump, right? And let's talk about healthcare. I mean, it's a mess, right? But I think Cruz did a pretty nice takedown on the issue. I mean, calling Trump out for praising Scotland's system? That was pretty good. And let's not forget about the Little Sisters of the Poor. I mean, religious liberty is under attack, and we need to protect it. And finally, let's talk about the debates. I mean, I've watched every single one, and I have to say, Rubio was masterful tonight. I mean, he really took it to Trump on the issue of healthcare. And Cruz was great too, but I don't think he hurt himself much with his supporters. And as for Carson and Kasich, well, they just didn't get as much time. But hey, at least they were there, right? In conclusion, we need to simplify things, close loopholes, lower corporate taxes, protect religious liberty, and find a balance between helping businesses and protecting individuals. And as for the candidates, well, I think we need to look beyond the insults and name-calling and focus on who will actually do the best job. And that's all I have to say about that.
