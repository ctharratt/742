The return of Georges St-Pierre to the UFC has been a topic of discussion for quite some time now. Fans have been eagerly waiting for the former welterweight champion to make his comeback to the octagon. And now, it seems like their wait is finally over. GSP has announced that he will be returning to active competition in the UFC, and fans couldn't be more excited. But with his return, comes the question of who he will face in the welterweight division. Many fans are wondering if GSP will be able to hang with the current crop of fighters in the division. Some have even gone as far as to say that the division has changed so much since GSP last fought that he won't be able to compete at the same level as before. But is that really the case? Let's take a look at the current welterweight division and see who GSP could potentially face. First up, we have the current champion, Kamaru Usman. Usman has been on a tear lately, and many consider him to be one of the best welterweights in the world. But is he really a threat to GSP? It's hard to say. Usman is a great wrestler and has some heavy hands, but GSP has faced wrestlers and strikers of Usman's caliber before and come out on top. It would definitely be an interesting matchup, but I don't think Usman poses a significant threat to GSP. Next up, we have Colby Covington. Covington is another wrestler with some decent striking, but he's also known for his trash-talking and controversial statements. While he's certainly a talented fighter, I don't think he's on the same level as GSP. Covington has yet to face a top-tier opponent and has only recently started to gain some recognition in the division. GSP, on the other hand, has faced and defeated some of the best fighters in the world. I don't see Covington posing much of a threat to GSP. Moving on, we have Jorge Masvidal. Masvidal has been on a roll lately, with impressive wins over Darren Till and Ben Askren. He's also known for his striking and has some of the best hands in the division. But again, I don't think he's on the same level as GSP. Masvidal has struggled against wrestlers in the past, and GSP is one of the best wrestlers in the division. I think GSP would be able to take Masvidal down and control him on the ground. Then we have Leon Edwards. Edwards is a talented fighter with a well-rounded game, but he hasn't faced anyone on the level of GSP. He's also struggled against wrestlers in the past, which doesn't bode well for him against GSP. While Edwards is certainly a tough opponent, I don't think he's a significant threat to GSP. Finally, we have Tyron Woodley. Woodley is a former welterweight champion and has some of the best wrestling and striking in the division. He's also known for his knockout power and has finished some of the best fighters in the world. But again, I don't think he's on the same level as GSP. Woodley has struggled against wrestlers in the past, and GSP is one of the best wrestlers in the division. I think GSP would be able to take Woodley down and control him on the ground. So, who does that leave? Well, there are a few fighters that GSP hasn't faced yet, such as Robbie Lawler and Demian Maia. Lawler is a former welterweight champion and has some of the best striking in the division. He's also known for his toughness and durability. Maia, on the other hand, is a submission specialist and has some of the best grappling in the division. Both fighters would pose unique challenges to GSP, but I think he would be able to handle them. In conclusion, I don't think the welterweight division has changed much since GSP last fought. While there are certainly some talented fighters in the division, I don't think any of them pose a significant threat to GSP. He's faced and defeated some of the best fighters in the world, and I don't see why he wouldn't be able to do it again. GSP is one of the greatest fighters of all time, and I can't wait to see him back in the octagon.
