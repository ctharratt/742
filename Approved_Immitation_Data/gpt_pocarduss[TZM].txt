Hey guys, it's me. I just wanted to chime in on this whole debate about demolishing our current cities and building new ones. Personally, I think it's a bit extreme. I mean, have you ever walked through the streets of London or Paris and just been transported to another time? It's magical. And I don't want future generations to miss out on that. Sure, there are some ugly and horrible cities out there that could use a good knocking down. But why demolish the beautiful ones? We should be preserving them for educational and remembrance purposes. And let's not forget about the historical value of these cities. They remind us of where we all came from collectively. Now, I know some people are all about building new, fresher cities. And don't get me wrong, I think that's a great idea too. But why can't we have both? Why can't we have all different kinds of living areas, including some of the important old cities? And let's talk about resources for a minute. Some people argue that demolishing our current cities and using the resources to build new ones is the way to go. But I think that's a huge waste of time. The resources used to build these cities may be inferior, but that doesn't mean we should just throw them away. And if we were going to abandon our current cities, it would be more interesting to see how nature takes care of them. Now, I know some people are all about Jacque Fresco's idea of transforming the surface of the earth in 10 years. But let's be real, that's a bit absurd. We have so many other problems to fix as a species before we even think about demolishing our cities. And even then, we should be preserving the best ones and knocking down the ugly ones. And let's not forget about the pre-built infrastructure we already have in our cities. It's there for us to work with in the future. And contrary to what some people in this movement and others say, buildings made to fail on purpose is just plain wrong according to professionals in engineering fields. So, what do you guys think? Should we knock down our current cities and just improve them as well as building new ones? Or should we preserve the best ones and knock down the ugly ones while also building new ones for people who want to live in them? I personally think it's not that important of an issue, in fact, it's probably the smallest of all our problems as a species. But it's still worth discussing. And let's not forget about the UNESCO world heritage sites list. It's not perfect, but it's a start. We can use it to determine which structures and buildings need to be kept even if some cities are demolished. I've lived in New York for a while and the living quality was quite good. But now I'm living in London and it's even better. I'm sure there are people who agree with me, but I know it's not that important. What's important is that we preserve the best cities we have now and build new ones for people who want to live in them. In conclusion, I think we should preserve the best cities we have now and knock down the ugly ones while also building new ones for people who want to live in them. We should also preserve some of the historically important cities that we have to remember where we all came from collectively. And let's not forget about the pre-built infrastructure we already have in our cities. It's there for us to work with in the future.
