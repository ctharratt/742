Yo, what's up fellow Hearthstone players? It's your boy here, and I gotta say, I'm loving this week's Tavern Brawl. I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' game of "Too Many Portals"? It's like Christmas morning, except instead of presents, you get random minions popping out of portals left and right. And let's not forget about the spiders, man. Those little guys are just too cute to handle.  But, let's be real here, there are some issues with the game that need to be addressed. I mean, have you ever been in the middle of a game and suddenly your opponent's turn takes forever? Like, what are they doing over there? Taking a nap? It turns out, there are some serious latency issues with Hearthstone. I've started using Hearthstone Deck Tracker, and it's crazy how much faster I am than my opponent. I mean, I'm already connected to the server and have my card draws determined, while they're still waiting for the wheel to stop spinning.  And don't even get me started on the animations. I get it, they're there to hide the lag between players, but sometimes they just take too long. Like, I don't need to see every single minion attack animation, just get on with the game already. And speaking of animations, can we please make it so that when the "end turn" button is pushed, all animations stop? I mean, the effects can all be found in the History bar if anyone is confused as to what happened.  But, let's not forget about the real issue here: building a viable deck. I mean, some of us just can't seem to get it right. It's even worse with the randomly generated stuff like this week's Brawl, because sometimes you do everything you can, and still get pummeled massively. And don't even get me started on the Shaman class. When does overload NOT screw them over?  But, I have a theory. Maybe Blizzard is working on a "Hearthstone 2.0" behind the scenes, and that's why they're not fixing things like deck slots. They know that the whole codebase is changing in the future, so any excessive time spent fixing the current code gets thrown away when it's replaced by the 2.0 code. It's just a theory, but it makes sense to me.  And let's talk about the coin for a second. There seems to be some confusion about how it works. Let me clear it up for you: the Coin DOES refill a used crystal, as long as you've already spent mana that turn. Innervate works the same way. Once you've already spent mana, it absolutely is how it works. I mean, have you ever played this game?  But, let's get back to the real issue at hand: the lack of a permanent practice mode. I mean, come on Blizzard, we need this. I would still pay for arena entries so I could earn actual rewards, but it would be nice to be able to get better at arena without blowing loads of money/gold on entries where I go 3-3 or worse.  Overall, Hearthstone is a great game, but there are definitely some issues that need to be addressed. Let's hope Blizzard is listening and working on fixing them. Until then, I'll be over here playing my Annoy-O-Tron in the Tavern Brawl, hoping for some good portal luck. Peace out, Hearthstone fam.
