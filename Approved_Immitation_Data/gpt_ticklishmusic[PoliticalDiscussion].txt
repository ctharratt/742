As the race for the Democratic nomination heats up, it's important to take a closer look at the candidates and their records. While many people focus solely on their time in Congress, it's important to consider their entire career and the actions they've taken outside of politics. In the case of Hillary Clinton, her record outside of Congress is quite impressive. She started off in a law clinic doing work for disadvantaged children, showing her dedication to helping those in need from the very beginning of her career. She also went undercover to research racial discrimination in the south, further demonstrating her commitment to fighting for equality and justice. Clinton has also been a strong advocate for healthcare, particularly for children. She pushed for mandatory vaccinations and was a key player in the Clinton administration's efforts to reform healthcare. Additionally, she has been a vocal supporter of AIDS research and was the first to appoint openly LGBT individuals to government positions. Throughout her career, Clinton has been a champion for human rights worldwide. Her infamous women's rights speech in China and more recent advocacy for LGBT rights in Africa are just a few examples of her dedication to promoting equality and justice on a global scale. As Secretary of State, Clinton pushed hard for closing Guantanamo Bay and gave LGBT couples full benefits. While some may argue that she pivoted towards the center as a strategic move to get elected, her record outside of Congress shows that she has always been a progressive at heart. While some may criticize Clinton for her ties to Wall Street and big donors, it's important to note that her donor base is not just made up of wealthy individuals. Middle class Americans who support her are starting to step up and donate, showing that she has a broad base of support. On the other hand, Bernie Sanders has been gaining momentum with his message of political revolution and his focus on income inequality. While his record in Congress is impressive, it's important to consider his actions outside of politics as well. Sanders has been a vocal advocate for civil rights and social justice throughout his career. He was arrested during a civil rights protest in the 1960s and has been a consistent supporter of LGBT rights. Additionally, he has been a strong advocate for healthcare reform and has pushed for a single-payer system. However, some have criticized Sanders for his lack of foreign policy experience. While he has been vocal about his opposition to the Iraq War and has called for a more restrained foreign policy, it's unclear how he would handle complex international issues as president. It's also worth noting that Sanders has been criticized for his campaign tactics. While he has not engaged in direct attacks on Clinton, he has insinuated and suggested her dishonesty, allowing his more overzealous supporters and Republicans to do the actual smearing. Ultimately, the choice between Clinton and Sanders comes down to which candidate voters believe is best equipped to lead the country. While Sanders' message of political revolution is inspiring, Clinton's experience and record of progressive action make her a strong candidate as well. As the race for the Democratic nomination continues, it's important to remember that the ultimate goal is to defeat the Republican nominee in the general election. While some may argue that a vote for Sanders is a vote for Trump, it's important to consider the issues and the candidates' records before making a decision. In the end, the choice between Clinton and Sanders is not just about who can win the nomination, but who can lead the country and make a positive impact on the lives of all Americans.
