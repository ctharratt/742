I took this picture the other day and I'm not sure if they have managed to keep that on there for this long or if it was supposed to say 2016 and they don't know how to write it. It's a strange thing to see, a number etched into wood, seemingly defying the passage of time. But then again, maybe it's just a mistake, a typo that no one bothered to correct. It's funny how something so small can make you question everything. Yes, that too but I don't think he will. He didn't even notice it until a week after the burn. He likes it. It's sprinkles briefly here in Oakland. It's dry now. Multipa- throws up in mouth Nope. Buddy I was with and I couldn't believe it at first. We inspected it and I got a couple of other pics wider shots and with him pondering what happened. None of them as cool as this pic turned out though. Just an odd happenstance of a leaf tip sticking in wood and someone witnessing it. Disbelieve if you'd like but it happened. It's funny how we can find beauty in the most unexpected places. A leaf tip sticking in wood, a number etched into a tree, these are things that most people would overlook. But for some reason, they catch our eye and we can't help but marvel at them. Maybe it's because they remind us that even the smallest things can have an impact. I went to a Philz once two years ago. I approached the girl at the register and attempted to place an order and she cut me off and said, "Please have a seat and a brewing specialist will be right with you." I couldn't have walked out faster.  Sometimes, the simplest things can be the most frustrating. All you wanted was a cup of coffee, but instead, you got a lecture on the art of brewing. It's moments like these that make you wonder if the world has gone mad. Theodore Roosevelt approves of this post.  It's always nice to have a little bit of validation, even if it's from someone who's been dead for over a century. But then again, maybe that's the beauty of it. Roosevelt's words still resonate today, reminding us that even in a world that's constantly changing, some things never go out of style. That the stupid bitch from bitch perfect?  It's amazing how one movie can have such an impact on our culture. "Pitch Perfect" may have been a silly comedy, but it's become a cultural touchstone, with lines from the movie popping up in everyday conversation. It just goes to show that sometimes, the things that seem the most trivial can have the biggest impact. Still got mine! And those chicken nuggets with the outfits.  There's something comforting about holding onto things from our past. Maybe it's because they remind us of a simpler time, or maybe it's just because they make us feel good. Either way, it's nice to have something to hold onto, even if it's just a memory. Am I the only one that doesn't see it?  It's funny how we can all look at the same thing and see something different. Maybe it's because we all have our own unique perspectives, or maybe it's just because we're all a little bit crazy. Either way, it's what makes life interesting. Or this shows how staged a photo can be, this act was done to show contempt for the police. You're a fool if you think otherwise. Pull the cops out and let these morons tear their own neighborhoods down.  It's easy to get caught up in the moment, to let our emotions get the best of us. But when we start to demonize entire groups of people, we lose sight of what's really important. We forget that we're all human, that we all have our own struggles and fears. Maybe it's time to start listening to each other, instead of shouting over each other. The crater produced a cellist?!  It's amazing how one small event can have such a big impact. A crater in the ground, a leaf tip sticking in wood, these are things that seem insignificant, but they can change the course of someone's life. Maybe it's because they remind us that even the smallest things can have an impact. Was anyone lucky enough to get a one way trip out of Ohio?  Sometimes, we just need to get away. Whether it's from a bad situation or just the monotony of everyday life, a change of scenery can do wonders for the soul. Maybe it's time to take that trip you've been dreaming of, to see the world and all its wonders. If you've never been to Long Beach, CA and want an amazing treat go stay on the first Queen Mary for a couple night and wander the halls after some drinks. It's terrifying and awesome!  There's something magical about old buildings, something that makes us feel connected to the past. Maybe it's the history, or maybe it's just the feeling of being somewhere that's seen so much. Either way, it's an experience that's worth having. Why doesn't just walk around all that bullshit?  Sometimes, the simplest solutions are the best. We spend so much time trying to complicate things, when all we really need to do is take a step back and look at the situation from a different angle. Maybe it's time to start thinking outside the box. That's a good way to kill someone with a soy allergy.  It's amazing how something as simple as a food allergy can have such a big impact on someone's life. We take so many things for granted, like being able to eat whatever we want, but for some people, it's a constant struggle. Maybe it's time to start being a little more mindful of the things we take for granted. I applaud the effort. Sounds like a great guy. Thanks for sharing him with us. I'd love to have met him.  It's always nice to hear about someone who's doing good in the world. Maybe it's because it gives us hope, or maybe it's just because it reminds us that there are still good people out there. Either way, it's a reminder that we all have the power to make a difference. It lasted about two months the first two weeks being absolutely miserable, didn't sleep much. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I never told them and I didn't want the detox drug, I just wanted to be left alone and to deal with it. Quit smoking as well, 15 years on and that two addictions cold turkey at the same time. I honestly don't know how I didn't go insane or maybe I did. Addiction is a powerful thing. It can take over your life, leaving you feeling helpless and alone. But it's important to remember that you're not alone, that there are people out there who can help. Maybe it's time to start reaching out, to start taking those first steps towards recovery. It won't be easy, but it's worth it.
