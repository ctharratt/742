Hey there fellow Gearheads! I was just browsing through some of the threads on this subreddit and came across some interesting discussions about Gears of War. As a long-time fan of the series, I thought I'd chime in with my own thoughts and experiences. First off, I have to say that I am not the best player when it comes to Gears of War. I've never had a quick trigger finger and I can't shoot that fast to save my life. But that doesn't stop me from enjoying the game and having a blast with my friends. Speaking of friends, I recently found out about the promotion where if you play Gears of War: Ultimate Edition before the end of the year, you'll get access to the Gears of War 4 Beta, as well as downloads of every Gears game (1, 2, 3, and Judgment) when backwards compatibility becomes available. I'm pretty excited about this, as I've played all of the games except for Judgment and can't wait to go through them all again. One thing I've noticed about Gears of War is that it's not just about skill, but also about strategy. For example, I've found that it can be a good move to look like a member of the other team in order to catch them off guard. Of course, this can backfire if your own team accidentally shoots you, but for the most part, it's a tactic that can pay off. Another thing I've noticed is that the color scheme of some characters can make a difference on lighter or darker maps. I'm not sure if this is just in my head, but it's something I've been paying attention to lately. In terms of the different games in the series, I would say that my favorite is the original Gears of War. Nostalgia may play a factor here, as it was my first multiplayer game ever and I spent countless hours on it back in the day. But I also love the story-line and the look of the gore in that game. I also really enjoyed Gears of War 3, especially after they fixed the multiplayer. I wasn't a fan of the multiplayer in Gears of War 2, but they definitely improved it in the third game. As for Gears of War: Judgment, I haven't played it yet but I'm looking forward to it when backwards compatibility becomes available. I've heard mixed reviews about it, but I'm willing to give it a chance. In terms of the multiplayer, I've had some frustrating experiences with the matchmaking. It can take forever to find a game, and then once you finally get into one, you have to wait another 20 seconds for it to start. I don't have a lot of free time, so I'd like to maximize my playing time when I get the chance. I've also noticed that the Gnasher seems to get more headshots in Gears of War: Ultimate Edition than it used to. I'm not sure if this is just me or if others have noticed it too. In terms of tips for lining up blindfires better, I'm not the best person to ask. I've never been great at blindfiring, but I've found that practicing and getting a feel for the game can help. I also used to be a beast with the sniper no scopes in the original Gears of War, but somehow lost my touch. Maybe I'm overthinking every shot? Need more practice? I'm not sure, but I'd love to get back to my old sniping skills. Finally, I think it's a great idea to have user-created maps in Gears of War. Some of my favorite maps in other games like Halo 3 and GTA V (Races) were user-created, and I think it would be awesome to see what the community can come up with for Gears of War. Overall, I'm a huge fan of the Gears of War series and can't wait to see what they come up with for Gears of War 4. I may not be the best player, but I still have a blast playing with my friends and experiencing the story-line. And who knows, maybe I'll even improve my skills with some more practice.
