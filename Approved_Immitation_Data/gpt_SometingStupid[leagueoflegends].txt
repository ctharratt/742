League of Legends is a game that has taken the world by storm. It is a multiplayer online battle arena game that has captured the hearts of millions of players worldwide. The game is free to play, but players can purchase in-game items to enhance their gameplay experience. The game has a steep learning curve, but once players get the hang of it, they find it to be an incredibly rewarding experience. One of the most interesting aspects of League of Legends is the queue system. The queue system is a way for players to find other players to play with. There are different types of queues, such as ranked and normal. The queues are designed to match players with others of similar skill levels. This ensures that the games are fair and balanced. There are also queues purely for fun. These queues are designed to be more relaxed and less competitive. They are a great way for players to unwind and have some fun with friends. The queues upgrade automatically at level 9, but players can pay 475 gold to upgrade them even further. The team captain can choose to refuse people who do not fit the team. This is a great feature because it ensures that the team is balanced and has the best chance of winning. The team captain will get a notification saying "Summoner x is playing Champion y in Role Z, Allow or Refuse?" If it doesn't fit the team, they'll hit refuse and you'll be sent merrily on your way to another team. The game has different levels of play, such as Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond. Each level has its own unique challenges and rewards. Bronze is Game of Thresh Bans, Silver is Game of Thrash Keyboards, Gold is Game of Throws, Platinum is Game of Thrones, and Diamond is "lolwut, abandon the metaphor." One interesting aspect of the game is the way that crit chance works. Not landing a crit raises your chance of hitting one as long as you have some crit chance. This is because the game doesn't round at all, even though it appears to while in-game. Especially crit chance, which is cumulative. Not getting a crit while you have 0.28% chance adds another 0.28% chance until you get a crit, then it resets. Ergo, having 50% crit chance and not getting a crit on the first hit ensures a crit on the second. League of Legends is often compared to Dota 2. Dota 2 is a similar game that has a large following. However, there is some confusion about whether Dota 2 is a sequel to Dota. Some people believe that it is, while others do not. Valve, the company that makes Dota 2, hired the person who makes the current Dota. There's no copyright infringement in this, there never has been. It's not copyright infringement, it's just a move that tries to pull the wool over people's eyes. No one believes that Icefrog owns the Dota franchise. He's just the person that updates the most recent Dota patch and has done it pretty well. League of Legends and Dota 2 are both great games, but they have their differences. League of Legends has a more streamlined gameplay experience, while Dota 2 has a more complex gameplay experience. Both games have their strengths and weaknesses, and it's up to the player to decide which one they prefer. One of the most interesting aspects of League of Legends is the skin creation process. Skins are cosmetic items that change the appearance of a champion. The skins are created by different people, and this can lead to inconsistencies in quality. Some skins are amazing, while others are lackluster. This is because different people have different views on what constitutes a good skin. The inconsistencies in quality come from different views on what constitutes a 750RP skin inside Riot. If someone thinks that the skin should just be a re-skin with new splash art (such as TPA Ezreal) then fine, they've hit their target and whatever, good job to them. But if someone goes and does more like with the Mundo skin, Riot aren't going to strip away their hard work because it's too good. The Shen skin is probably unfinished due to time constraints, and a few tweaks to it would be nice, although Riot don't have to do anything. It's interesting to note that the more used character gets a more inconsistent skin. Plus, to extrapolate, if he's more used you'd imagine more people have him, which means more potential skin buyers, so the character with the more potential to turn a profit gets a lesser skin? Logically, that doesn't make sense. Just a lack of foresight, I think. In conclusion, League of Legends is a great game that has captured the hearts of millions of players worldwide. The game has a steep learning curve, but once players get the hang of it, they find it to be an incredibly rewarding experience. The queue system is a great way for players to find other players to play with, and the different levels of play provide unique challenges and rewards. The skin creation process is interesting, but it can lead to inconsistencies in quality. Overall, League of Legends is a great game that is worth playing.
