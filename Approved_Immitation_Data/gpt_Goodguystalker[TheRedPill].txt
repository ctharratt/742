I have to say, I'm a bit baffled by some of the things I've seen on TRP lately. I mean, I get it, I really do. I understand the appeal of wanting to feel like you're in control, like you have some sort of power over the opposite sex. But some of the conclusions people are jumping to are just insane. For example, the idea that race doesn't matter. I mean, come on. That's just ridiculous. Of course race matters. It's a part of who we are, it shapes our experiences and our perspectives. To say that it doesn't matter is to ignore a huge part of what makes us human. And then there's the idea that we have to filter out any girl who indulges too much in any of her biological drives. I mean, seriously? Do you realize how ridiculous this alone is? We're all human beings, we all have desires and needs. To try to suppress those things in someone else is just cruel and unrealistic. And don't even get me started on the idea that a girl having short hair is a red flag. That's just absurd. Short hair can be incredibly feminine and beautiful. And a person's hair style has very little to do with their personality or their worth as a partner. But perhaps the most baffling thing I've seen on TRP lately is the idea that reading non-fiction makes you smarter than reading fiction. I mean, really? That's just ridiculous. Reading in general is a good thing, but to say that one type of reading is inherently better than another is just silly. In fact, I would argue that good fiction is usually smarter than non-fiction. Fiction allows us to explore complex ideas and emotions in a way that non-fiction simply can't. It allows us to see the world through someone else's eyes, to experience things we might never experience in our own lives. And let's not forget that many great scientists and thinkers have recommended fiction as an important part of their reading diet. Neil deGrasse Tyson, Richard Dawkins, and Albert Einstein have all included fiction on their favorite book lists. And for good reason. Reading fiction isn't a waste of time. It's an important part of being human, of exploring the world and ourselves. And to say that non-fiction is inherently better or smarter is just close-minded and ignorant. But perhaps the most troubling thing I've seen on TRP lately is the way some people talk about women. The idea that a girl not being "girly" is a huge red flag is just ridiculous. Women are individuals, just like men. They don't have to fit into some narrow stereotype of what it means to be feminine in order to be a great partner. And the idea that having a lot of male "friends" is a red flag because men and women can never truly be just friends is just absurd. Of course men and women can be friends. To suggest otherwise is to ignore the complexity and nuance of human relationships. In the end, I think the problem with TRP is that it's based on a fundamentally flawed premise. The idea that men and women are fundamentally different, that one gender is inherently superior to the other, is just wrong. We're all human beings, with our own strengths and weaknesses, our own desires and needs. And the idea that we can somehow control or manipulate the opposite sex is just delusional. We can't control other people, we can only control ourselves. And the best way to attract a great partner is to be a great person yourself. So let's stop trying to fit people into narrow stereotypes or control them through manipulation. Let's embrace our differences and our complexities, and let's focus on being the best versions of ourselves that we can be. That's the only way to truly find happiness and fulfillment in life.
