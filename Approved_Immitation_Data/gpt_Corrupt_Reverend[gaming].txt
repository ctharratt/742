Yo, what's up guys? It's your boy here, and today we're gonna talk about making money and buying cars in GTA V. Now, some people might say it's hard to make money in the game, but honestly, it's not that hard. You just gotta know what you're doing. Personally, I like having to work toward getting stuff in the game. It would be kind of boring if you could just steal everything you wanted. I mean, sure, you can steal any car that's not owned by a player, but you can't store the good ones unless you buy them. And let's be real, who doesn't want to own a sweet ride in the game? Now, let's talk about heists. Heists are a great way to make money in the game, and if you have an armored karuma, like 90% of the heists are a cakewalk. Seriously, if you're having a hard time with a heist, just check YouTube for the specific heist. People have figured out the optimal everything for the heists. Let's break it down by heist. For the Fleeca Job, you don't really need a karuma for the setups, but it's provided for the finale. For the Prison Break, you can use the karuma to steal the plane and the bus, and it can be used to take out a lot of the baddies before boarding the ship. For the Humane Raid, you can use the karuma to steal the insurgents, the heli, and the vans and technical. For the Series A Funding, you can use the karuma to clear out all the tweakers on the farm and escort the tanker. And for the Pacific Standard, you can use the karuma to steal the insurgent and truck, and you can even use it instead of the bikes for the finale. Now, I know some of you might be thinking, "But, what about the missions where you can't use the karuma?" Well, for the most part, those missions are some derivative of sneaky-snipey easiness. And if you take it slow and concentrate on one enemy at a time, most of the missions are simple. If you try to rush, you end up surrounded and dead. But let's be real, the swimming in this game is the most clunky feature. I hate it so much. And some people really suck at not dying on a motorcycle. But for the most part, the missions are easy if you just take it slow and use the right tools. Now, let's talk about some specific missions. For the Series A #1 mission, the chopper passenger clears the upper deck while the boat team clears the engine bay. By the time the boat team is done below, the deck is clear and you can access the cabins which are easy to just clear room by room. After you grab all the coke, you can either all get in the chopper, or you can steal the seasharks and go back to the karuma to make a getaway/ditch the cops. For the Series A #2 mission, the trash trucks, okay, this mission sucks legit. But it can be done fairly easy if you communicate and the driver knows to back up to the garbage bins. And for the Series A #5 mission, you can use the motherfucking karumas to clear out all the tweakers on the farm, then escort the tanker. For the Pacific Standard #2 mission, you can park the karuma next to a group of seasharks that are closest to the island. Do the whole island thing, then go straight to the waiting karuma after getting the weird squirrel guy. And for the Pacific Standard #3 mission, you can use the karuma to steal the hacking rig. Three players can go straight to the alley to clean it out while the 4th goes to pick up the van. Getaway isn't bad if you just go balls-out and don't slow down to try to kill the baddies. Now, I know I've been talking a lot about the karuma, but honestly, it's just a great tool to have in the game. And if you're having a hard time with a mission, just try using it. It might make all the difference. But let's not forget about the importance of making money in the game. There are a lot of ways to make money, but some of the easiest ways are doing heists, selling cars, and doing missions. And if you're really serious about making money, you can even invest in the stock market in the game. But let's be real, making money in the game is not that hard. And once you have the money, you can buy all the sweet rides you want. And let's not forget about the importance of having a good crew to play with. Having a good crew can make all the difference in the game. So, in conclusion, making money and buying cars in GTA V is not that hard. And if you're having a hard time with a mission, just try using the karuma. It might make all the difference. And let's not forget about the importance of having a good crew to play with. So, get out there, make some money, and buy some sweet rides. Peace out, guys.
