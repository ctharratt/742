Alright, let's talk about something that's been on my mind lately. It's a topic that's been bothering me for a while now, and I just need to get it off my chest. And that topic is... patience. Where do people get that kind of patience to sit and do that kind of work? I mean, seriously, I would end up getting about 2 hours into it and be like, "FUCK IT, I QUIT!" and be stuck with the massive tree and my wife bitching at me because "it's taking up too much room and you never finish anything!" But seriously, where does that kind of patience come from? Is it something you're born with, or is it something you develop over time? I mean, I've tried to be patient before, but it just never seems to work out for me. I always end up getting frustrated and giving up. And it's not just with big projects like that. It's with everything. I mean, even something as simple as waiting in line at the grocery store can drive me insane. I just don't have the patience for it. But then I see people who can sit and do something for hours on end, and I just don't understand it. I mean, I get bored after like 5 minutes. How do they do it? And it's not just with work either. It's with relationships too. I mean, how do people have the patience to deal with all the bullshit that comes with being in a relationship? I mean, I love my wife and all, but sometimes she can be a real pain in the ass. And I just don't have the patience to deal with it. But then I see other couples who have been together for years, and they just seem so happy and content with each other. And I wonder, how do they do it? How do they have the patience to deal with all the ups and downs of a relationship? I guess what I'm trying to say is that I envy people who have patience. I wish I had it too. But I just don't know how to get it. I mean, is it something you can learn, or is it just something you're born with? And I know some people will say that patience is a virtue, and that it's something you should strive for. But I just don't know if I have it in me. I mean, I'll try to be patient, but it just never seems to work out. So I guess I'll just have to live with my lack of patience. It's not the end of the world, I suppose. But sometimes it feels like it is. Anyway, that's my rant about patience. I hope you enjoyed it. And if you have any tips on how to be more patient, please let me know. I could use all the help I can get.
