As an experienced app developer with a paid app on the Play Store, I have some insights to share on various Android-related topics. From app development to security concerns, I have seen it all. In this article, I will address some common questions and concerns that Android users may have. Firstly, let's talk about app development. Google has changed its guidelines regarding the tinting of the navigation bar with material design. Initially, it was suggested that apps should tint the navigation bar, but now it is recommended not to do so. As a result, you may not see many apps doing it anymore. Moving on to rooting, it is important to note that there is a lot more to newer Android versions than just rooting. Depending on your phone, you may be able to find and flash a custom ROM that is Android 4.4 or newer, but this comes with a certain level of risk. Therefore, it is not recommended for everyone. When it comes to antivirus apps, they are generally useless when browsing via a mobile browser. However, if you download from less reputable sources, then an antivirus app could be useful for one major feature, which is a known blacklist of apps that contain malware. Since apps all run in their own sandbox, they cannot heavily influence other apps. Therefore, even apps like an antivirus app cannot actually do much. Most of the antivirus apps on the Play Store add a bunch of other random features that some may consider bloat, but others may find useful. Due to the sandbox nature of apps, the major Android vulnerabilities that come up cannot be stopped by an antivirus app (or any other app). Google recently started a monthly security update procedure for Android. It still remains to be seen how well manufacturers and then carriers implement it. For now, Nexus devices are in the best shape. The short answer is no, antivirus apps cannot stop major vulnerabilities. However, note that all that I am saying here assumes you are not rooted. The longer answer is that it depends on a few cases. If you only download and install apps from the Play Store, you should be good. Now, let's talk about SMS messages. Since the phone is off, it doesn't matter what model phone you have. Instead, it is carrier-specific as to how long they keep the message and attempt to deliver it. I can't find the exact amount of time all carriers keep them, but I am finding hints online to roughly 5 days for Verizon. Also, SMS in general is considered "Best Effort" and contains no guarantee that the recipient will actually get the message. Regarding the APN settings screen, if you are using a Verizon or Sprint version of the phone, it could be an issue with hiding the APN settings screen on some phones. I haven't seen much specific to the S4 though. Moving on to the Play Store, I haven't tried with a foreign account, but in general, on the Play Store, you have to use the same account. I have several accounts, and apps update under the one they were first downloaded with. This makes it very annoying to retire an old account. Regarding beta versions of apps, they can do weird things sometimes. I think it's a bug. It was broken for me a couple of weeks ago. I thought it was a side effect of being in the beta. I didn't realize it was broken in their production version as well. I am on 5.6.22.19 now, and it works like before. Unfortunately, Google does not let you change the primary account on the device. It's whatever is considered the primary account on the device. It's a bit annoying, but you can remove the other account and then add it again. Removing an account will make your next added Google account the primary one. Regarding permissions, all apps targeting Android 6 get an auto-granted list of permissions. Note that they still have to ask for them in the manifest so you can see what they use. Here is the list of "dangerous" permissions that have to be asked for at runtime. I believe that Read_Phone_State under the Phone category covers much of the identity information. For legacy apps, you can deny this permission. Some apps may crash or not function properly, but Android tries to feed blank/fake information to prevent that. When it comes to background apps, there are a lot of factors in play with how Android kills them. Also, apps can use tricks to restart themselves if killed, so they just seem to stay running. Things like setting to higher priority, having an always visible notification, and using less RAM can all help. Much of the background task closing centers around freeing up RAM. If you do something else very demanding in the foreground, then background apps that use a lot of RAM will likely be killed first. Google has kept Google Now fairly locked down, so other launchers can't get the access to do this. It's been asked for ever since Google released the feature. There have been some attempts to try and mimic it, but nothing comes anywhere close. Regarding Hangouts messages, Google shut down their open API, so only their apps have access to send Hangouts messages now. You are unlikely to get much of an answer to this here as this subject is more developer-focused. Finally, let's talk about Chinese Android phones. From what I could tell, the main issues are that they skimp on parts that are less visible to a spec sheet. Things like the screen quality and touch responsiveness tend to be much poorer. The overall build quality in general feels quite low compared to the higher-tier phones. However, for a budget, some are certainly usable, but don't expect flagship quality. This is all a generalization as there are some Chinese brands that have begun building high-end phones, but their prices have gone up as well. There may be other exceptions as well as I have certainly not tried them all. In conclusion, as an experienced app developer, I have seen many Android-related issues and concerns. From app development to security concerns, there are many things to consider when using an Android device. However, with the right knowledge and precautions, you can enjoy a safe and seamless Android experience.
