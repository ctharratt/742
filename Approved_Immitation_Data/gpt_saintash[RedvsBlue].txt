So, I finally got my hands on the Red vs Blue: The Ultimate Fan Guide, and I have to say, I have some mixed feelings about it. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of great content in there, but I feel like a lot of it is stuff that fans of the show would already know. Let's start with the good stuff. I absolutely loved the behind-the-scenes section at the end of the book. It was really interesting to read about how the show is made, and I especially enjoyed the interviews with the voice actors. It was cool to get some insight into what it's like to work on the show, and to hear some funny stories from the recording booth. I also really enjoyed the sections on the robot laws, O'Malley's evil plans, and Donut's diary. Those were all really fun to read, and they added some great depth to the show's lore. I also loved the section on Wash's recruitment, and the meeting between Leonard and Allison. Those were both really well-written and added some great backstory to the show. However, there were some things about the book that I didn't love. For one thing, I thought the layout was a bit weird. The book is longer than it is tall, which makes it stick out weirdly on my bookshelf. I also didn't understand why there were 30 pages dedicated to location information. I mean, I get that it's cool to know where all the different locations in the show are, but did we really need 30 pages of it? Another thing that bothered me was the timeline. It just doesn't make sense to me. According to the book, all of the freelancer backstory stuff in seasons 9 and 10 took place over years, but Blood Gulch only took place over a year and a half? And season 10 took a whole year? That just doesn't add up to me. It's not a huge deal, but it's something that bothered me. I also didn't love the fact that there were so many blank pages in the character profiles. I get that they wanted to make the book look nice, but it just seems like a waste of space to me. They could have used those pages for more information about the characters, or for some cool drawings or something. And finally, I have to say that I was really disappointed that there was no profile for Junior. I know that not everyone loves that character as much as I do, but come on, he's a fan favorite! I really wanted to know if his name is Blarggity Blarg-Tucker or Lavernius Tucker Junior. I mean, Junior works for both, but I really wanted to know for sure. Overall, I think the Red vs Blue: The Ultimate Fan Guide is a decent book. There's a lot of great content in there, and it's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of the show. However, I do think that a lot of the information in the book is stuff that fans would already know. If you're a die-hard fan who has watched the show multiple times, you might not find a lot of new information in the book. That being said, I do think that the behind-the-scenes section at the end of the book is really great, and it's definitely worth reading. It's cool to get some insight into how the show is made, and to hear from the voice actors about their experiences working on the show. All in all, I would say that the Red vs Blue: The Ultimate Fan Guide is a decent book, but it's not essential reading for fans of the show. If you're a casual fan who just wants to know a little bit more about the show, it's definitely worth checking out. But if you're a die-hard fan who already knows everything there is to know about Red vs Blue, you might not find a lot of new information in the book.
