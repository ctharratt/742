It's a tale as old as time: the evil boss. We've all had one, or at least heard horror stories from friends and family. They're the ones who make our lives miserable, who don't appreciate our hard work, who belittle us and make us feel small. They're the reason we dread going to work every day, the reason we come home exhausted and defeated. But here's the uncomfortable truth we don't want to talk about: we choose them. Yes, you read that right. We choose our evil bosses. In any situation where we end up working under someone we don't respect, somehow or other we put ourselves in that situation. The longer we stay in the job, the more we own it. We can say "I hate my job" and even "I hate my boss!" but at a certain point we have to take responsibility for our situation, too. Now, before you start getting defensive, let me clarify something. Responsibility is not the same as blame or shame. When you are beaten down and discouraged, the last thing you want to hear is "It sounds like you're in an awful situation at work, but then again, you chose it!" Those might be the most painful words you could possibly hear. "I chose it?!" you'll say, aghast and indignant. "I didn't choose this situation. I hate it. If I could change it, I would!" I don't blame you for feeling unequal to the challenge of changing your work situation. Everybody feels that way at times. Sometimes it feels comforting to believe we don't have a choice - that we are victims of circumstance, not to mention a victim of the evil boss. Being a victim means we are not responsible for the awful things we experience at the hands of our horrible manager. But here's the thing: being a victim also means we are powerless. It means we have no agency, no control over our own lives. And that's a terrible way to live. So how do we break free from the cycle of victimhood and take responsibility for our own happiness at work? The first step is to recognize that we do have a choice. We may not be able to control everything that happens to us, but we can control how we respond to it. We can choose to stay in a job we hate, or we can choose to start looking for something better. We can choose to let our evil boss make us feel small, or we can choose to stand up for ourselves and speak our truth. The second step is to take action. If you're unhappy at work, don't just sit there and complain about it. Do something about it. Start looking for a new job. Talk to your boss about your concerns. Take a class or learn a new skill that will make you more marketable. The more you take action, the more empowered you will feel. The third step is to change your mindset. Instead of seeing your evil boss as a monster who is out to get you, try to see them as a flawed human being who is struggling just like you are. Maybe they're dealing with personal issues that are making them act out at work. Maybe they're under a lot of pressure from their own boss. Maybe they're just not very good at managing people. Whatever the case may be, try to have compassion for them. It's not easy, but it's worth it. The fourth step is to focus on the positive. Even if you're in a job you hate with a boss you can't stand, there are still things to be grateful for. Maybe you have great coworkers. Maybe you're learning new skills. Maybe you're making a difference in the world. Whatever it is, focus on the good things and try to let go of the bad. The fifth and final step is to remember that you are in control of your own life. You may not be able to control everything that happens to you, but you can control how you respond to it. You can choose to be a victim, or you can choose to be a hero. You can choose to let your evil boss make you miserable, or you can choose to rise above it and find happiness elsewhere. In the end, the choice is yours. You can continue to be a victim of circumstance, or you can take responsibility for your own happiness at work. It's not easy, but it's worth it. So the next time you find yourself complaining about your evil boss, remember: you chose them. And you can choose to let them make you miserable, or you can choose to take control of your own life and find happiness elsewhere. The choice is yours.
