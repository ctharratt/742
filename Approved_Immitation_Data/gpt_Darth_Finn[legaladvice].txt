Oh boy, where do I even start? Let's talk about ego, shall we? It's like some people just can't handle the fact that they might not be the center of the universe. And don't even get me started on judges who think they can just impose ridiculous probation terms on people. It's like they want to throw the book at them if they can't keep up with impossible rules. My uncle, who works as a defense attorney, has seen it all. Sometimes he even advises his clients to take short jail sentences just to avoid the probation nightmare. But you know what really grinds my gears? People who think they know everything and try to force their negative worldview on others. It's like they're not happy unless everyone else is as miserable as they are. And don't even get me started on censorship. It's like some people think they have the right to control what others can and can't say or do. It's ridiculous. And speaking of ridiculous, have you seen some of the comments on Reddit lately? It's like people have forgotten how to be civil to each other. I mean, sure, we all make mistakes, but that doesn't give anyone the right to be a complete and utter asshole about it. And don't even get me started on the anti-vaxxers. It's like they think they know more than actual doctors and scientists. It's insane. But let's talk about something a little more lighthearted, shall we? Like video games. I mean, who doesn't love a good game? But there's been a lot of controversy lately, especially with this whole Gamergate thing. Some people think that video game journalism is biased and that there's a clique of indie developers that the journalists are all friends with. And then there are the paid-for reviews of AAA games and the seeming disdain for their readers. It's like they don't even care about the people who actually play the games. And then there's Anita Sarkeesian. Some people think she's the next person attacking video games as bad for society, just like parents groups in the 80s and 90s, and Jack Thompson (who referred to video games as murder simulators). But others think she's just trying to make gaming more inclusive. I mean, sure, more games like Portal need to be made, but that doesn't mean less games like Grand Theft Auto need to be made. It's all about balance, people. But you know what really grinds my gears? People who think they can just impose their views on others. Like that ex-boyfriend who started this whole Gamergate thing. It's like he thinks he has the right to air his dirty laundry in public and drag other people down with him. And don't even get me started on domestic violence cases where the victim doesn't want to prosecute and the state continues on without them. It's like they don't even care about the victim's wishes. But let's talk about something a little more positive, shall we? Like indie game developers. I mean, who doesn't love a good indie game? But there are some people who don't think they're "real" games. It's like they think that only big studios can make good games. But that's just not true. Some of the best games out there are made by indie developers. And speaking of indie developers, have you heard of Depression Quest? It's this really interesting game that's made to look like a choose your own adventure type story, but the more favorable choices are crossed out, leaving you only with something a depressed person would do. It's a really unique idea, but unfortunately, a lot of idiots are obsessed with it "not being a real game". They just don't get it. But you know what really grinds my gears? People who think they know everything and refuse to listen to other people's opinions. It's like they think they're the only ones who are right. But the truth is, there's always more than one side to a story. And just because someone disagrees with you doesn't mean they're wrong. So let's all try to be a little more open-minded, shall we? Let's listen to other people's opinions and try to understand where they're coming from. Because at the end of the day, we're all just trying to make sense of this crazy world we live in.
