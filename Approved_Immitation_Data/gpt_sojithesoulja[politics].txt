It's no secret that the fast food industry has a reputation for exploiting their workers. From low wages to long hours, it's a tough industry to work in. But Papa John's takes it to a whole new level. As someone who used to work there, I can attest to the fact that they stretch their labor out to an extreme degree. I remember working 8-hour shifts with no breaks, being forced to stay late constantly, and even having to do the work of other employees who didn't show up. And don't even get me started on the pay for drivers. Compared to other chain places like Dominos, Papa John's pays a flat fee every time you leave the store instead of paying per mile. This means that if you take multiple deliveries in one run, you get shafted compared to working at Dominos. But it's not just the pay that's the issue. Papa John's expects their drivers to quickly make a pizza or two between runs, which isn't a big deal in and of itself. But if they didn't stretch their labor out so much, they would have an instore worker to do that as well. Instead, they rely on their drivers to do the work of multiple people. And let's not forget about the half-hearted "thanks, I appreciate you" that managers are ingrained to say constantly. It's annoying and insincere, and it's just another way for Papa John's to try and make their workers feel valued without actually doing anything to improve their working conditions. But the real issue here is the greed of Papa John's CEO, John Schnatter. He's using the pandemic as an excuse to stretch out his labor even more, and it's not just unfair to his workers - it's dangerous. If employees are overworked and exhausted, they're more likely to make mistakes that could cause harm to themselves or others. It's time for us to take a stand against this kind of exploitation. We need to start battletoading Papa John's and boycotting their restaurants until they start treating their workers with the respect and dignity they deserve. And it's not just Papa John's - we need to hold all fast food chains accountable for their treatment of workers. But it's not just the fast food industry that's guilty of exploiting workers. The entire capitalist system is built on the exploitation of labor. Workers are paid as little as possible while CEOs and shareholders make millions. It's time for us to demand a fairer system that values workers and ensures that everyone has access to a decent standard of living. And speaking of unfair systems, let's talk about the recent election. It's clear that there was some corruption and vote tampering going on, especially in states like Ohio. But even if there wasn't, the fact remains that the Republican party is stuck in a vacuum-sealed, door-locked spin cycle of denying the factual, lived truth of the world. They refuse to accept that climate change is real, that rape can cause pregnancy, and that evolution is a thing. They cling to the idea that cutting taxes on the rich will magically grow the economy, despite all evidence to the contrary. And they continue to push the idea that moderate reforms of the regulations on the insurance industry and the financial services industry are the same thing as communism. It's time for them to wake up and start accepting the real problems facing our country. We need constructive debate between competing, feasible ideas about real problems. And if the Republican party is forced to do that by the humiliation they were dealt in the recent election, then we will all be better off as a nation. But it's not just the Republicans who need to wake up. We all need to start paying attention to the real problems facing our country. We need to start demanding a fairer system that values workers and ensures that everyone has access to a decent standard of living. We need to start taking action against the exploitation of labor in all industries, not just fast food. It's time for us to come together and demand a better future for ourselves and for future generations. We can't afford to sit back and let the powers that be continue to exploit us for their own gain. We need to take action and demand change.
