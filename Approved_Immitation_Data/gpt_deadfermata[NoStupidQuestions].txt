Well, let me tell you, there are a lot of things that can happen after death. I mean, sure, your body stops functioning and all that, but there are some interesting things that can occur. For one, all your excrements will come out. Yeah, I know, not the most pleasant thing to think about, but it's true. Every muscle in your body stops receiving energy in the form of ATP, so your bowels will relax and a bowel movement can occur. And get this, post-mortem erections are also a real thing! Who knew, right? But let's move on to something a bit less morbid, like art. Art is such a subjective thing, don't you think? I mean, the value of art is really what people who have money give to it. If millionaires bought Bob Ross' paintings at 6-7 figures, then the art world would say his art is worth a lot. It really is what someone says it is worth. Van Gogh's art is great, but in his day, it wasn't anything 'special' whereas nowadays you can get several organs and surgeries for one piece of his art. In the same vein, there may be artists out there whose art is amazing but who haven't been given some value yet. If I was a millionaire and started snagging up art by an unknown artist for a large sum, suddenly people would be seeking out other work by the artist and trying to value it very high, and it sort of snowballs from there. Speaking of snowballs, have you ever tried to watch a video in full screen and it just doesn't work? It's like, come on, technology, get it together! But sometimes it's not the technology's fault, it's the person posting the video. If they posted a gif instead of the GIFV link, it can explain why it loads more slowly and why you can't right click to show controls. And don't even get me started on trying to control GIFs. You can only control GIFV, which is a whole different ballgame. But let's switch gears again and talk about shoes. Did you know that the pressure of a shoe will unlikely kill bacteria? I mean, there are a lot of 'weak' points at the airport, but shoes aren't one of them. Same idea with a terrorist who could drive a car bomb into the airport and detonate the bomb without needing to even go into the airport. There are many easy and soft targets, unfortunately. And while we're on the topic of airports, have you ever noticed all the unmarked cop cars? It's like they're trying to be sneaky or something. But then again, the system has both marked and unmarked cop cars. Same thing with seeing cops in uniform and those 'undercover' who blend in. It's all about strategy, my friends. But let's get back to the topic of shoes for a second. If you have a pair of sunglass frames you like, you can bring it to your optometrist and they can get it fit for prescription shaded lens. Please note that they will not take responsibility if the frame breaks or gets damaged. But hey, it's worth a shot, right? And speaking of shots, have you ever wondered if North Korea will ever get a different economic system? I mean, they can't seem to get that darn economic system to enter that country. Maybe they just like things the way they are, who knows? But let's move on to something a bit more serious, like the Bible. Maybe Jesus did appear before many after his resurrection and maybe his ascension was also witnessed by a multitude. However, this is the only historical account. There are no other sources of this aside from the Bible. But then again, anything is possible, right? Curiouser and curiouser. And while we're on the topic of religion, have you ever wondered if whales evolved from land animal ancestors? Well, wonder no more, my friends. They did not. It's just one of those things that people like to speculate about, but the truth is, whales have always been whales. But let's switch gears again and talk about politics. If an independent candidate runs, they could take votes away from the GOP nominee and the Republican will lose the presidency. Except in North Korea, of course. But let's not get too political here, folks. And while we're on the topic of politics, have you ever noticed how the police in urban areas tend to respond faster and pursue justice harder? In other parts of the world, it seems cops can be paid off more easily or don't have as strong an infrastructure to deal or pursue criminals. It's just one of those things that makes you appreciate living in a place with a strong justice system. But let's switch gears one more time and talk about airplanes. Did you know that commercial airplanes do not have keys except for the cockpit door? Nor is there some code to start the plane. In theory, if you have access to the flight deck, you can steal and fly the plane, but the odds of that happening with security measures, locked cockpit doors, starting it up, getting pushed back on the ground, clearance, is close to impossible. Some smaller planes have keys, but not like ignition keys of a car. And speaking of airplanes, have you ever had a connecting flight that got pushed back a couple of hours? It's frustrating, right? I mean, sure, if there are mechanical issues or weather, it's understandable, but when they pushed it back a month ago, that's just ridiculous. But let's end on a positive note, shall we? If you're ever feeling down, just remember that you can always add the word 'gif' in front of a YouTube link to make it a GIFV link. It's a quick trick that doesn't require any copy-pasting. And who doesn't love a good GIF, am I right?
