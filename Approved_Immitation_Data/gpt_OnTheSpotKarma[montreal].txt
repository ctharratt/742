I recently stumbled upon an interesting fact about banks that I thought I should share with everyone. Did you know that all clients have a hidden overdraft depending on their standing and relationship with the bank? This means that even if you asked for no overdraft, you might have one. And if by any mistake you make a purchase and you don't have the funds, it'll go through as a courtesy and they'll charge you for a courtesy overdraft fee. Sneaky, right? I know this because I used to work at RBC, and let me tell you, it was an eye-opening experience. I worked in customer service, which meant I had to deal with a lot of angry customers on a daily basis. Most of them were stupidly rich old people who treated me like shit and asked me to pay their bills. It was a thankless job, to say the least. But the one thing that made it interesting was that I literally saw everything about the clients that called in. Their net worth, debt ratio, account balances, transactions, credit cards, loans, where they work, etc. It gave me a pretty good idea of what to do in life to really get money. And what I learned is that most people out there rely a lot on credit to live. I feel liberated for not using credit at all - except for student loans. It's funny how working for a bank can make you feel guilty about working for a bank. Whenever they made meetings about bank raising fees or whatever, no reasons were given to us, and we had to deal with customers complaining. It was hard to deal with my conscience sometimes. But the pay wasn't that good for the amount of calls we had to take. We had to take 80-110 calls a day, where Bell was more around 30-50 calls a day. And the only truly rich people I saw were business owners. So if you want to get rich, start a business. Speaking of money, did you know that all clients have a hidden overdraft depending on their standing and relationship with the bank? I can't stress this enough. Even if you asked for no overdraft, you might have one. And if by any mistake you make a purchase and you don't have the funds, it'll go through as a courtesy and they'll charge you for a courtesy overdraft fee. It's a sneaky way for banks to make money off of you. But enough about banks. Let's talk about something more interesting, like my birthday. The 10th is the greatest day to be in Montreal because it's my birthday. I used to love it, but then I broke my femur and my patella 8 years ago. It took 6 months to recover, but I always had this little difference in one leg when walking. Today, the way I walk is fucked, my back always hurts, and nobody can fix it. I'm only 22, but I feel like an old man sometimes. Thinking about winter gets me depressed. Fuck winter. It's cold, it's dark, and it's depressing. But there are some things you can do to make it more bearable. For example, you can listen to Enter The Void by Gaspar No√©. It's a trippy movie that will take you on a journey through the tunnels and bridges of your mind. Just watch out for the tunnels and bridges in real life. And speaking of trippy things, did you know that TekSavvy is great? That dwarf in the machine has to get paid somehow! I know this sounds like I'm trolling, but I'm not. TekSavvy is a great internet provider that offers affordable and reliable service. And no, I'm not getting paid to say this. In conclusion, working at a bank can be a soul-sucking experience, but it can also be eye-opening. You get to see how the other half lives, and you realize that most people out there rely a lot on credit to live. But if you want to get rich, start a business. And always remember that all clients have a hidden overdraft depending on their standing and relationship with the bank. Don't let them sneak up on you.
