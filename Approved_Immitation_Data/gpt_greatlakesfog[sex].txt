I have to admit, I was a bit hesitant to write about this topic at first. But after reading through the comments and seeing how open and honest everyone is being, I feel like I can share my own experiences and thoughts without fear of judgment. First off, I want to say that I completely agree with the importance of having open and honest conversations about sex and sexuality with our partners and children. Growing up in a conservative household where sex was never discussed, I had to learn about it on my own through trial and error. And while I don't regret my experiences, I do wish that I had someone to talk to and guide me through it all. That being said, I think it's important to approach these conversations with sensitivity and respect. Everyone has their own boundaries and comfort levels, and it's important to acknowledge and respect those. For example, while I may be comfortable discussing certain kinks or sexual preferences with my partner, someone else may not be. And that's okay. I also think it's important to acknowledge the role that porn plays in our society and in our own sexual experiences. As someone who has watched porn in the past, I can say that it can be both helpful and harmful. On one hand, it can be a way to explore and learn about different sexual acts and preferences. On the other hand, it can also perpetuate harmful stereotypes and unrealistic expectations. I think it's important to have conversations about the different types of porn out there, and to acknowledge that not all of it is healthy or consensual. As someone who has stumbled upon violent or non-consensual porn in the past, I can say that it can be incredibly damaging and traumatic. And while I don't think that we should necessarily ban porn altogether, I do think that we need to be more mindful of the messages that it sends and the impact that it can have on our own sexual experiences. Moving on to the topic of birth control, I have to say that I am a huge advocate for non-hormonal options like the ParaGuard. While I understand that hormonal birth control can be helpful for some people, I personally have had negative experiences with it in the past. And after doing my own research and talking to my doctor, I feel confident in my decision to use a non-hormonal option. That being said, I do think that it's important to acknowledge that everyone's experiences with birth control will be different. What works for one person may not work for another. And while it's important to share our own experiences and opinions, we should also be respectful of other people's choices and decisions. Finally, I want to touch on the topic of sexual compatibility. As someone who has been in a long-term relationship, I can say that it's not always easy to navigate. While my partner and I have had many conversations about our sexual preferences and desires, there are still times when we don't see eye-to-eye. And while it can be frustrating at times, I think it's important to remember that sexual compatibility is not the only factor in a healthy relationship. At the end of the day, I think that open and honest communication is key in all aspects of our lives, including our sex lives. Whether we're talking to our partners, our children, or our friends, we need to be willing to listen and learn from each other. And while it may not always be easy, I truly believe that it's worth it in the end.
