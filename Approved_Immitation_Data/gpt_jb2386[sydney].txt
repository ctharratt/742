So, have you ever heard of the different types of swallows? I mean, I was just as surprised as you when I found out. Apparently, there are over 80 different species of swallows, each with their own unique characteristics and behaviors. Who knew, right? But let's move on to something else. Have you ever been on a flight and noticed the same flight path as before, but with slightly better conditions? I mean, it's not like you can control the weather or anything, but it's always nice to have a smoother ride. And speaking of flights, have you ever had a layover that was just too short to make it over the mountains? Two hours just isn't enough time sometimes. But let's talk about something more exciting, like the recent developments in transportation in our city. The M4 to the city and the M2 to the F3 are both badly needed, and it's great to see that the government is finally taking action. As a Greens voter, I'm usually skeptical of the Liberal government's decisions, but they've made some good ones lately. The North West Rail Link, legalizing Uber, and the second airport decision are all steps in the right direction. But let's not forget about the controversy surrounding trams versus trains. Sure, trams may be in traffic for most of their route, but they're still a viable option for transportation. And if you're a fan of public figures, like Jimmy Carr, you might even consider waiting in line to meet them after a show. I mean, who wouldn't want to meet their favorite comedian? Speaking of Jimmy Carr, have you seen his latest show? It's hilarious, but be warned, he's not afraid to push the boundaries with his jokes. And if you're lucky enough to catch him on a night when he's asking for hecklers, you're in for a real treat. But let's not forget about the lady who spoiled the Star Wars movie for everyone in the audience. That's just not cool. And while we're on the topic of rude behavior, let's talk about the person who threw a bottle at Jimmy during his show. That's just a dick move, plain and simple. And it's not like the ushers weren't there to see it happen. They could have easily notified security or someone in charge. But let's not let one bad apple ruin the bunch. There are plenty of good people out there, regardless of their faith or beliefs. But speaking of beliefs, have you ever been judged for your political views? It's a touchy subject for some people, and it's best to steer clear of those conversations if you don't want to offend anyone. And while we're on the topic of offending people, let's talk about the woman who questioned someone's disability. That's just plain ignorant and rude. People have the right to use what's rightfully theirs, and no one should be made to feel bad about it. But let's move on to something more positive, like the expansion of a local shopping center. It's amazing how much it's grown and changed over the years. And let's not forget about the new apartments that are popping up everywhere. They all seem to have car spaces, which is great for those who need them. And finally, let's circle back to the topic of swallows. Who knew there were so many different types? It just goes to show that there's always something new to learn, even about the most mundane things. So, the next time you see a swallow, take a closer look. You might just be surprised at what you find.
