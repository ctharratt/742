Can you imagine if Jar Jar Binks made a comeback in Episode IX? "Meesa is back!" I can just picture it now. And what if Supreme Leader Snoke turned out to be Darth Jar Jar all along? "Yousa people are all gonna die!" or "It was meesa Luke, author of all yousa pain!" That would be the ultimate plot twist.  But let's talk about some other movies. I recently watched The Force Awakens and I have to say, that moment when Kylo Ren stopped and stared at Finn was really intimidating. Some people say there's no "visual storytelling" in it, but I have to disagree. It's a perfect example of visual storytelling. You could watch it as a silent film and still probably understand it. Compare that to something like Tarantino's movies that rely heavily on dialogue. Or to Nolan's movies where everything is explained.  Speaking of movies, I have often thought that it would be interesting to see a cut of Titanic where all the old Rose scenes are cut off and the whole movie takes place in 1912. I'm not sure if it would be better, but it would be interesting to see. Someone should do it.  And have you seen A Most Violent Year? Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain were both really great in it. I put it up there with movies like The Godfather. In my opinion, it's one of the most underrated movies of the 2010s.  But let's talk about Avatar. I feel like it's less intrinsically American than Star Wars. It's easier to market internationally. And speaking of James Cameron, if you bet against him, you're betting to lose.  Now, I know some people say that it's necessary to give out some spoilers to convince people to see a new movie. But just take a look at the trailer for The Shining. It doesn't tell anything about the plot, even less than the TFA trailers did. But if I saw a trailer like that about a new movie, I would surely be really intrigued to learn more about it. Much more than after seeing some typical trailer that shows the whole movie.  And let's talk about Spectre. Why was there DNA of many SPECTRE agents on that ring? Was there some SPECTRE orgy where they all laid their DNA on that ring? I doubt that shaking hands leaves DNA, especially in a quantity that can be found years after the handshake happened.  But let's talk about the movie industry as a whole. I just don't see how the current model could ever be financially sustainable on a large scale. Sure, Netflix or Amazon can buy some loss leader every now and then, but if all movies would do the same, where would the money come from? And speaking of Netflix, they aren't getting a $12 ticket price every time somebody watches a movie from them.  And finally, let's talk about Jennifer Lawrence. I'm not against her making millions. It's a free market and she deserves what they're paying her. But I think it's very distasteful to cry about your salary when you're making more money than 99.99% of people. And it's especially stupid how she's crying about not getting paid the same for the same work, because she's one of the best-paid people in her field. So if every leading actor would get paid the same for the same work, she would make drastically less.  In conclusion, there are a lot of things to talk about when it comes to movies and the movie industry. But one thing is for sure, Jar Jar Binks needs to make a comeback in Episode IX. "Meesa is back!"
