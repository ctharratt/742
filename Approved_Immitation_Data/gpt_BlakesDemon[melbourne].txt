Have you checked out the NGV lately? I mean, seriously, have you? It's like a whole new world in there. I went in the other day and was blown away by the art on display. It's like they've taken everything to the next level. I mean, I know art is subjective and all that, but you can't deny the talent on display here. But let's talk about something else for a minute. Have you ever had a job where you felt like you were the only one putting in any effort? It's frustrating, right? But then, when you finally get that recognition you deserve, it's like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders. And if you're lucky, you might even get a bonus from the government. How cool is that? Now, let's talk about indie disco. What even is that? Can someone give me an example? I just can't see how those genres mix. But then again, maybe I'm just getting old. I can't remember the last time I had a "new band" to follow. It's been at least three years. Am I out of touch? But let's talk about something more local. The good thing about La Trobe is that Traralgon is getting more and more industry coming in. It's expanding out to the other towns, and that's great news for everyone. And with the stigma of the place slowly fading away, it's becoming a great place for investors. Especially after that mine fire thing. That was a real wake-up call for the area. Speaking of wake-up calls, what counts as "plus-sized" these days? I mean, when I go shopping with my wife, I see sizes 14-18 all the time. Is it rude to think of those as plus-sized? I don't want to offend anyone, but I'm genuinely curious. Now, let's talk about real estate. My family made the mistake of buying an apartment when I was a kid. We should have gone for land. It won't boom for a few more years, but you can get some really decent homes in La Trobe Valley for around 300k. And when the boom hits (which I'm predicting will be in about 5-7 years), those homes will double in value overnight. Trust me on this one. But let's talk about something that's been bothering me lately. Shopping centres. They all look the same these days, don't they? You walk in and you can't even remember which store you're going to. Is this Central or Chadstone? And don't even get me started on City Basement. That place is a crime collection waiting to happen. And speaking of crime, what's with all the expulsions lately? I mean, I get sending kids home, but expulsion? That's a bit extreme, isn't it? And why punish the child? Shouldn't the parents be fined instead? A large majority of non-vaccinators can certainly afford a good fine. But let's talk about something more fun. Binge-watching Criminal Minds. Have you seen Xander from Buffy on there? He's basically playing the same character. It's like a crossover episode or something. Now, let's talk about something that's been on my mind for a while. How do you get your bond back if you don't have a contract? Is it even possible? And is it a good thing that you were missing those work relationships? I mean, they can be pretty awkward, right? But let's talk about something more serious. Why do companies keep adding new problems when they haven't even fixed the ones they already have? It's like they're just asking for trouble. And speaking of trouble, have you ever been to a really shitty nightclub? It doesn't matter where it is, it matters that you're getting out there and having a good time. But if you're having a shitty time, people can tell. So just make the most of it, okay? Now, let's talk about something that's been bugging me lately. Vague assessments. I mean, come on, give us something to work with here. And why do they always have to be due in 23 hours? That's just cruel. But let's talk about something more fun. Quizzes! I love quizzes, but I haven't picked up a paper in ages. RIP MX. And speaking of things that are dead, does anyone remember Diablo 2? That game was the bomb. Now, let's talk about something that's been on my mind for a while. Free all-day parking. How close can you get to the city and still find it? I mean, what's the closest train station that provides car parking? These are the important questions, people. But let's talk about something more exciting. Bikies! Have you ever sidled up to one at a bar and asked if they know anyone who can perform "a hit"? I mean, I wouldn't recommend it, but it would be pretty funny to watch. And speaking of funny, have you ever seen Arj Barker open for Flight of the Conchords? That guy is hilarious. I would rate him somewhere in the middle of the comics I've seen on stage. So there you have it, folks. My ramblings on a variety of topics. I hope you enjoyed them as much as I enjoyed writing them. Until next time, keep on keeping on.
