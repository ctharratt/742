Hey there, thanks for tuning in. I've been having some trouble with my wireless connection lately and I thought I'd share my experience with you all. It's been a frustrating journey, but I've learned a lot along the way. So, let me start from the beginning. I noticed that my laptop was dropping the wireless connection frequently, while my Android phone and Windows laptop were not. This was strange to me, as they were all connected to the same router and in close proximity to each other. I tried resetting both the modem and router, but the connection only dropped on my Linux box. All the other computers on the network were unaffected, which was really frustrating. I decided to run Wireshark for a couple of minutes when my connection was down to see what was going on. What I found was that the only thing getting through was ARP broadcasting - "Who has 192.168.1.1? Tell 192.168.1.155" was repeated a bunch of times. There were no other packets logged, even though I tried to access a couple of different webpages. This made me think that the problem was with my computer specifically, but I wasn't sure where to go from there. I did some research and found out that Wireshark is an amazing tool, but I wasn't sure how to use it correctly to diagnose this problem. I was hoping to find some new things to Google that might put me on the right track. I exhausted the wiki and was hoping for some fresh ideas. I also had to reinstall PAM and PAMBASE for some reason, and now I have to log in with su to get anything done because sudo refuses to work. It's not ideal, but it's what I have to do for now. I'm pretty broke and living in a temporary arrangement, so ideally I would buy a new router and forget the whole thing. But that's not an option right now, so I have to figure out what's going on with my wireless connection. I'm using a Broadcom card working on the brcmsmac driver. I've also tried broadcom-wl, but it's even less stable. Unfortunately, I think those are my only two choices. I've exhausted the wiki and was hoping for new things to Google that might put me on the right track. I'm not sure where to go to get a log of what my wireless card is doing so I can figure this out. I've tried iwconfig, but it says that I don't have power management enabled for wlan0, so that didn't help. If anyone has any suggestions, I'm all ears. I've been using Linux for a while now, and I've found that Debian can be a bit challenging when it comes to installing things that aren't completely open source, such as proprietary hardware drivers. Compared to Ubuntu/Mint, that's the real big difference. Any Linux distro will let you put on anything you want, as long as you're okay compiling it from source or (if it's Debian-based) downloading a .deb file and installing from that (easier). In my situation, I would go with Ubuntu or Mint, just because the kind of challenges you're going to get with a Debian install are things like getting hardware to work - nothing particularly fun to deal with. If you want to really learn about Linux, I'd install Ubuntu and insist on doing everything through the terminal, or install Arch - it combines a system you get to build yourself with a grade-A package manager. I've never worked with Gentoo/Slackware, but I understand there's a lot of compiling from source and while not particularly difficult, that takes a lot of time and nitpicking dependencies. As far as running stuff through Wine, you install Windows programs THROUGH Wine - the Debian package manager is going to have nothing to do with that. TL;DR: I suggest Arch if you want a bit of a challenge (but not too hard). Debian's challenges are just going to be getting your hardware to work with open-source drivers, after that it's the same as Ubuntu/Mint in my experience (the package manager is the same). Getting programs to work through Wine is going to be the big challenge, but that has nothing to do with what distro you're on. The Thinkpad is classic, but I've never had trouble getting various distros to work on any computer really. The kernel really supports a lot nowadays. I originally had trouble working with my Broadcom wireless card, but now that works on a base Arch install too, so I'd imagine it would work out of the box with Ubuntu. So really Linux is not the limiting factor here - pick what you want, there will most likely be a way to get it to work. If you're having trouble with your fstab, you can boot into a live CD/USB, fix your fstab, and then reboot into your old distro. From now on, whenever you make changes to fstab, run 'sudo mount -a' afterwards to see if your changes work, without rebooting the computer. If you're having trouble adding partitions to /etc/fstab, you can check out the man page for fstab. As far as accessing other hard drive partitions in the computer, you have to manually mount them. You can do this either by selecting them in the file manager or by going into a terminal and mounting them manually. First, run 'sudo fdisk -l' to list the available partitions. Figure out which one is the root partition (I'm guessing the biggest one, unless you have a separate partition for /home). Then, run 'mkdir /media/disk' to make a blank directory for the drive to mount to. Finally, run 'mount /dev/sdaX /media/disk' where 'sdaX' is the partition you want to mount. This mounts the partition at /media/disk. Now, cd into /media/disk and find that fstab! I hope this has been helpful for anyone else experiencing wireless connection issues. It's been a frustrating journey, but I've learned a lot along the way. Don't give up - there's always a solution out there!
