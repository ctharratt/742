Well, well, well. Looks like we have another one who thinks they know everything about the LDS church. Let me tell you, if you can't comment without doing a little research, then I don't know how you're the one who is brainwashed. You are correct, there are a lot of misconceptions and misinformation out there about the church. But let me set the record straight. First of all, let's talk about the mass resignation issue. It would take at least 150,000 people resigning to make a 1% loss. Those numbers aren't showing up (the largest mass resignation I've heard of was 3,000). And, when combined with the fact that the church baptizes around 300,000 new members each year, you would have to double that number just to break even. That's no hemorrhage. The church is still growing rather than shrinking. Now, let's talk about finances. I have zero student loans right now. Everything is covered by either university (church) scholarships or FAFSA grants. I met with my bishop and we talked about my family's financial status. He then authorized money from the church's missionary fund to go towards funding my mission. The church won't deny you the opportunity to serve a mission just because you can't contribute financially. And let's not forget about the home teachers. They visit everyone in the ward, active and inactive. I hardly think the church is "hemorrhaging" members. A couple thousand out of 15 million isn't a very large impact. Now, let's talk about the CES letter. Please, please, please don't leave a billion comments asking me if I've read it. I have. I've researched it. I've found the many faults in it and therefore have moved along and continued with my faith. The amount of misinformation on this page is ridiculous. And let's not forget about the accusations against Joseph Smith. The man who was behind the printing press destroyed was accused of sexual transgression and expelled from the church, and to cover it up he went around accusing Joseph of having committed "gross immoralities." But it was he himself who had a history with these things. No charges of pedophilia were ever filed against Joseph or Hyrum, nor were they among any of the reasons the mobs assembled. It was mostly political, with groups of locals believing that the large amount of Mormons settling in the area and their strong political involvement would lead to shifts in the political culture that they didn't support, including but not limited to a strong anti-slavery sentiment among the Mormons. And let's not forget about the FLDS. They are a radical branch of the LDS religion, just like there are radical offshoots of many religions and philosophies. They do not represent the beliefs or practices of the mainstream LDS church. Now, let's talk about the temple garments. It's a symbol of the covenant. Part of the covenant is to wear the garment, so I suppose in that way it's fulfilling the covenant which gives you the protection. And let's not forget about the ban on black people holding the priesthood. We've admitted that it probably had ties to racism. Nobody really knows why it was banned in the first place. So, there you have it. The truth about the LDS church. I'm sorry if it doesn't fit with your preconceived notions or if it challenges your beliefs. But that's the beauty of free agency. You can choose to believe what you want. As for me, I choose to believe in the teachings of the LDS church. I believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet. I believe that Thomas Monson is a prophet. And I believe that the church is true.
