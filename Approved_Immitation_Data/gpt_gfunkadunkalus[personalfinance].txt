Investing in real estate can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to predicting the future. It's hard to time anything, and that's what makes finance so infuriating. It's difficult to assume a new bubble and real estate crash or even a rise of interest rates depressing home prices. In a few years, if rates rise, people speculate home prices to drop. The question is if income also rises with inflation, would that negate the depression of prices? Even when interest rates were over 10% in the eighties, home prices increased. The increase is roughly 4-5% per year for the last 30 years (Case-Schiller Home Price data), which is why investors think real estate as a hedge against inflation. Regardless, the main point is it's difficult to tell the future, especially when it comes to economics. You have plenty of time to buy a house. Don't rush it and don't get emotional about it. It does sound like you found a place near or around Silver Lake (just guessing based on price and your username), but don't fall too much in love with the area. Things change and gentrify or decline in LA all the time, look at Venice Beach. Banks still like 20% down, and I would recommend this. Not dealing with PMI (premium mortgage insurance) is a godsend. You could have a down payment of 3% for an FHA loan since you're a first-time homebuyer, but it's risky with higher payments. If you are a Veteran (VA loan), it's a 1% down and no PMI, but payments are high. If you want more information on if you can afford a house, look up DTI (debt to income). Every bank, credit union, and financial institution has this and their own underwriting criteria, but what you find online will get you a baseline assessment. It calculates your income and expenses and what can be applied to the mortgage payments. This will tell you also whether you feel you can afford a house based on your income. Please do me this favor. Don't buy a house because your friends have it or it's time for you to own it, but because it makes sense to own. Logic plays a big role in it, but not rationality. We can rationalize anything. I tend to look at the total debt load of a person based on their credit report and what they report to me. So if I see two credit cards with $50 payments each and a mortgage of $1,500 per month, I see that their monthly expenditure is $1,600. The yearly debt service would be $19,200 ($1,600 per month * 12 months). I divide this by 45%. The income for the business owner ought to be $42,666.67. So this covers all debt they have for the year plus their lifestyle and other incidentals. It's not perfect, but it helps me analyze how much a business owner should be paying his/herself. In my assets category, I only have cash, securities, retirement, home, and cars. My liabilities are my mortgage, student loans, and credit card. So I look at my net worth monthly and then I look at different ratios. My debt to net worth ratio is comprised of net worth divided by liabilities. I strive to have a ratio of under 100% currently. Debt load is comprised of liabilities divided by assets. I look to be under 35%. Liquid assets divided by total debt, which I do monthly, and I strive to be over 10%. I take my cash and securities and divide by my total debt. It's all good, eat the elephant one bite at a time. I have a similar school debt after grad school. I did the 20-year plan extended to lower my payments that way if other expenses get in the way, you won't have to concentrate on that bill for that month and make the minimum, or if your loan has a low rate, then you can concentrate on building up your retirement or savings fund. Since my loans are at 6.8%, I'm doing the snowball method of paying it off (this you'll find archived in this thread). So my lowest "loan" is $4k. If I pay this off, I'll save $30 a month, but I'm going to use this $30 and extra cash to pay off the second-lowest bill. Just keep rolling it over to pay off more of the loan. As for reconciliation, I believe the gov changed the rules, and you may not be able to reconsolidate your loans unless they are private. Based on your picture, it's not a private loan. Thank you for your kindness. I wish you and your mother luck in this process. For what it's worth, and again, I'm experienced in commercial real estate and unsure if residential real estate has different laws in regards to foreclosure, is that the foreclosure process takes 9 months if the bank is efficient. Filing bankruptcy also will slow down the process. If your mother's house is less than what is owed to the bank, then a bankruptcy can force the bank to do a cram down to lower payments. I'm not sure if she would have to make prepetition and postpetition payments to get the cram down, but if you have a good lawyer, they can advise you on this and what she would need to do to force the cram down. I remember a debtor showed the judge the appraised value, and the judge ordered me and my financial institution to cram down the loan. It is a complicated process, but I hope it helps you and your mother. What she can do, if she knows she can't afford her house any longer and modifications are not being given, is a deed in lieu. The lawyer, a competent one, can draft language stating the house will be given up with no contest by her as long as the bank does not chase her for the guarantee. I'm not sure if it's feasible due to the fact that your stepfather may be on the loan and would need to sign off, too, if applicable.

If you are purchasing a single-family residence as a rental property, you wouldn't have to think about vacancy in your calculations since you're either 100% or 0%. With expenses, the question is what you will spend on repairs and maintenance, taxes, insurance, and other expenses. Subtract your income from your expenses to derive your net operating income (NOI) compare that to your debt financing, if any. If you have debt financing, then divide your NOI by the debt service to get a DCR (debt coverage ratio). Make sure your calculations are for the same time period, such as monthly NOI divided by monthly debt service or yearly NOI by yearly debt service. If you're over 1.0, then you can cover your debt, so you'd want something closer to 1.1 or 1.2 as your DCR. The other thing you should think about is having a replacement reserve for future capital expenditures. Does the roof need to be repaired in five years? Save enough for the roof and put that into your calculation to see if it's a wise investment. On a side note, I've seen some comments on here in regards to cap rates. Cap rate is derived from net operating income (NOI) / Sales price. The best way to think about a formula is to really think about what you can rent it out for, what expenses are, and your debt.
