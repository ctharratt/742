Watching Christopher Nolan's movies, it's hard not to notice the lack of establishing shots or point-making shots. The Dark Knight, in particular, has a lot of moments like this. It wasn't until my third re-watch that I realized the Joker burned Lao alive on the pile of money, and I'm still not sure if the Joker killed that older cop after the bomb went off. I'm not sure if it was deliberate or if Nolan is such a big picture guy that he forgets to shoot smaller moments like that. Compare this to a tighter director like David Fincher, who is known for his attention to detail and precision in every shot. Fincher's movies are meticulously crafted, with every shot serving a purpose and contributing to the overall story. You wouldn't catch Fincher missing a crucial moment like the ones in The Dark Knight. But perhaps Nolan's approach is intentional. He is known for his complex, multi-layered narratives that require the audience to pay close attention and connect the dots themselves. By leaving out certain shots or moments, Nolan is forcing the audience to engage with the story on a deeper level and piece together the puzzle themselves. However, this approach can also lead to confusion and frustration for some viewers. It's easy to miss important details or connections when they're not explicitly shown on screen. And while some may appreciate the challenge of piecing together the story, others may find it tedious or even off-putting. One example of this is the ending of Inception, which left many viewers scratching their heads and debating what it all meant. While some praised Nolan for leaving the ending open to interpretation, others felt frustrated by the lack of closure and clarity. But despite these criticisms, Nolan's movies continue to be some of the most thought-provoking and visually stunning films of our time. From the mind-bending Inception to the epic Dunkirk, Nolan's movies are always ambitious and challenging, pushing the boundaries of what cinema can achieve. And while Nolan may not be as meticulous as Fincher or other directors when it comes to every shot and detail, he still manages to create unforgettable moments and images that stay with the viewer long after the credits roll. Take, for example, the opening scene of The Dark Knight, where the Joker robs a bank and sets the tone for the rest of the movie. The scene is masterfully crafted, with every shot and movement contributing to the tension and chaos of the moment. And the reveal of the Joker's face at the end of the scene is one of the most iconic moments in recent movie history. Or consider the stunning visuals of Interstellar, which take the viewer on a journey through space and time that is both awe-inspiring and emotionally resonant. The scene where Cooper watches video messages from his children, who have aged years in the time he's been away, is heartbreaking and powerful, thanks in large part to Nolan's direction and the performances of Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy. In the end, Nolan's approach to filmmaking may not be for everyone. But for those who appreciate his ambition, his willingness to take risks, and his ability to create unforgettable moments and images, his movies are a true cinematic experience. And while he may not be as meticulous as some other directors, he still manages to create movies that are both thought-provoking and entertaining, challenging and thrilling, and always worth watching again and again.
