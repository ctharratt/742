The Fallout franchise has been around for quite some time now, and it's no secret that the developers have had years to perfect their craft. However, it's interesting to note that even with all that experience, a female sole survivor can just walk right in and start playing. This is a testament to the game's accessibility and ease of use, which is something that has remained consistent throughout the series. One thing that has changed over the years is the availability of powerful weapons and armor. In Fallout 3, players could obtain a fat man super early on, but it couldn't be used all the time. This is similar to the power armor in Fallout 4, which is like having a really nice car but no gas to fuel it. This makes players want to keep playing in order to get what they need, which is a great way to keep players engaged. However, in New Vegas and Fallout 4, the need for training to use certain weapons and armor gets retconned. This is a bit of a departure from previous games, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. It allows players to jump right in and start playing without having to worry about training or other prerequisites. One thing that is interesting to note is the sales figures for games like Black Flag. While it sold around 8 million copies in 2013, it has since extended beyond that to 11 million. This shows that developers know how much they can make from lasting sales, and it's something that they take into account when designing their games. When it comes to first-person shooters, it's not uncommon to only see your character's hands and arms. While some games do have the rest of your body visible, not all do. Implementing the arms would offer more apparent realism than a full body, and it's something that could be done relatively easily. It's important to note that game development takes time, and it's something that people should be more patient about. The slow development cycle is often criticized, but it's something that is necessary in order to create a quality product. When it comes to games like DayZ, the issue is that the game doesn't look at context. A kill is a kill, regardless of the circumstances. This can lead to people losing trust in each other and becoming killers themselves. It's a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break. One thing that is interesting to note is that Fallout 4 is a good game, but it's not perfect. However, if you liked the story aspect of the game, there are plenty of resources available online that can help you explore that aspect of the game further. When it comes to game engines, it's important to note that they are often revisions of previous engines. For example, the Skyrim engine is a revision of the Fallout 3 engine. This is something that is common in the industry, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. When it comes to building a gaming PC, there are a lot of factors to consider. Budget is obviously a big one, but there are also things like performance, monitor size, and other factors to take into account. However, with a little research and some careful planning, it's possible to build a great gaming PC that will last for years to come. In conclusion, the Fallout franchise has come a long way over the years, and it's interesting to see how the developers have adapted to changing trends and technologies. While there are certainly areas where the games could be improved, overall they are great examples of what can be achieved with careful planning and attention to detail. Whether you're a fan of the series or just getting started, there's something for everyone in the Fallout universe.
