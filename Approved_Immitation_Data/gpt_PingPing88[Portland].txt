As someone who has lived in both Forest Grove and Gresham, I can attest to the fact that commuting in the Portland area can be a nightmare. While Forest Grove was certainly not as bad as Gresham, the reality is that any commute in the Portland area can be a challenge. The traffic on I5 and 84 can be unbearable at times, and it can be difficult to find a job with similar pay and benefits in a more convenient location. Living in Gresham has its advantages, of course. For one thing, I am able to live here for near-free, which is a huge benefit. However, I would love to live within walking distance to work, but the reality is that I have a hard time managing my income enough to pay for a typical rent. This means that I am forced to commute, which can be a real challenge. One of the biggest challenges of commuting in the Portland area is dealing with the weather. On Tuesday, for example, it was really wet, which made my commute even more difficult. I noticed that my brake pedal was pulsing slightly when I applied them, and I wasn't sure what was causing it. I thought it might be rust on my rotors from a car that had been sitting for years, but I couldn't find any when I inspected underneath. It turns out that my rotors might be warping, which could explain other issues I've had. I never thought about the rotors warping before, but I'll have to check them with a straight edge or something. Another challenge of commuting in the Portland area is dealing with road closures and washouts. Kane near MHCC just washed out a bit, and it looks like it's closed. My girlfriend sent me a video of it, and it's pretty crazy. It's always a good idea to check for road closures before heading out, especially during the rainy season. One tool that I have found to be incredibly helpful when commuting in the Portland area is Google Maps. I get mocked by my coworkers for using it, but the reality is that Google's ability to navigate around traffic is priceless. I use it for any drive over 20 minutes, and it comes in handy when commuting from East Gresham because going on 84 or going through Damascus and Clackamas take about the same amount of time for me. It's a life saver on days like today when one way is significantly longer than the other. However, today I ended up driving through neighborhoods on residential streets to get around slow traffic on the main road. I'm not the only one who has found Google Maps to be helpful when commuting in the Portland area. Many people use it to find the fastest route to work, especially during rush hour. Some people even use Waze, which is a social navigation app that allows drivers to share real-time traffic and road information. It's a great way to avoid accidents, road closures, and other hazards on the road. Of course, not everyone is a fan of Google Maps or Waze. Some people prefer to rely on their own sense of direction, or they simply don't trust technology. However, I think that using these tools can be incredibly helpful, especially when commuting in a city like Portland. One thing that I have noticed about commuting in the Portland area is that there is a lot of construction going on. It seems like there is always a new bridge or road being built, which can make commuting even more challenging. However, I think that this construction is necessary in order to improve the infrastructure of the city. It may be inconvenient in the short term, but it will ultimately make commuting easier and safer for everyone. Another thing that I have noticed about commuting in the Portland area is that there is a lot of debate about housing. Some people believe that the city needs more affordable housing, while others believe that the city needs more luxury housing. There is also a lot of debate about the design of new housing developments, with some people arguing that they are too ugly or too expensive. Personally, I think that the city needs more affordable housing. It's difficult to find a place to live that is both affordable and convenient, especially if you are on a tight budget. However, I also think that it's important to have a variety of housing options available, including luxury housing. This allows people to choose the type of housing that best suits their needs and their budget. One thing that I have noticed about commuting in the Portland area is that there is a lot of traffic congestion. This is especially true during rush hour, when everyone is trying to get to work or home. However, I think that there are some things that can be done to alleviate this congestion. For one thing, I think that more people should consider carpooling or taking public transportation. This would reduce the number of cars on the road, which would in turn reduce traffic congestion. Additionally, I think that the city could invest in more bike lanes and pedestrian walkways. This would encourage more people to walk or bike to work, which would also reduce traffic congestion. Finally, I think that it's important to remember that commuting in the Portland area can be challenging, but it's not impossible. With the right tools and the right mindset, it's possible to navigate the city's roads and highways with ease. Whether you prefer to use Google Maps or rely on your own sense of direction, there are ways to make commuting in the Portland area a little bit easier.
