I just don't get why people are so angry about Albert Pujols leaving the Cardinals. I mean, the guy gave us 11 seasons of incredible production, and he was only making an average of 10.2 million per year. That's like, nothing for the best player in baseball. I know that's just how baseball works, but still. You can't blame a guy for wanting to chase the money he thinks he deserves. It's like what's happening with Jose Bautista now. He's looking for a big contract, and he deserves it. He's been one of the best power hitters in baseball for the past few years. But the Blue Jays aren't going to offer him what he wants, so he's probably going to leave. And I don't blame him. It's just business. I loved Pujols when he was with the Cardinals, and I still do. I'll never rag on him for leaving. We got 11 years of his prime for a measly 10.2 million per year. That's insane. He should have been making like, 25 million per year. So when he wanted a bigger contract, I totally understood. I would have done the same thing. It's just common sense. But I have to admit, his contract with the Angels is starting to look pretty bad. He's getting paid like, 27.5 million per year now, and he's going to be 36 this year. He's still producing, but he's not the same player he was when he was with the Cardinals. I don't blame him for taking the money, but I can see why some people might be upset about it. Speaking of upset, have you seen some of the comments on that article about the Cardinals holding off the Cubs? People are freaking out about the age of our team, like that's going to be the deciding factor in whether we win or not. Age doesn't win games, production does. It doesn't matter if you have a team full of 40 year olds or 20 year olds. If they can produce, they can win. And the Cardinals have a lot of guys who can produce. Sure, we lost Heyward and Lackey, and we didn't sign a big power bat like Davis. But that doesn't mean we're going to suck. We still have a talented team, and we have some great pitching. Waino, Wacha, CarMart, Leake, Garcia - that's a solid rotation. Yeah, CarMart is coming back from injury, and Garcia is a bit of a wild card, but we have some depth in our pitching staff. We'll be fine. And let's not forget about our bullpen. Rosenthal, Siegrist, Maness - those guys are all solid. Plus, we re-signed Broxton, we have Walden back, and we took a chance on Oh. Our bullpen is going to be just fine. The only real concern we have is Molina's injury. We need him to be healthy for the long haul, so if he needs to miss the first week or two of the season, that's fine. We can't rush him back and risk aggravating the injury. But even without Molina, we have a great team. We have some young guys who are going to step up and produce, and we have some veterans who are still going strong. I know some people are worried about the Cubs, but I'm not. They're a great team, don't get me wrong. But so are we. We have a lot of talent, and we have a lot of heart. We're not going to roll over and let the Cubs take the division. We're going to fight, and we're going to win. So let's stop worrying about age and contracts and all that nonsense. Let's focus on what really matters - winning. The Cardinals have a great team, and we're going to show everyone what we're made of. Go Cards!
