The recent Republican National Committee (RNC) debate was a complete disaster. The moderators were biased, the questions were leading, and the audience reactions were hilariously overacted. It was clear that the RNC was trying to stack the deck against Donald Trump, but all they did was make themselves look like blustering children and strengthen Trump's position. The RNC's heavy-handed tactics were obvious from the start. The moderators asked leading questions that were clearly designed to trip up the candidates and make them look bad. They also gave Rubio a lot of airtime and allowed him to speak uninterrupted, while cutting off Trump and giving him little time to respond. The audience reactions were also clearly staged, with the Rubio supporters overacting and the Trump supporters remaining silent. All of this was a huge mistake on the part of the RNC. By treating the base like idiots and trying to manipulate the debate, they only made themselves look bad and strengthened Trump's position. Trump has been able to tap into the anger and frustration of the Republican base, and the RNC's tactics only reinforced the idea that the establishment is out of touch and doesn't care about the concerns of ordinary Americans. The RNC's tactics were not limited to this debate, however. They have been trying to stack the deck against Trump for months, and it's not just CNN that is guilty of this. The MSNBC RNC debates were just as stacked with establishment audiences, and Telemundo is owned by NBCUniversal, just like MSNBC. This is a pure establishment circus, and it's clear that the RNC is more interested in maintaining the status quo than in listening to the concerns of the base. As a super liberal, I find all of this very amusing. The Republican party is tearing itself apart, and it's clear that they have no idea how to deal with Trump. But as much as I enjoy watching the chaos, I also think that the RNC's tactics are dangerous. By trying to manipulate the debate and stack the deck against Trump, they are undermining the democratic process and making it harder for the Republican party to come together and unite behind a candidate. The RNC's tactics are not just limited to this election cycle, either. They have been trying to manipulate the political process for years, and it's clear that they are more interested in maintaining their own power than in serving the interests of the American people. This is why I am a super liberal: I believe in freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right of all Americans to participate in the political process. Unfortunately, there are many people on the left who do not share these beliefs. They believe in political correctness, censorship, and restrictions on freedom of speech. They are obsessed with issues like trigger warnings, safe spaces, and microaggressions, and they are more interested in policing language than in engaging in meaningful political discourse. As a super liberal, I find all of this deeply troubling. I believe that political correctness is a form of censorship, and that it is antithetical to the principles of free speech and open debate. I also believe that the hysteria around GMOs and vaccines is unfounded, and that restrictions on guns are a violation of the Second Amendment. But despite my disagreements with some on the left, I still believe that we need to come together and work towards a more just and equitable society. We need to listen to each other, engage in meaningful dialogue, and find common ground. We need to reject the politics of division and fear, and embrace the politics of hope and unity. In the end, the RNC's tactics will only serve to strengthen Trump's position and undermine the democratic process. They are playing a dangerous game, and it's not clear that they will come out on top. But regardless of the outcome of this election, we need to remember that democracy is a fragile thing, and that we must work to protect it at all costs.
