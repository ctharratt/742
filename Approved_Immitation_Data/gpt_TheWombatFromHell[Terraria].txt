I don't understand why people are so obsessed with making new playthroughs just because of the Celestial Invasion. It doesn't prevent you from doing anything else in the game, so why bother starting over? Instead, why not change up the meta a bit? Use different shaped rooms and more building materials to give your builds a more natural feel. I mean, have you seen Otherworld's "artsy" direction? It looks so peaceful and neat. I don't like the way some players just throw all their separate buildings into a very tight space without any symmetry or cohesion. It's just messy and unappealing to look at. And don't even get me started on the whole phone vs. PC debate. I mean, sure, a phone isn't technically an accessory, but you can always just use a monitor instead. What's the point of using a PC if you're just going to keep the dash velocity? And why would you even want to zoom in? It just makes everything look blocky and unappealing. I think you should smooth out some of the edges and make everything look more polished. As for the whole throwing weapons vs. melee weapons debate, I think it's a bit silly to take away the two strongest golem tier melee weapons just to make them throwing weapons. Plus, none of these weapons are even consumable, so it just doesn't make sense. And who are you to tell people what to do? If someone wants to use boomerangs, let them. Just ignore them if you don't like it. It's not like you're the Terraria police or anything. And don't even get me started on the whole "lets play" thing. I mean, why would I want to watch someone else play when I could just go do the exact same thing myself? It's just boring and pointless. And as for the whole "greater good" thing, there is no part of this game where you should be taking hits for the greater good. It just leaves you open to punishment and makes everything worse. But let's talk about something positive for a change. Red, please put world gen toggle settings in the game. That would be awesome! And have you seen the cuffs? They're just amazing. And the knife is just insane. I used it all the way to the Celestial event with early hardmode armor and had no problems. And for all you prehardmode mages out there, here's a guide for you: find lava, throw all your mage equipment in, craft a sword, and you're done. It's that easy. And if you're looking for some building inspiration, check out this non-box build I'm working on. It's my first one, and I'm really excited about it. All I have so far for materials is mudstone and stone slab, so if anyone has any suggestions for material, decor, or features, please comment! And don't even get me started on griefing. It's the most horrible crime in the gaming world. It shows complete disrespect for someone, destroys hours of heartfelt artwork, and shows a lack of empathy and conscience. It's just not cool. But let's end on a positive note. Have you seen some of the amazing builds people have made in this game? They're just incredible. And the music is just so beautiful. My personal favorites are The Wings March, The Tunnel Through, Wake, Aurora, and Meadow. And if you're looking for some tips on how to defeat bosses, just remember to use maneuverability and change up your strategy if you need to. And if you're looking for some building inspiration, check out this amazing underground dungeon/catacombs someone made in the valley between the Dungeon and the Ocean. It's just so cool. In conclusion, Terraria is an amazing game with so much depth and creativity. And while there may be some debates and disagreements within the community, we can all agree on one thing: this game is just awesome.
