I never thought I'd see the day when I would have to deal with parking spot drama in my own neighborhood. It's like a never-ending battle between the entitled and the considerate. And let me tell you, it's not pretty. It all started when I moved into my new house in a neighborhood with assigned parking. Each house gets one spot, and there are a few visitor spots scattered throughout the area. Seemed simple enough, right? Wrong. There's this one family, let's call them the Smiths, who have a visitor spot right in front of their house and directly next to their assigned spot. And they always park in the visitor spot first, even if their assigned spot is open. It's like they're trying to hoard parking spots or something. And it doesn't stop there. When the husband leaves for work, he pulls his car out of the visitor spot and then parks it in his assigned spot, and then moves his other car into the visitor spot. So not only are they taking up two spots, but they're also inconveniencing everyone else who needs to park in the visitor spot. I've watched them do this multiple times, and it's infuriating. If I ever get that visitor spot, I'm leaving my car in it and buying a new car just to spite them. But then again, that would make me just as petty as they are. The worst part is that the community office says they can't really do anything about it since it's a visitor spot and available to anyone. I read between the lines as they have other things to worry about, like the Latino gangs in the neighborhood, to deal with this "spot camper." But it's not just the Smiths who are causing problems. There's also this one guy who parked his busted, out-of-inspection work van in the very first visitor spot, the one closest to everyone's door. And he didn't move that van for over six months. If it was broken down, he could have parked it on the side street and it wouldn't have been taking up a space. They know about it, but they can't really do much. That person has even left threatening notes on people's cars who park in that spot. I managed to get it one afternoon back in March, and I came out later to get something from my car and there was a note on the windshield... "Make sure this is the last time you park here." It's like a warzone out there, and I'm just trying to find a parking spot without getting threatened or towed. And it's not just my neighborhood, it's everywhere. People are so entitled these days, they think they can just park wherever they want and inconvenience everyone else. I live in a neighborhood with a lot of Latin Americans, and sometimes there are 15 or more people living in a small townhouse and they all have cars. So there are way more cars in the neighborhood than parking spaces. But that's not an excuse to be selfish and take up more than your fair share of spots. I can't abide the murder of innocent dogs, but the beating of that human was certainly deserved. Wait, sorry, got a little off-topic there. But seriously, people need to learn some basic manners and consideration for others when it comes to parking. And it's not just parking, it's everything. People are so focused on themselves and their own needs that they forget about the people around them. It's like they're living in their own little bubble, oblivious to the world outside. But I refuse to let them get me down. I will continue to park in my assigned spot and avoid the drama as much as possible. Real men don't get goaded into doing something stupid. Just let it go. Be the bigger man. And maybe, just maybe, if we all start being a little more considerate and mindful of others, we can make the world a better place. It's a small step, but it's a start.
