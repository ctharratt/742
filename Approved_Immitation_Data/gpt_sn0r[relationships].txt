Well, well, well, it seems like we have quite the situation on our hands. From addiction to relationships to workplace harassment, there's a lot to unpack here. But fear not, my dear reader, for I am here to offer my two cents on each of these issues. Let's start with the addiction. It's concerning that your girlfriend seems to think that intentionally hurting each other is a normal part of a healthy relationship. That's simply not true. While it's true that people make mistakes and sometimes hurt their partners unintentionally, it's not okay to intentionally hurt someone and then expect them to just "deal with it." That's not love, that's manipulation. As for the money situation, it's great that you're good with money, but that doesn't mean you should be solely responsible for all the bills and expenses. It's important to have a partnership where both parties contribute equally. Going Dutch on vacations and dinners is a great idea, and it's important to make your partner feel like a stakeholder in the relationship. Now, onto the relationship itself. It's clear that there are some communication issues here. Your wife needs to respect your opinion, and you need to be able to express your feelings to her without fear of judgment or dismissal. It's important to fight it out when there's a problem and not let it fester inside you. And when it comes to your friends, it's important to confront their passive-aggressive behavior and suggest a timeout to hash things out in a neutral environment. But let's talk about the showering situation. It's perfectly normal for a 7-year-old to shower with their mom or bathe with their sibling. It's not a sexual thing, it's just a practical thing. And it's important not to mess with a child's body image or sexuality at such a young age. Educate yourself on this topic and don't make assumptions based on your own discomfort. Moving on to the workplace harassment. It's unacceptable for your boss to call your wife incompetent and lazy. Keep a logbook of any such behavior and print out any emails where he acts out. This could be considered a hostile work environment, which HR can deal with if things escalate. And if you're allergic to dogs and your roommate refuses to get rid of them, that's a health issue. Get your doctor to sign off on your allergy and see if there's a dispute arbitration committee you can contact. And finally, the rollerblades. I have to admit, this one has me stumped. How do you even set rollerblades on fire? It's starting to sound like a made-up story. But if it's true, then it's clear that your roommate has some serious issues that need to be addressed. In conclusion, there's a lot going on here. But the key takeaway is that communication is key. Talk to your partner, your friends, your boss, and your roommate. Don't let things fester inside you. And remember, intentional hurt is not love.
