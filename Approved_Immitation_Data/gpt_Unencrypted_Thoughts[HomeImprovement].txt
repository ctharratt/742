When it comes to remodeling your home, there are a lot of things to consider. One of the most important areas to focus on is the bathroom. Bathrooms are often small spaces, but they can have a big impact on the overall look and feel of your home. In this article, I'll share some tips and tricks for remodeling your bathroom, including materials to use, how to handle wet areas, and the importance of good ventilation. First and foremost, let's talk about materials. When it comes to bathroom remodeling, you don't need to spend a lot of money on materials. Porcelain tiles with a good PEI rating are a great option. You can find some good tiles at home depot or lowes for $1-$2/sq ft, sometimes even cheaper if it's a clear out. These tiles are durable and easy to clean, making them a great choice for a bathroom. When it comes to wet areas, especially old wet areas, I always recommend a full gut. You never really know how poor the previous builders were and you might find a lot of stuff wrong that you can fix now instead of having to tear down your newly remodeled stuff. Save up the extra money and get it done right the first time. Also, make sure you have good ventilation to prevent future problems. It's funny how a simple working fan vent can prevent so many issues. Now, let's talk about tools. A good tape measure is essential for any remodeling project. I love my fatmax. It feels so sturdy. I've got a 16' and a 25' that came in a cheap pack. I'll never use anything else, not that I'll have a chance to buy anything else. A good tape measure will help you get accurate measurements and ensure that everything fits properly. When it comes to appliances, a double oven can be a great addition to your bathroom. I love my LG double oven. I use the smaller upper oven more than the lower so it's nice that it pre-heats much faster. I had it for about 3 years now and haven't had any issues. The blue interior is a nice touch too. Now, let's talk about flooring. If you're replacing carpet in your bathroom, you'll need to make sure that the subfloor is flat. You normally can't determine flatness of a subfloor with carpet on it but 1.75" is a huge amount. It's not really their fault. Your cheapest option is to just put new carpet back in. If you want it fixed, you'll need to fill the low spots and grind down the high spots. You don't need the subfloor level, just flat. I rented a big concrete grinder that you push with a vacuum attachment. My subfloor was nowhere near as bad as yours was though. If you don't know what you're doing, just hire someone to do it. Many hardwood installers sub this work out to concrete contractors so you can try giving them a call. When it comes to HVAC, it's important to get a good unit installed. I paid around that price for a 17 seer Trane unit installed. Trane and Lennox seem to be very common in Socal and have good reviews. I'm not super knowledgeable about HVAC but noticed your quote didn't mention anything about the evap coil. Have you gotten any other quotes? Make sure the company has good reviews. Now, let's talk about doors. If you're replacing hollow core doors with solid core doors, I'd run 3 hinges. You can easily add a third hinge with a router and a template plate. Definitely use self-leveling compound, it's pricey but worth it. I'd rent a concrete grinder with a diamond bit and a vacuum attachment. You'll have the job done in minutes. When it comes to countertops, it's important to make sure that they're installed properly. If water is leaking through the ceiling, you need to gut the thing and inspect/fix all the water damage before you start to rebuild. Kerdi recommends using standard drywall instead of cement board but it can be installed on either. It needs to cover everything. All vapor barriers should cover the entire surface, not just joints. I would do a lot more research before you start to do anything otherwise you might end up with what looks like a nice finished product only to have major issues years down the road. Moisture sandwiches are never ideal. Now, let's talk about design. Contrast makes things look great. White on white looks horrible, especially when they don't match. If you want cabinets, go with dark counter tops and back splash. I've had cali bamboo hand scraped fossilized flooring for 3 years in socal and it still looks brand new. I did a glue down installation on a concrete subfloor. Humidity shouldn't be a problem as long as you allow the planks to acclimate to your house before you start the installation. When it comes to pricing, it's important to make sure that you're not being overcharged. Is that a new construction price with the stucco/siding repairs or a retrofit price? If it's new construction, it seems reasonable. You need to give more details. Exactly how many windows, are they all standard size? There's nothing wrong with drywall if you use the proper waterproofing. Kerdi recommends drywall over cement board or hardibacker. That's an insane amount. I know NYC is going to be more expensive than socal but that's still way too much for kerdi on the walls, ditra on the floor, and mud / kerdi shower pan and drain. Find another contractor. When it comes to plants, it's important to choose the right type. There is a big difference between running bamboo and clumping bamboo. Running bamboo is invasive and should never be planted without proper precautions as to not let it escape. Finally, let's talk about payment. It's important to make sure that you're not being taken advantage of. Have him draw up a schedule and build a payment plan based off of that. 10% at sign of contract, x% after day 1, x% after demo completion, x% rough framing, x% drywall hanged, taped, and textured. My main concern is that if he's using your down payment to pay off his previous job then that means he isn't paying his subs right away for your job. That means these subs can put on a lien on your house until he pays them, even though you already paid your GC. As the home owner, you're responsible for making sure the subs get paid. In conclusion, remodeling your bathroom can be a daunting task, but with the right materials, tools, and design, you can create a beautiful and functional space. Make sure to do your research, hire a reputable contractor, and don't be afraid to ask questions. Good luck with your remodeling project!
