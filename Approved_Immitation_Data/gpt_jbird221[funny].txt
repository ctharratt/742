East? Weast? I don't know which way is up anymore. But hey, here's a random fact for ya: did you know that the word "tattoo" comes from the Tahitian word "tatau"? Yeah, I didn't either until I Googled it. Speaking of tattoos, what do you do if you're a tattoo artist and you see a spelling error in the design? Do you tell the customer or just go with it? I mean, I guess it depends on the situation. If it's a small error that won't affect the overall design, maybe just let it slide. But if it's a major mistake, like misspelling someone's name, then you gotta speak up. Otherwise, that person is gonna be stuck with a permanent reminder of their own stupidity. And speaking of mistakes, have you ever dropped something and it landed just a few inches away from where it was supposed to go? Like, you're trying to put a dish in the sink and it slips out of your hand, but instead of falling into the sink, it lands on the counter right next to it. Or you're trying to throw a piece of trash into the garbage can, but it bounces off the rim and lands on the floor right next to the can. It's like, come on, gravity, do your job! But hey, at least it's not as bad as dropping something down a chute and having it miss the mark by a few feet. That's gotta be frustrating. Speaking of frustrating, have you ever tried to read a sign from the inside of a building and realized you can't see it from that angle? That's what happened to ol' me here. I always make sure to turn on the Coors sign before opening the bar in the morning, but one day my buddy Dennis pointed out that the sign actually said "CLOSED." Whoops. I guess you can't really read it from the inside. But hey, at least I'm not the only one who's made that mistake. Apparently, even Mac couldn't read it from the outside. So there. Speaking of mistakes (again), have you ever had one too many drinks and regretted it the next day? Yeah, me too. That extra ounce can really do a number on ya. But hey, at least we can learn from our mistakes and not make the same ones again. And speaking of learning, did you know that Samuel L. Jackson played a villain with a lisp in the Kingsmen movie? His name was Valentine. Great flick, by the way. And while we're on the topic of great things, can we talk about Dr. Spaceman quotes for a second? "Thanks for not making me wear a condom, that was pretty fuckin classy." Classic. Speaking of classy (sort of), have you ever seen a rooster drawing that looked more like a penis than a rooster? Yeah, me neither. But apparently it's a thing. And speaking of things, have you ever heard of a pee bib? It's a thing too, apparently. It's like a bib for your junk so you don't get pee on your pants. Genius, right? And speaking of genius, can we talk about Lord of the Rings for a second? One ring to rule them all. That's some epic shit right there. Speaking of epic shit, have you ever read a Google poem that uplifted your sadness? I don't even know what that means, but apparently it's a thing too. And speaking of things that are unexpected, did you know that Kevin's voice can make anything sound funny? I mean, I didn't expect to read that Google poem in his voice, but it definitely made it more entertaining. And speaking of entertainment, have you seen the Kingsmen movie? Samuel L. Jackson is a boss in that flick. And speaking of bosses, I gotta give a shoutout to all the tattoo artists out there. You guys are the real MVPs. Speaking of MVPs, have you ever dropped something and it landed just a few inches away from where it was supposed to go? Oh wait, I already talked about that. But seriously, it's like gravity has a mind of its own sometimes. And speaking of minds, have you ever wondered what goes on in the mind of a tattoo artist when they see a spelling error in a design? I mean, do they cringe and want to fix it, or do they just go with the flow and hope nobody notices? It's a tough call, man. Speaking of tough calls, have you ever tried to read a sign from the inside of a building and realized you can't see it from that angle? Oh wait, I already talked about that too. But seriously, it's like the sign was designed to be read from the outside or something. And speaking of design, have you ever seen a tattoo that was so well done, it looked like a work of art? I mean, some of these artists are seriously talented. And speaking of talent, can we talk about Dr. Spaceman quotes for a second? "Thanks for not making me wear a condom, that was pretty fuckin classy." I mean, come on, that's comedy gold right there. Speaking of comedy gold, have you ever seen a rooster drawing that looked more like a penis than a rooster? Oh wait, I already talked about that too. But seriously, who draws a rooster that way? And speaking of drawing, have you ever tried to draw something and it just didn't turn out the way you wanted it to? Yeah, me too. But hey, practice makes perfect, right? And speaking of practice, have you ever tried to pee without getting any on your pants and failed miserably? Yeah, me too. But hey, that's what pee bibs are for. Speaking of pee bibs, have you ever wondered what it would be like to have one? I mean, it's gotta be weird, right? But hey, if it keeps your pants dry, who cares? And speaking of keeping things dry, have you ever tried to drink a Coors and ended up spilling it all over yourself? Yeah, me too. But hey, that's just part of the experience. And speaking of experiences, have you ever watched Lord of the Rings and felt like you were part of the adventure? I mean, that movie is a masterpiece. Speaking of masterpieces, have you ever seen a tattoo that was so well done, it looked like a work of art? Oh wait, I already talked about that too.
