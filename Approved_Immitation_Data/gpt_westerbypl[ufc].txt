The world of mixed martial arts is always buzzing with news and rumors, and as a fan, it's hard to keep up with everything that's going on. From upcoming fights to fighter drama, there's always something to talk about. Here are some of the latest topics that have been on my mind. First off, let's talk about the recent comments made by a certain thug. While I don't necessarily agree with everything he said, I do think that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Personally, I think that Holm has a great body, but I can see why someone might prefer RRR's physique. As for PVZ, she's definitely a looker, but I wouldn't necessarily put her above all the ring girls. And while I don't think RRR is the sexiest woman in the UFC, I do think she's a fantastic athlete and a great fighter. Moving on to some of the recent fights, I have to say that Aldo's injury before the first fight with McGregor was a huge disappointment. It was one of the fights I was most looking forward to, and it was a shame that it didn't happen. As for the fight of the year, I definitely agree that it was a great one. However, I do think that some of the other awards were given to the most popular fighters rather than the most deserving ones. Speaking of popular fighters, there's been a lot of talk about the recent signing of a certain WWE superstar. While I can see why the UFC would want to bring him in for the publicity, I'm not sure how valuable he'll actually be in the long run. He may be able to sell some PPVs, but I don't think he has the technical knowledge to be a good analyst. And with all his past injuries and concussions, I'm not sure if he'll even be allowed to fight. Moving on to some of the upcoming fights, I'm really looking forward to the matchup between two veterans who are both in need of a win. While neither of them is likely to get a title shot anytime soon, they're both still big names in the sport and should put on a great show. And while I'm excited to see what the rising stars of the sport can do, I think it's important to give the veterans their due as well. Finally, let's talk about some of the recent controversies in the sport. From fighters getting caught using performance-enhancing drugs to coaches committing fraud, there's been a lot of negative news lately. While it's important to hold these people accountable for their actions, I think it's also important to remember that not everyone in the sport is like that. There are plenty of fighters and coaches who are great role models and who represent the sport well. Overall, there's always something to talk about in the world of mixed martial arts. Whether it's upcoming fights, fighter drama, or controversies, there's never a dull moment. As a fan, it's important to stay informed and to form your own opinions on these topics. And while we may not always agree with each other, we can all come together to appreciate the sport that we love.
