The Oath Keepers: A Fringe Group or a Legitimate Movement? In 2009, a group called the Oath Keepers was formed. The group consists of Firemen, EMTs, Police Officers, and retired military. They advocate the arming of American citizens to defend against the imminent collapse of the American economy. The group associates with extremely paranoid conspiracy groups, but their leader, a Yale-educated lawyer, seems relatively calm and sensible. The group even took out a billboard to defend Snowden. However, the group is often associated with bonafide crazies, and their beliefs are often dismissed as fringe, right-wing conspiracy theories. The Oath Keepers believe that the government is on the verge of collapse and that the American people need to be prepared to defend themselves. They believe that the government is preparing to take away their guns and that they need to be ready to fight back. They also believe that the government is preparing to declare martial law and that they need to be prepared to resist. The group's leader, Stewart Rhodes, is a Yale-educated lawyer who served as a paratrooper in the Army. He founded the group in response to what he saw as a growing threat to the Constitution. He believes that the government is becoming increasingly authoritarian and that the American people need to be prepared to defend their rights. Rhodes has been criticized for his association with extremist groups, but he has defended his beliefs and his association with these groups. He has said that he is not a racist or a white supremacist and that he does not support violence. He has also said that he believes in the rule of law and that he is not advocating for an armed rebellion. The Oath Keepers have been involved in a number of controversial incidents. In 2014, they were involved in the standoff at the Bundy Ranch in Nevada. They also provided security for businesses during the protests in Ferguson, Missouri. In 2016, they were involved in the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. The group's beliefs have been criticized by many, including law enforcement officials and politicians. They have been accused of promoting violence and of being a threat to public safety. Some have even called for the group to be labeled as a domestic terrorist organization. Despite the criticism, the Oath Keepers continue to grow in popularity. They have chapters in all 50 states and have thousands of members. They have also been involved in a number of charitable activities, including providing disaster relief and helping veterans. So, are the Oath Keepers a legitimate movement or a fringe group? The answer is not clear-cut. On the one hand, the group's beliefs are often dismissed as conspiracy theories, and their association with extremist groups is concerning. On the other hand, the group's leader is a Yale-educated lawyer who has defended his beliefs and his association with these groups. The group has also been involved in a number of charitable activities and has thousands of members. Ultimately, the question of whether the Oath Keepers are a legitimate movement or a fringe group is a matter of perspective. Some may see them as a threat to public safety, while others may see them as defenders of the Constitution. Regardless of one's opinion, it is clear that the group's beliefs and actions are controversial and will continue to be the subject of debate.
