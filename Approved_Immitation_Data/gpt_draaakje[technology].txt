As technology continues to evolve, it's important to take a step back and evaluate the current state of the industry. One topic that has been garnering attention lately is the future of Apple and its flagship product, the iPhone. While the iPhone has undoubtedly been a massive success for Apple, there are concerns about what comes next. As Daniel Tello pointed out, over the past 12 months, the iPhone business grew by 52%, but everything else, rolled together, shrank by 3%. This raises the question of what happens when people move on from smartphones to the next big thing. Will Apple be able to keep up and create another equally successful product? One thing that has been a hallmark of Apple's success is its focus on design. The iPhone, in particular, has been praised for its sleek and visually appealing design. However, there are concerns that Apple may be sacrificing functionality for form. For example, the MacBook Pro has great build quality that rivals the Surface Book, but it lacks certain features like a touchscreen and detachable tablet that the Surface Book offers. This focus on design over functionality has also led to issues like the need for cases to protect the iPhone. While cases can certainly add to the visual appeal of the device, they can also detract from it and make it bulkier. This has led to two groups of smartphone owners: those who shelled out the extra money for a decent case and those with cracked screens. It's important to note that design is still a crucial aspect of technology. A visually appealing product can be a major selling point, but it shouldn't come at the expense of functionality. The Surface Book, for example, may not be as visually appealing as the MacBook Pro, but it offers more functionality. Another concern with Apple's future is its reliance on the iPhone. While the iPhone has been a massive success, it's important for Apple to diversify its product offerings. This is especially true as the smartphone market becomes increasingly saturated and competitive. One potential area for Apple to explore is augmented reality (AR). AR has been gaining traction in recent years, and Apple has already made moves in this direction with the release of ARKit. However, it remains to be seen if Apple can create a product that is as successful as the iPhone. It's also worth noting that Apple's success has been built on the backs of some of the most respected authorities in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction and User Interface Design. Don Norman and Bruce Tognazzini are two such authorities, and their work has influenced pretty much all work in UID. While some may criticize their work for not having commercial success, it's important to remember that a lot of what is applied in industry has its roots in academia. Criticism is also important for Apple's growth and improvement. Just because something is popular doesn't mean it's good. The iPhone may be a sales success, but that doesn't mean it's perfect. Criticism can help Apple identify areas for improvement and create even better products in the future. In conclusion, while the iPhone has been a massive success for Apple, there are concerns about what comes next. Apple needs to diversify its product offerings and focus on both design and functionality. AR may be a potential area for Apple to explore, but it remains to be seen if they can create a product that is as successful as the iPhone. Criticism is also important for Apple's growth and improvement, and it's important to remember that a lot of what is applied in industry has its roots in academia.
