Alright, let's talk wrestling. Specifically, let's talk about the recent rumors and news surrounding the WWE and other promotions. First up, the potential multi-man match at WrestleMania featuring the Dudleys, Usos, Lucha Dragons, and New Day. Personally, I'm not too excited about this one. It feels like a bit of a throwaway match, and I'm not sure how much it will add to the overall WrestleMania experience. That being said, I'm always willing to be pleasantly surprised. Moving on to Brock Lesnar, who is apparently still incredibly over with the fans. I have to admit, I'm a bit surprised by this. Don't get me wrong, I think Lesnar is a fantastic athlete and a great performer, but I feel like his character has become a bit stale. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like we've seen everything there is to see from Lesnar at this point. As for TNA, I think it's a shame that so many people dismiss it out of hand. Sure, it's not as big or as well-known as the WWE, but that doesn't mean it's not worth watching. In fact, I think TNA has some of the most talented wrestlers in the business right now, and it's a shame that more people don't give them a chance. Moving on to the Styles Clash kick out, I have to say that I'm not as upset about it as I thought I would be. Sure, it's a bit disappointing to see such a devastating finisher get kicked out of, but at the same time, it's not the end of the world. Styles is still an incredible wrestler, and I have no doubt that he'll continue to put on great matches regardless of whether or not he can hit the Styles Clash. As for the Wyatts, I really hope they win their match in under five minutes. I think it's important for them to make a statement and establish themselves as a dominant force in the WWE. Plus, it would be a nice callback to the Shield's early days. Moving on to Lucha Underground, I have to say that I'm incredibly impressed by the show's viewership numbers. It's clear that there's a real hunger for alternative wrestling programming, and I think that's a great thing for the industry as a whole. I'm also curious to see how well Lucha Underground DVDs would sell, as I think there's a real market for them. As for NXT, I'm excited to see what the future holds for the women's division. Bayley has been an incredible champion, but I think it's time for someone else to step up and take the title. Personally, I'm rooting for Asuka, as I think she's one of the most talented wrestlers in the world right now. Finally, I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed by the recent news surrounding Kong. It's never easy to see someone's career come to an end, especially under such unfortunate circumstances. That being said, I think it's important to remember that Kong made some mistakes, and that there are consequences for those mistakes. I wish her all the best in her future endeavors, and I hope that she's able to find happiness and success outside of the wrestling world. Overall, I think it's an exciting time to be a wrestling fan. There are so many great promotions out there, and so many talented wrestlers to watch. Whether you're a fan of the WWE, TNA, Lucha Underground, or any other promotion, there's something out there for everyone. So let's sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.
