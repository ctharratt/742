No, it's not. I've accepted that I will never see this. At this point, I've decided that the bleep was extra chromosomes. Cue Gav's confusion. You're a retard. No, the lads will always be Ray, Gavin, and Michael. You can't take this away from me. People were seriously considering unsubscribing. It blew my mind how accurately Michael was representing the comments. Yeah, it's either a game show or GTA video. That's a ton of videos still, but I will find this quote. I just wish I hadn't remembered it because it will annoy me until I find it. Fell asleep listening to Internet Box last night. Started with the XX episode because of Gavin, and now I'm headed back to the beginning. This should be interesting. You're not wrong, he says it, and thanks for finding this, but this isn't what I was thinking of. However, thanks to this, I am now going to listen to the Internet Box. After I watch every single Let's Play to find one single line. Do you even watch Demo Disk? It's all referential. Bruce and Joel wrote the song, genius. What the fuck is this shit? Do you not watch their content? They put more work into the thumbnails now than before, so you're wrong there. They can change their name to Caiti and then become Caiti? Stop with this. The horse died long ago. That laugh is undeniable. Send it to me instead. Shit reply for a shittier post. Boy, what a quality post. If I got to see SW four days early, I would tell literally every human I could. I never thought I'd have to suck a dick. I guess that all changes tonight. I already bought my plane ticket, and I'm heading for the airport now. Blaine, I'm coming for you. With the way he's killing it on Twitch, that seems like a viable option for him now. Oh, Christ. Are they doing the awards? Have they mentioned anything about them? So many great wallpapers. Lawrence said they might for sponsors. The sub has a bad rep because a) it's clogged with useless posts that can be answered with either the search bar or Google, b) it's not somewhere that the community can interact. Everyone is such a stickler for the rules that if something could generate discussion within the community but isn't 110% related to RT, then it is removed. It was the livestream from the other day. Top comment on the most recent post about this question has the answer, making this thread utterly pointless. It does when this question is literally asked twice a day. They could always use the search bar, yaknow. I don't miss Ray too often, but it's videos like this that I do. Because while this was a great Let's Play, Ray really adds something to the trivia gameshow videos that they do. Especially with Gav's screw-ups, this video would have had some great Angry Ray. Jesus fucking Christ. Are you daft? Why else do they do any sponsorship? They are a company making money. Some people on this sub can really dumb. He doesn't do it on cam. It's after the video that he was mad and left. In my room. By myself, I just cheered when I read the title. Edit: Do wish they played two rounds like they usually do, but this was a great Let's Play nonetheless. Rule 8: be respectful, you little fucker. I'm personally a fan of the replay. He's still in the air. Because I end up rewinding anyway with PiP. They also have had two shaving company sponsors. I think Bruce might be a better singer than Michael. Only one way to decide. Bruce v. Michael 2016 Sing OFF. No, they take actual criticism seriously. It's dumbass shit like this that they make fun of. Omg, Geoff killed the characters. Unsubscribe diklike. 0/10 won't watch again. Yeah, he played the game to be entertaining just the same way Ryan would have done it. Also, I would love to see where Geoff and Michael said they purposefully mess up. The only thing I've seen is that like Gavin, they play in an unorthodox or unintended way that will most likely result in them failing but in a funny way. You're the kind of person they're making fun of. There already is a thread. I love seeing the flairs on their sub, then watching that scene. Then that whole season. It's a slippery slope. I bought some shit game just to fix mine. Cut to sneak peek of their next LP, a continuation of Dino Dads. Do they livestream the post-show? We need a Bruce v. Michael Sing off. They are the two best singers in their respective companies. Both can hit high notes alright and hold them fairly well. What the fuck is the point of the search bar? Nope, I asked, they said there was no way to get back into the old price point. I could afford the old price, but I can't do the new one. So I'm just lasting on the free sponsorship until they stop offering them. Why was I downvoted? This is the same thing he's going to get in his email. I watch a LOT of AH. Right now, I'm listening to them as I play Xbox, which I often do. But even in their Let's Play style videos, the face cam doesn't take away from anything. I'd know that scream anywhere. I would agree for most channels. But somehow, AH manages to make every game they play chaotic enough to warrant a face cam. At least in my opinion. I recently became a fan. Started with Open Haus, moved on to Demo Disk, and have now started Dude Soup. I don't think I'm missing out on too many jokes the way you would with AH. Hahaha, because Gavin invented the word Gaff ahahahaha. Hey Josh, serious question. What's it like to live in Blaine's shadow? Knowing that he's funnier and smarter and cooler in literally every way he lives his life. Right down to how he struggles to find a girlfriend. Is it hard? Not technically four parts though. You literally said you were upset that Michael didn't pull you behind the scenes to meet everyone. It was literally in that thread. I have no reason to lie about stuff when your post alone was absurd enough. Lol. I didn't even know you had a YouTube channel. And I commented on your idiotic post about floppy disks before I even knew it was you. You seem to have this weird obsession with me. And I tell people about your RTX freak out when they ask because it was fucking hilarious to witness. So no, I don't hate you. I just love comedy. No, it's never too soon. Congrats to Colton, but that does not look funny. You obviously weren't around for the Gingerbread Massacre of '88. This isn't even close to a political discussion. It shouldn't even BE A DISCUSSION. Which podcast edit didn't mean all caps? Tons of comments about Funhaus now. Just asked my younger sister. Confirmed this is, in fact, a save button. Are you 12? Do you seriously not know what a floppy disk is? Yup. Every video still eventually hits a million, not even including the website views. I'm in tears. I hadn't seen the original, so the song alone was hilarious, but this was fantastic. Are you and Gavin planning on finishing I am Bread? One of your best playthroughs in my opinion. I wouldn't say it's creepy. Meg's got one. I actually didn't know about the sub until you posted it. Unless you magically got skinny as hell and lost all your muscle. Yeah, I tuned in about halfway and was laughing my ass off the whole time. Fucking genius. You are a wizard. Have you seen my other comments?
