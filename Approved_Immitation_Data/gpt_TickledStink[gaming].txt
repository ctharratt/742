OP is a big fat phony. That's right, I said it. And I'm not afraid to say it again. OP is a big fat phony. Why do I say this? Well, let me tell you. First of all, OP claims to have never played a video game before. But I call BS on that. Everyone has played a video game at some point in their life. Even my grandma has played Tetris on her phone. So, unless OP has been living under a rock for their entire life, I find it hard to believe that they have never played a video game. Secondly, OP claims to have never heard of Mario Sunshine or Galaxy. Again, I call BS. These are two of the most popular Mario games of all time. Even people who don't play video games have heard of them. So, unless OP has been living in a cave for the past 20 years, I find it hard to believe that they have never heard of these games. But let's give OP the benefit of the doubt and say that they really have never played a video game before. They recently posted on Reddit asking for someone to gift them a PS3 so they can finally experience the joy of gaming. And while I applaud their enthusiasm, I have to wonder if a PS3 is really the best choice for a first-time gamer. Don't get me wrong, the PS3 is a great console. But it's also a bit outdated at this point. If OP really wants to experience the best that gaming has to offer, they should consider getting a PS4 or an Xbox One. These consoles have better graphics, more advanced gameplay mechanics, and a wider selection of games. Of course, this all depends on what kind of games OP is interested in. If they're looking for a more casual gaming experience, then a PS3 might be just fine. But if they want to dive headfirst into the world of gaming, then they should consider upgrading to a newer console. Now, let's talk about some of the games that OP might want to check out once they get their hands on a PS3 (or a PS4, if they take my advice). First up, we have Fallout 4. This game has been out for a few years now, but it's still one of the best RPGs out there. Sure, the story might be a bit lacking, but the gameplay is top-notch. And with the ability to mod the game on PC, there's always something new to discover. Another great game to check out is The Last of Us. This game is a masterpiece of storytelling and gameplay. It's a post-apocalyptic adventure that will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. And with the upcoming sequel, now is the perfect time to jump into this world. If OP is looking for something a bit more lighthearted, they should check out LittleBigPlanet. This game is a platformer that allows you to create your own levels and share them with the world. It's a great way to get creative and have some fun with friends. And finally, if OP is looking for a classic gaming experience, they should check out the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection. This collection includes some of the best games in the Metal Gear Solid series, all remastered in HD. It's a great way to experience some of the best stealth-action games of all time. So, there you have it. Some great games to check out once OP gets their hands on a PS3 (or a PS4, if they take my advice). And while I still think OP is a big fat phony, I do hope they enjoy their gaming experience. After all, gaming is one of the best ways to escape reality and have some fun.
