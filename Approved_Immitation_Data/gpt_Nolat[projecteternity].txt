I have to say, I'm not entirely impressed with Pillars of Eternity. Don't get me wrong, there are some things I really enjoy about the game, but overall, it feels a bit clunky and unpolished. One of my biggest gripes with the game is the UI. It's just not very clean or intuitive. There are pauses between lines of dialogue and when you initiate or end conversations, which can really break up the flow of the game. And when you finish talking to someone, the screen fades out, which gets old pretty quickly. Another thing that bothers me is the companions. I just don't find them very enjoyable to be around. There are some minor things that irk me too, like the fact that there's no easy way to see your to-hit modifier, which should be a basic feature in any D&D game. I also don't like how easy the expansion content is if you take your endgame party into it. It's pretty much a cakewalk, which takes away from the challenge and excitement of the game. And don't even get me started on the mods. Sure, there are some good ones out there, but they're not always compatible with each other or with the game itself. It's just a mess. But it's not all bad. There are some things I really enjoy about the game, like the flexibility of the Cipher character and the Ranger's ability to use their pet to mess with casters. And if you're a fan of Baldur's Gate, you'll probably enjoy Pillars of Eternity too. One thing that really stands out to me is the writing. There are some real gems in there, and the game does a great job of building its world and characters. I just wish the companion quests were a bit more fleshed out. And while the game can be a bit of a time sink, it's definitely worth it if you're a fan of the genre. Just be prepared to lose track of time and suddenly realize you've been playing for six hours straight. Overall, I think Pillars of Eternity has its flaws, but it's still a solid game. If you're a fan of CRPGs, it's definitely worth checking out. Just be prepared for a bit of a learning curve and some clunkiness along the way.
