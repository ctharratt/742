Skateboarding is a sport that has been around for decades, and it has evolved over time. From the early days of big soft wheels to the modern era of technical street skating, skateboarding has always been about pushing the limits and exploring new possibilities. As a skateboarder myself, I have seen the sport change and grow, and I have also seen the passion and dedication that skateboarders have for their craft. One of the most fundamental tricks in skateboarding is the ollie. This trick involves popping the tail of the skateboard off the ground and jumping with the board, allowing it to become airborne. The ollie is the foundation for many other tricks, and it is essential for any skateboarder to master this technique. When people ask me how the board gets in the air, I usually step off my skateboard and tell them to watch out. Then I stomp on the tail of the board. The board goes flying, usually flipping end over end a time or two. An ollie is basically this, but controlling the flight of the board once it is airborne. However, mastering the ollie is not an easy task. It requires a lot of practice and dedication to get it right. Your main thrust should be coming off of your left leg, so you get a good snap of the tail off the ground. This will get the skateboard airborne. Your right foot should then slide up the griptape and guide the board while it's in the air, keeping it under your feet. I can see that you are trying to snap the tail, but you still have most of your weight on the board via your right leg. When you jump, make sure to get your right leg up first and fast. That should help pull the board upwards as well. You really need to work on getting a good snap off of the tail though. Once you have mastered the ollie, you can move on to more advanced tricks. Skateboarding is all about progression, and there is always something new to learn. From kickflips to heelflips, from grinds to slides, there are endless possibilities for skateboarders to explore. However, it is important to remember that skateboarding is also about having fun. It is not just about landing the perfect trick or impressing others. It is about enjoying the ride and expressing yourself through your skating. One of the things that I love about skateboarding is the sense of community that it creates. Skateboarders come from all walks of life, but we all share a common passion for the sport. Whether you are skating with friends at the local park or watching videos online, there is always a sense of camaraderie among skateboarders. We support each other, push each other, and inspire each other to keep pushing the limits of what is possible on a skateboard. Another aspect of skateboarding that I find fascinating is the way that it has evolved over time. From the early days of pool skating and vert ramps to the modern era of street skating and technical tricks, skateboarding has always been about pushing the boundaries of what is possible. New tricks are invented every day, and skateboarders are constantly finding new ways to express themselves through their skating. However, with this evolution comes a certain level of risk. Skateboarding can be a dangerous sport, and injuries are not uncommon. It is important for skateboarders to take safety precautions and wear protective gear, such as helmets and pads. But even with these precautions, accidents can still happen. Skateboarding requires a certain level of commitment and bravery, and it is not for the faint of heart. Despite the risks, skateboarding remains a beloved sport for many. It is a way to express oneself, to push the limits, and to connect with others who share the same passion. Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned pro, there is always something new to learn and explore in the world of skateboarding. In conclusion, skateboarding is a sport that has captured the hearts and minds of people all over the world. From the early days of big soft wheels to the modern era of technical street skating, skateboarding has always been about pushing the limits and exploring new possibilities. Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned pro, there is always something new to learn and explore in the world of skateboarding. So grab your board, hit the streets, and enjoy the ride.
