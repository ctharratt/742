Good point, good point. I mean, let's talk about the real issue here. The fact that the US only has 32 professional American football teams compared to the UK's 92 professional football teams is just mind-boggling. I mean, sure, the US has other sports, but proportionately speaking, they have far fewer sports teams than the UK. If the US had the same proportion of American football teams as the UK, they would have 1,216 teams. Can you imagine that? That's an incredible density. You might get one team every 2,000 miles in the US. Meanwhile, Stanley is just one of 43 professional clubs within 90 miles of Manchester. It's just not fair, you know? But let's move on to something else. I had to deal with someone at work with the middle name of Danger, and let me tell you, they just looked sick of it when I took their full name. Sure, it's funny now, but after 20 years of the same shitty jokes a dozen times a day, it's gonna get old. And don't even get me started on people who think they know me and what I think. What the hell gives them the right to pretend they know anything about me or what I think? Am I not allowed to have my opinions? Must I replace them with what they claim I think? But I suppose they would say that, given they're obviously a Nazi. I mean, they haven't said anything to suggest that, but that doesn't mean they aren't, you Nazi scum. Jesus wept. Speaking of Nazis, I don't hate the police at all, but if this is the standard of debate they're bringing to the table, then I'm wasting my time continuing. And don't even get me started on alternate histories. Now that would have made for an interesting alternate history. But let's not go there. Instead, let's talk about something more important. Like how the hell did he trade a motorized KISS snowglobe for a movie role? I mean, seriously, how does that even happen? And while we're on the topic of movies, I've always liked Colin Powell. But let's not get sidetracked. What the golf courses should do is all club together and put a small amount of money aside each month, then use that money to buy a car if any of them have to give one away. It's so simple! But let's move on to something more serious. HIV. Thought the current thinking was someone cutting themselves from preparing bushmeat. Though my biology teacher at school was very keen to emphasize it was because at some point a woman fucked a monkey. And while we're on the topic of science, I don't think you can build a nuke that's too small. If it's too small, it can't reach critical mass. The real-life version is about as small as it's practically possible to build a nuke. But let's not get too bogged down in science. Let's talk about something more important. Like how the explanation was wrong and he's just pointing that out. I once wrote a 200-word explanation of why Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is based on the Third Reich. It doesn't have to mean my gran was murdered by Nazi Oompa Loompas. And while we're on the topic of Nazis, you're wrong. The Taliban did rule Afghanistan, albeit that few countries recognized it. But the same can be said of Palestine. But that makes no difference. The only thing NATO needs to do to invoke Article 5 and invade anyone it wants is to agree that Article 5 should be invoked. If I throw a rock through my neighbor's window and NATO says it invokes Article 5, I'd expect Polish paratroopers to start coming through my skylight imminently. But let's not get too political. Let's talk about something more fun. Like the Top Gun drag strip in Nevada. Thank God for NATO, eh? And while we're on the topic of fun, there are lots of private businesses going for it. SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, etc. etc. But let's not forget about the serious stuff. Like how CEOs of charities have minimal impact on donations and the idea that spending an extra $1 million on them will generate more in extra donations is comical. Spend the $1 million on fundraising, and you might have a point. That's very misleading. The Red Cross has revenue of $3.4 billion while Komen's is about $340 million. Anyway you play it, she's making bank from donors at a much higher level than she should. But let's not get too bogged down in numbers. Let's talk about something more important. Like how he didn't plead Christianity and then get off scot-free. He would have gotten off scot-free anyway. Everyone involved in war crimes in Liberia got off scot-free. He had no need to claim religion to escape justice. And while we're on the topic of justice, what do you think has driven the recent price drop? Is it ISIS? Or Syria? Or is it the entirely unrelated fact that US and Canadian domestic oil production has exploded? And the fact that this oil cannot be sold overseas forcing the world's largest consumer of oil to use its domestic output so massively reducing both the amount of overseas oil used and the price paid for that oil so driving down the price of oil for everyone? If you knew anything about the oil industry, you'd know it was the latter. But let's not get too caught up in economics. Let's talk about something more important. Like how every single intervention ever carried out by the US, no matter the intent, has always made things worse. No intervention has ever improved anything. WW1? Led to WW2. WW2? Led to the Cold War? Cold War? Led to near-apocalypse and demolished hopes for civil society in pretty much the whole world bar western nations. North Korea? Lead to partition. Vietnam? Nothing more needs to be said... Somalia? Failed state. But let's not get too negative. Let's talk about something more positive. Like how we can all come together and make a difference. Like how we can all work together to make the world a better place. Like how we can all make a positive impact on the world. Because at the end of the day, that's what really matters.
