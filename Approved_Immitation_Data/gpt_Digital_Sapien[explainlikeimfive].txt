Alright, let's get one thing straight here. If you're going to insult people, you better be ready to take the heat that comes with it. Don't be a pussy and cry about it when someone calls you out on your BS. And don't try to make excuses for not answering someone's clear and cogent thoughts. If you have nothing to back yourself up, then just admit it and move on. Now, let's talk about this whole conspiracy theory nonsense. I don't know where you're getting your information from, but most of what you're talking about has a tone of conspiracy theory. I mean, come on, do you really think there's some secret cabal that knows about aliens and withholds that information from the President? That's just ridiculous. And don't even get me started on Benghazi. The fact that you're more upset about an attack on foreign soil that claimed 4 lives than you are about a domestic attack that claimed more than 3000 is just mind-boggling to me. I mean, seriously, why is that? And don't try to blame it on some anti-Muslim propaganda. The CIA and the Libyan government say it was planned premeditated attacks and had nothing to do with a video. The only people that ever mentioned the video were the White House. And let's not forget about Obamacare. Say what you want about it, but remember that most of Europe already has free state healthcare. Typically, this means European countries respect the US more because we see free healthcare as a staple of society. We like Obama for bringing the US up to scratch. And don't even get me started on this whole ultra-patriotic crap. The assumption that America rules the entire world is just ridiculous. We take the piss when people like you act arrogant and think the rest of the world is irrelevant. So cut it out and quit making your country look bad. Now, I know some of you might be thinking that the President has access to everything, all the time. But that's just not true. It's literally impossible for him to be conveyed everything in full as there are not enough hours in the day. And there's no secret cabal that knows about everything and decides who gets what information. That's just something you see in movies. And let's not forget about the fact that the current administration watched as 4 Americans died on foreign soil during a time of elevated regional unrest. That's just unacceptable. And the fact that they did nothing and sent no help is just cowardly. But I guess some people just can't see the truth. They're too blinded by their own biases and prejudices to see what's really going on. And that's just sad. So, in conclusion, don't be a pussy and insult people if you're not willing to take the heat. And don't believe everything you hear about conspiracy theories and secret cabals. And most importantly, don't forget about the truth.
