Hey there, folks. Back at it again with some thoughts on a few different topics. First off, I want to say that it's a real shame to hear about some people ruining the Secret Santa experience for others. It's always been one of my favorite things to participate in, and it's disheartening to hear that some folks have had negative experiences. I stopped doing them myself a while ago for similar reasons, but I always appreciated the genuine thought and effort that went into the gifts and participation of others. And props to anyone who's still out there doing it and keeping the spirit alive. Speaking of gift giving, I recently got a Pebble Time Round as a gift for Christmas, and I have to say, I'm pretty impressed with it. I've never been much of a watch person, but this one is the perfect size and has some really cool features. It tracks my steps and sleep, which is especially helpful for me since I struggle with insomnia. And the watchie-talkie app is a lifesaver for quick communication with my husband. The only downside is that there aren't as many available apps as some of the other Pebble models yet, but I'm sure that will change in time. Overall, I'm loving the convenience and usability of the whole thing. Now, I know some people might be hesitant to try out a smartwatch because of the size and bulkiness, but trust me when I say that the Pebble Time Round is the perfect size. I've tried on some other models in stores, and they were just too thick for my liking. But this one is sleek and stylish, and I hardly even notice it's there. So if you're on the fence about getting a smartwatch, I highly recommend giving this one a try. Switching gears a bit, I want to talk about a funny (and slightly embarrassing) story involving some special brownies. Last year, I had a bridesmaids weekend party at my place, and one of my bridesmaids, who happens to be a big pothead, asked if she could bring her vaporizer. Unfortunately, I'm allergic to pot, so I had to tell her no. But she came up with a compromise and made some brownies instead. Long story short, one of my bridesmaids ended up getting a little too high and thought we were trying to kill her. It was a bit of a wild ride, but we all had a good laugh about it afterwards. And finally, I just want to say that it's always nice to receive compliments, even if they're from a computer program. I recently got sick and my smartwatch was reminding me to get enough sleep for a healthier lifestyle. It was a little mocking, given how sick I was feeling, but it's still nice to know that someone (or something) out there cares about my well-being. And on that note, I hope you all take care of yourselves and have a great day.
