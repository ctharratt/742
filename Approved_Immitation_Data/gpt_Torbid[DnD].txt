Personally, I have to say that Alert is one of the most amazing feats in D&D, not just because of the bonus to Initiative, but because of the other factors that come with it, such as avoiding sneak attacks. When you think about it, the only real value of Initiative is that you might get to take your turn before the bad guys do. While that can be helpful in fast combats, in longer ones it doesn't really matter on its own. The bigger issue, in my opinion, is that a d20 roll is so variable that it can easily overwhelm most Initiative rolls. When a single roll decides something for the entire combat, a +4 doesn't make a significant difference. However, with Alert, you have the added benefit of avoiding sneak attacks, which can be a real game-changer. In our games, we use the Donjon initiative tracker, which means that everyone rolls initiative after finishing their actions, and then we hit the sort button when the round is done. It only adds about 5-10 seconds to a turn at most, and it's actually a lot of fun because you never know if the enemy will go again before the team can make a counterattack. Sometimes you go twice before their actions, and it feels like a total badass. The general lack of certainty is what makes it great though, because you can't just rely on the cleric to heal you before the enemy's next attack. You have to be on your toes and ready to react to anything that comes your way. I have to disagree with the idea that tactical combat is about reducing variability. In my opinion, it's more about maximizing offensive and defensive capability from moment to moment in creative ways. Increased situational variance actually makes that more predictable, because you have to be ready for anything and everything. That's what makes D&D so much fun – the fact that each round is so variable, and the battle can swing back and forth chaotically. When it comes to planning a campaign, I think it's important to have a set of plot lines you want to focus on, and a general path for the campaign – whether it's local heroes defending a city, the king being assassinated, war with another country, a powerful dragon being awakened, or something else entirely. However, you also need to leave things flexible and not decide the specifics of the adventures until they're coming up. Organically coming up with plot twists is actually much better, because you can react to player actions and the expectations they build over time. Plus, what are you going to do if they try something that is fun and makes sense but you haven't accounted for? You have to be ready to improvise and adapt on the fly. When it comes to undead, I think it's best to just heal them up before they die. While re-summoning undead is significantly more difficult than just keeping control, it's still possible. If 5e has no method of healing undead, then it's edition-wide, and house rules will probably be used. So far, however, the idea that undead can use hit die to rest seems like a good bet. The problem is that while earlier editions worked that way, the rules explicitly work differently in 5e, presumably for balance reasons. It's something that needs to be addressed on a case-by-case basis, depending on the specific circumstances of the game. When it comes to ending a campaign, I think it's important to end on a climactic high note, with the players finally overcoming the great challenge that is your campaign's capstone. Some players may die, but that's okay. Then, narrate the short-term events after the big climax. The city rebuilds, the players are lauded as heroes, the fallen have statues erected in their honor, and so on. Next, ask the players what they want to do in their "retirement" – whether it's running an inn, ruling as mayor, being a wandering badass, or something else entirely. Have each player make a personal decision to wrap up their character, and be very lenient with what they can achieve (they won, after all). Finally, describe the long-term future of your world, including their impacts heavily. Make a story of the ending and have narrative fun. When it comes to creating enemies, I think it's important to make them as intelligent as possible. This means having them utilize resources that are not in their stat block, such as laying traps or burrowing, and then bursting out in unison for an ambush at tactical locations. If they lose the upper hand, they should retreat and stay just out of player sight/range as reinforcements slowly come up. Imagine a slowly growing horde of snarling wolves, just out of torch range, hiding behind trees. This basically gives the party 3-4 rounds of reprieve while they witness a bigger fight build up. REALLY play up their intelligence – have them construct shoddy but effective bunkers/spike walls, draw maps in the ground with their paws as they plan new attacks, and so on. Ultimately, I think it works best if the wolves defend a 3-5 mile stretch of territory that the players need to fight their way through. It keeps the wolves in a "wolf-like" environment that also allows them to take advantage of their mobility and have a believably unlimited number of them continually reinforcing the pack. In conclusion, there are a lot of different strategies and approaches to playing and running a D&D campaign. What's important is to find what works best for you and your group, and to be willing to adapt and change as needed. With the right mindset and a little bit of creativity, you can create amazing stories and experiences that will keep you coming back to the table again and again.
