Dude, I'm not sure why everyone is so against secession. I mean, sure it's a big decision, but why not? Texas is a pretty self-sufficient state. We have a strong economy, we attract a lot of immigrants, and our population is projected to double by 2050. We could probably manage on our own. But then again, maybe I'm just being naive. I mean, there are a lot of factors to consider. What about our relationship with the rest of the country? Would we still be able to trade with them? Would we have to establish our own currency? And what about national defense? Would we have to create our own military? I guess what I'm saying is that secession is a big decision that shouldn't be taken lightly. But at the same time, I don't think it's something we should completely dismiss. We should at least consider the possibility and weigh the pros and cons. And speaking of weighing pros and cons, let's talk about Bernie Sanders. I know a lot of people are really passionate about him, but I'm just not convinced. I mean, sure, he talks a good game about grassroots movements and sticking it to the establishment, but what are his actual policies? And more importantly, how is he going to pay for them? I've heard a lot of people say that we could just cut the military budget and tax the top 5% to pay for Sanders' proposals, but I'm not so sure. Even if we did that, would it be enough? Sanders' plans are so expensive that I'm not sure any amount of cutting and taxing could cover them. And let's not forget about the potential consequences of Sanders' policies. I mean, sure, free college and healthcare for all sounds great, but what about the unintended consequences? Would it lead to higher taxes and a weaker economy? Would it discourage innovation and entrepreneurship? I'm not saying that Sanders is a bad guy or that his heart isn't in the right place. I just think we need to be realistic about what his policies would actually mean for our country. And while we're on the topic of politics, let's talk about the Confederate flag. I know a lot of people are really passionate about it, but I just don't see what the big deal is. I mean, sure, it's a symbol of the Confederacy and all that it stood for, but does that really matter? I think we need to remember that the Confederate flag means different things to different people. For some, it's a symbol of heritage and pride. For others, it's a symbol of hate and oppression. But at the end of the day, it's just a piece of cloth. I don't think we should ban the Confederate flag or anything like that. I think we should just let people decide for themselves whether or not they want to display it. If someone wants to fly the Confederate flag on their property, that's their right. And if someone else doesn't like it, they can just look the other way. I know this might not be a popular opinion, but I think it's important to remember that we live in a country that values freedom and individual rights. And that includes the right to display whatever flag you want, whether it's the American flag, the Confederate flag, or something else entirely. Anyway, those are just my thoughts on a few different topics. I know I can ramble on sometimes, but I hope you found some of what I said interesting or thought-provoking. And if not, well, that's okay too. We're all entitled to our own opinions.
