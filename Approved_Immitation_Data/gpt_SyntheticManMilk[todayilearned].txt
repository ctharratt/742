This is the kind of shit that really grinds my gears. How do people listen to this garbage and actually enjoy it? I've been hating on this stuff for decades now and it still baffles me. It's like people have no taste or standards anymore. I remember one time my mom dated this guy who was kind of a weenie, but a nice dude. He was like a less manly, law-abiding version of Hank Hill from King of the Hill. Anyways, where we live, the public school recreational facilities are open to the public during non-school hours. That means you can use the fields, tennis courts, and whatnot. So one afternoon, after school hours, this guy was using the local high school track field to run laps. But he had to piss really bad and there were no restrooms around. So he went behind a dumpster where he could piss in private. Well, some student who was there for some after-school reason saw him and freaked out. They told on him and the cops came and arrested him. After long and expensive legal proceedings, he narrowly avoided being labeled as a registered sex offender. Can you believe that shit? All because some prude saw him taking a piss behind a dumpster. It's ridiculous. But you know what really grinds my gears? The fact that there's so much stupid shit out there that can kill you. It's like you can't even trust the air you breathe these days. And don't even get me started on the whole hand-washing thing. Back then, doctors were considered gentlemen and it was believed that a gentleman didn't need to wash his hands because he was already clean. Can you believe that shit? And then there's all this folklore and tradition that people believe in. Like in Vietnamese culture, it's really important for the dead to have a proper burial. If they don't, their spirit will wander in a Limbo-like state. And if you get blown up in the jungle fighting GI, you probably won't have a proper burial. But you know what's even crazier? The fact that this one guy drove some Japs off a cliff and got away with it. I mean, I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but it's just crazy to think about. And then there's all this stuff about curses and gypsies. Like, if someone curses you, you're supposed to find a gypsy to help you out. I mean, I don't know if that's true or not, but it's just interesting to think about. But you know what really grinds my gears? People who curse others just because they won't go out with them. Like, what the hell? That's not how you get a date, buddy. You should try being a decent human being instead of a dick. And then there's all this talk about food. I'll eat anything, really. I'm not picky. But I do draw the line at putting peanuts on someone's salad if they have an allergy. That's just messed up. And then there's all this talk about music. I mean, I like what I like and I dislike what I dislike. I don't care if it's popular or not. But some of the stuff on the radio these days is just garbage. Poorly done synth effects and clicks with no rhyme or reason, and lyrics that are just short sentences that a 4-year-old could come up with. It's insulting to both art and music. But you know what really grinds my gears? People who are afraid to leave their doors unlocked at night. I mean, I'm sitting in my living room right now with my front door unlocked and I don't care because nothing is going to happen. It's sad that some people are so paranoid that they can't even do what I'm doing right now. And then there's all this talk about movies. I remember this one movie that was screened in LA for a short time. My guess is that all the money was made through VHS sales. I mean, I remember the commercial for it, but I never actually saw the movie. The baseball player knocking the head off the old lady in the wheelchair with a bat kind of disturbed me as a young man watching the commercial. But you know what really grinds my gears? People who judge others based on where they live. Just because someone lives in Detroit doesn't mean they're automatically a criminal. And just because someone lives in a low-crime area doesn't mean they shouldn't lock their doors when they're home. Overall, there's just so much shit out there that grinds my gears. But you know what really grinds my gears? People who don't have any common sense or decency. It's like they're just trying to piss me off.
