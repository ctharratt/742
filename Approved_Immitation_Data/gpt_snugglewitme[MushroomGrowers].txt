Hey there fellow mycology enthusiasts! I hope everyone is doing well and having success with their grows. I wanted to give an update on my latest grow using the WBS spawn method. First off, I have to say that I have been feeling under the weather lately. I've been experiencing a lot of sneezing, an itchy throat, coughing, and a stuffy head. I don't feel very achy, but I have been getting headaches from all the coughing and sneezing. I'm not sure if it's allergies or a cold, but either way, it's been making things a bit more difficult. Despite feeling sick, I have been able to continue with my grow. I used a 3:1 cocoa coir substrate to spawn ratio, using a half of a small brick of coco coir and about a cup of coffee grounds with a teaspoon of calcium chloride (pickling lime). I mixed it all up in a 5-gallon bucket, poured 11 cups of boiling water on top, put the lid on, waited 10 minutes, opened it, stirred it around, and resealed it. I waited about an hour for it to cool before putting 3 quarts, about 5 big spoonfuls of the substrate in a tub, lined with a black trash bag that was previously rubbed down with ISO alcohol and 2 of my pint jars (1 quart of WBS inoculated spawn) into the 6-quart tubs. I mixed it all up, covered it with aluminum foil, poked 4 holes for ventilation, and covered it with micro pore tape. I've been growing mine in a giant styrofoam cooler I found at work, that they were throwing away. It's sitting in the dining room in the corner with a heating mat/thermostat in it. I have to say, it's been working pretty well so far. One thing I did notice was some weird yellowy splotches on the bottom left of the tub. Other than that, it looks nice. I'm not sure if it's a contamination or just a weird discoloration, but I'll keep an eye on it. I did have a fever last night, so I'm pretty sure I'm just dealing with a cold or something more sinister. If I were allergic, I would think the symptoms would dissipate at work, but I feel the same way while at work, so it's definitely a sickness. I sterilized 8 jars, noc'd up 6 jars with just a general mushroom spore syringe, and am using the other 2 as control jars, just to make sure I did everything correctly up until I noc'd them up. I'm still pretty new to this, so I want to make sure I'm doing everything right. As of day 5, those control jars look contamination-free, which is good. I've heard that G2G is really tricky and you need to have a glovebox or flowhood or something and be even more sterile than with a spore syringe. I'm not sure if that's true or not, but I'm sticking with the spore syringe for now. I actually liked the process of making the lids, it was fun. I used the normal typical lid, with the tyvek filter, silicone, and the 1/4" hole, and I just have that all covered with foil. I'm not sure if I should take the foil off or not, but I'm leaving it on for now. Thanks to everyone who has been giving me advice and answering my questions. I really appreciate it. I've been trying to follow the TEK (technique) to the letter, and it's been working pretty well so far. I just know the temperature in my house fluctuates quite a bit, so I decided to make sure I limit any variables in case my 'experiment' goes bad. I even have 2 jars that are labeled as 'control' just to see if they get contaminated with anything. I'm not sure if I should leave the foil on after PCing, so I did. I inoculated 4 different points in the jar and am using WBS. I feel like I'm actually kinda getting the hang of this thing. I seem to be doing all these sterilization steps and prep steps very smoothly without having to look back at the teks or anything. It's kinda nice. I feel like I'm learning, which is awesome. At a Walmart near me, I found a decent-sized pressure cooker for like $30. I didn't buy it because I was able to borrow an electric PC'er with a timer from a relative. She got it for $130 and only holds 4 pint jars at a time, so I have to do multiple sterilizations, but it's super nice. I just have to set it and let it do its thing. Also, make sure you buy wide-mouth jars. It might just be personal preference, but I find them to be easier to work with, plus if you need to clean out your jars, it makes them much easier to clean out. When you're following a certain TEK, you should follow it to the letter. If it says PC for 90 minutes, do it, no longer, no less. If it says to soak the birdseed for an hour, don't do it for 2 hours. Etc. I'm planning on starting to grow some type of mushrooms, and I was thinking of trying oyster mushrooms. I've been researching a lot of what I'll need and such, but I'm kinda scared I'll mess it up. I think these look super awesome and would like to try them out. I've been incubating my jars using a big styrofoam cooler I found at work and putting my jars in shoe boxes and placing those shoe boxes on top of a heat mat inside the cooler. Is 79 degrees an okay temperature to keep them at? I've read that the inside of jars is usually warmer because of the growing process. I've also had extra spores, so I'm trying to make a jar of liquid culture using 300ml of distilled water and 1 tablespoon of Karo. I've been incubating that for a few days now, but I was just wondering, how do I know when I can quit incubating and the liquid culture jar is done growing? I do kinda see the spores at the top of the water are sorta growing, I guess. Will the top of the water be completely overgrown with mycelium? Soooo, after my jars are 100% done and I'm ready to start fruiting them, do I need to dunk the cakes in water for 24 hours and roll them in a casing before trying to fruit them, or do I just take the cakes out of the jars and put them in a fruiting chamber? I'm sure I have more questions, but those are the only ones I can think of for now. Thanks again to everyone who has been helping me out. I really appreciate it. Happy growing!
