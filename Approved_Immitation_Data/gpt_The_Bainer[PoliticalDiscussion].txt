I've been thinking a lot about GMOs lately and I just don't understand the argument against them. There has been absolutely no evidence of any harmful effects and with a global population of over 7 billion, we need to do something to keep everyone fed. It's just common sense. I think people are too quick to jump on the anti-GMO bandwagon without really understanding the science behind it.  On the topic of isolationism/non-interventionism, I firmly believe that the US has a responsibility to intervene when we see atrocities being committed in other countries. I'm a big supporter of Obama, but I was extremely disappointed when we did nothing after Assad gassed his own people. I hope that he will still be held accountable for his actions. And the idea that we should abandon the Afghan people after all we did to trash that country in the 80s is absurd to me. We have a responsibility to help rebuild and support them.  When it comes to trade, I am very much pro-trade. Of course, there should be clauses in the deals for workers' rights and the environment, but just because a country has a lower cost of living doesn't mean people live in slave-like conditions. It happens far too often, but more often than not, trade deals provide legal mechanisms to go after people with abhorrent working conditions than would otherwise exist.  I'm sure there are other topics I could discuss, but those are the ones that come to mind first. I've been a die-hard supporter of Obama since he first announced his candidacy. I was only 17 at the time, but I signed up the day his campaign site launched and started organizing for him in my community. I was still 17 when the primary rolled around, but I worked hard so that I could vote for him in the general election.  This time around, I'm 100% behind Hillary. I had a deep respect for her in 2008 and I still do now. Even more, I am proud of the work she did for the President as Secretary of State and proud of the way she supports him on the trail. Of course, it also depends on the state. Far-left voters in states like California, Oregon, or Vermont might be more inclined to throw their votes towards a protest candidate, but that won't have much of an effect on the overall outcome for those states. Far-left voters in states like Ohio or Florida, which are swing states that have been under Republican control, might hesitate to throw their votes away. Those voters might be more inclined to suck it up and vote for Hillary rather than risk throwing the election away.  I think another important group to consider is Libertarians. Trump would be a very anti-libertarian nominee for the Republicans. For example, his ardent defense of the use of imminent domain smacks in the face of everything libertarians stand for. I think they might be the most willing of any group to make a vote on their principles rather than try to vote strategically. That could be important in states like Nevada, Arizona, and Colorado. If a lot of libertarians jump over to Gary Johnson, Trump will have a rougher time in those states.  Now, I know some people have drawn similarities between Trump and Sanders, but I don't think they're quite the same. Trump rode a wave of populist anti-establishmentism and was bombastic and aggressive in attacking his opponents. He also made it a focus of his campaign to take on big banks and fought for tariffs to shut down foreign imports. And most significantly, he vilified a minority group that his base thought was a threat to the country. In contrast, Sanders focused on income inequality and the influence of big money in politics.  One change I would like to see is an amendment to Article 4 Section 4 of the Constitution. The United States should guarantee to every state in this Union a Republican Democratic form of government and an explicit, unbridgeable guarantee of the right of US citizens to vote. I also think there should be clarification of the process by which states may call and convene a constitutional convention.  I believe that increasing the size of the House and decreasing the ratio of people to representative would have many benefits. First, it would reduce the influence of money in politics. This may seem counterintuitive, since at first you may think 'well more politicians just means more people who can be bought.' But having more representatives would mean that those who use money to influence elections would have to spend a whole lot more money to influence enough elections to actually influence the result. This would substantially increase the transaction costs of trying to spend your way towards getting a majority in the House.  Not only would there be more races to spend money on, but people like the Kochs or if you prefer the Bloombergs of the world would also have to spend a lot more time and money actually finding people to run in all of these races. These increased transaction costs for out-of-district elites would also be countered by reduced transaction costs for those who actually live in the district. More representatives means fewer people per representative. This inevitably means that an individual voter in that district has the ability to wield a greater voice in that district.  Overall, I think these are important issues that need to be addressed. We need to be smart about our use of GMOs, we need to intervene when atrocities are being committed, and we need to support fair trade deals. We also need to make sure that everyone has the right to vote and that our government is truly representative of the people.
