Alright, let's talk about Game of Thrones. Specifically, let's talk about some of the theories and opinions floating around out there. There are a lot of them, so I'll try to cover as many as I can. First up, the idea that Jorah Mormont will end up with Longclaw. This one actually makes a lot of sense to me. Jeor Mormont gave the sword to Jon Snow, but with Jon now dead (or at least, seemingly dead), the sword is up for grabs. Jorah is Jeor's son, and he's been trying to win back his father's favor for a long time. It would be fitting for him to end up with Longclaw, especially if he ends up sacrificing himself to save Daenerys or someone else. Next, the theory that Davos will kill Stannis. This one seems pretty likely to me as well. Davos has always been one of the more honorable characters on the show, and he's shown a willingness to stand up to Stannis in the past. If he finds out about Shireen's death, I could definitely see him turning on Stannis and taking him out. Then there's the idea that Brienne could beat Jaime in a fight to the death. This one is a bit more controversial, but I actually think it's possible. Jaime has always been a bit overconfident, and Brienne has proven herself to be an incredibly skilled fighter. Plus, Jaime himself admits that Brienne is stronger than him. If they were fighting to the death, I could see Brienne finding a way to win. Moving on to some more out-there theories, there's the idea that Walder Frey could end up being a major player in the endgame. This one seems unlikely to me, but it's not impossible. Walder Frey is a pretty despicable character, but he's also proven himself to be a shrewd politician. If he were to team up with someone like Littlefinger or Varys, he could end up being a major player in the game of thrones. Then there's the theory that the White Walkers will actually turn out to be the good guys. This one is definitely a long shot, but it's an interesting idea. We don't know much about the White Walkers' motivations, so it's possible that they're not just mindless killing machines. Maybe they have a reason for wanting to wipe out humanity. It's a stretch, but it's not impossible. Finally, there's the idea that Daenerys will end up ruling from Essos while someone else takes the Iron Throne. This one actually seems pretty likely to me. Daenerys has always been more interested in freeing slaves and ruling justly than she has been in playing the game of thrones. If someone like Davos were to take the Iron Throne, I could see Daenerys being content to rule from across the sea. Of course, these are all just theories and opinions. We won't know for sure what's going to happen until the show actually airs. But that's part of the fun of Game of Thrones - speculating about what might happen next.
