This story is gonna be so juicy when we finally hear it. Betting on which team? Obviously Washington is favored, but where is it indicated in that number? Simply sensational! Not really accurate. What exactly does that mean? I think that we can take the nsfw for granted. Disconnect the phones, do this You do that, and, you know, you go to the jail, you know, two hours by yourself, you feel shame, you know. And then you get released. That's part of why I hope we don't go for someone like Ladd or another bottom-6 forward. They shouldn't push a guy like Latta to permanent nacho duty. He's played hard, he's played fairly well, and he's earned his playing time. He can take some games to let players like Alzner, Niskanen, and Schmidt get a night off. Didn't the ARI player poke it out? They most likely deceived him. I can speak Russian well enough to confirm that his translation gets the prescient information. No, it doesn't. It means he gets to take a trip to Finland or Germany. So does it mean that Kovy can come back to the league without the consent of all teams? And on that day, San Jose fans will be wondering where the hell their second round pick went, and then they might think of your post, and it will be kinda neat. Which goes to show how incredible the other guys have been. Yeah, the dude is probably one of the top 10 players in the world. I couldn't believe he'd be up for a trade. Eh, Slava himself had a good bit to do with that. The season is an abject failure if they don't make it at least to the Conference Finals. Teams and players have been going out of their ways to make (mostly male) gay folks feel welcome in the game, and have rightly received a lot of praise for doing so. And they've been doing this not by selling 'gay hockey,' but by simply recognizing that there are gay hockey fans and that they are welcome as fans as players in the sport. It strikes me that reaching out to female fans with the same tone would be the right thing to do. Recognize that there are female fans, make clear that the league is happy to have them as fans and players of the sport, and that anyone who has a problem with that (or who tries to make women feel unwelcome as fans or players) isn't in line with the league. Nothing stupid about it. Thanks for putting in so much thought. Henrik Lindquist is really, really good-looking. Gabby has gotten to Game 7 of the Conference Finals. That's more than most coaches can say in this league. I mean, unless opponents try to adapt to that tactic or something... (They do.) You know that Jagr won Cups with the Pens, right? Way back in the first Road to the NHL Winter Classic, when Washington was getting walloped by the Rags, Ovie was kinda protesting a double minor to their player who drew blood on a high stick. "He must have sensitive skin." Everyone else has their hockey caps on. What the fuck is he doing with an LA Lakers hat? Not that, you know, I mind or anything, Dustin... Yo, why does Buffalo keep wearing its white jerseys at home? So I'm kinda confused. They blocked people from watching the Isles game on their phones while the Isles were playing on the ice in front of them? That gif is getting reused. Were they all injured? Benched? Nobody asked you to pass the salt. Well, Saturday is gonna be fun. Ovie just scored a hat trick! And the game's pretty exciting, too. Japers' Rink, the Washington Capitals SB Nation blog, has a series called 'Moments that Mattered,' in which they take a significant play in a Caps game and explain why it was crucial in the game, why it resulted as it did, and what it shows about the team. It includes gifs, videos, and illustrations, and is altogether really good. Take a look at it. Is he perchance right-handed? I'd love to hear you elaborate on that. No, Semin scoring the OT winner in Game 1. Is that really her? To the tune of the Nationwide Jingle: Guess a win is still a win. This is like a high school game. Jesus. This has to be the worst offensive performance in a Superbowl since XL. They also had to let Beyonce and Bruno Mars take over, and those folks can actually dance. Women are the overwhelming majority of the victims of domestic violence. Superbowl Halftime Shows shouldn't be played in daylight. A metric which quantifies the balance of shot attempts. It's like plus/minus, but for shot attempts. It helps to show which team is controlling possession. Quick delivery of oxygen. Those words must have been really beyond the pale. Because I don't think he's made a shootout attempt or a penalty shot since this time last season. I mean, when I was watching, it looked like Ovie was practically just laying down for a nap after a 1:00+ shift and was just using this poor schmuck as a cushion. Stupid question: where's the crosscheck to the head? *Edit: Think I saw it on the other vid. And we have a hockey game! The worst hockey player in the NHL got voted to the All Star Game. The NHL were giant douchecanoes about it. In what was essentially a storybook ending, John Scott came out a winner. So we're counting out an Alex Semin comeback? Suggestion: Upvotes turned to upscotts, downvotes turned to Bettmans. The top of this sub right now They pretended to fight! We won, guys! We've gotten one game in the last 2 weeks in Washington. You know nothing. First he gotta find me Although that won't be difficult, considering my height. Did Milbury actually say that? Wow, he actually put that in! Looked legit to me. This just in: It's a cold day in hell, and the CBC feed is worse than NBCSN's. Holts came to play! They're almost done with the foreplay. So was that dude on the guitar holding that stance for 15 minutes straight? Wait, both teams have white jerseys? Oh, how excited they look Thank heavens for small favors. East. They earned the choice by winning the skills competition last night. Once they finish the foreplay. Is Larkin the only one doing the skate around the rink? If I were Ovie, I would tell Nastya to pack her bags and fly somewhere nice for the long weekend. Fluffier than an ungroomed poodle. The Caps and Panthers had a game last year where they exhausted all the shooters. They permitted the teams to pick players once more. This was the first time this happened in an NHL game. Must have brought a whole bunch of coke cans, eh? There's actually a woman named Fujimoto in the NWHL? If you know the history behind that name in hockey, you'll know that it's kinda hilarious. It's more money than I would have expected for a player with so many restricted years left. I'm confused. Doesn't he have a bunch more years before he becomes an RFA? Thankyouforyourservicethankyouforyourservice Do Canadians do any of this sort of thing? I'm really tired of these. Reunions should be private family moments, not put on for gawking crowd to give them patriotic chubbers. I'm just kinda amused that he's wearing an American flag get-up while talking about this. Who are we talking about? I've forgotten. Gay men can't watch a hockey game without having hetero sexuality thrown in their faces. Hockey is a sport that has been around for centuries, and it has always been a sport that has been loved by many. However, it has not always been a sport that has been welcoming to everyone. In recent years, there has been a push to make hockey more inclusive, and this has been a great thing for the sport. Teams and players have been going out of their ways to make (mostly male) gay folks feel welcome in the game, and have rightly received a lot of praise for doing so. And they've been doing this not by selling 'gay hockey,' but by simply recognizing that there are gay hockey fans and that they are welcome as fans as players in the sport. It strikes me that reaching out to female fans with the same tone would be the right thing to do. Recognize that there are female fans, make clear that the league is happy to have them as fans and players of the sport, and that anyone who has a problem with that (or who tries to make women feel unwelcome as fans or players) isn't in line with the league. This is a great step forward for the sport, and it is something that should be celebrated. However, there is still work to be done. Women are still underrepresented in the sport, both as fans and as players. This is something that needs to change, and it is something that the league needs to address. One way that the league can address this is by reaching out to female fans and making them feel welcome. This can be done by creating more female-friendly events, such as women's hockey clinics or women's hockey games. It can also be done by creating more female-friendly merchandise, such as jerseys that are designed for women. Another way that the league can address this is by creating more opportunities for women to play the sport. This can be done by
