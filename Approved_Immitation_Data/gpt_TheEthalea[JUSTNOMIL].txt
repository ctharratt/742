I can't believe some of the shit I read on these forums. Like seriously, what is wrong with people? I mean, I get it, we all have our own problems and issues, but some of these mother-in-laws are just next level crazy. Like, I'd be scared to even be in the same room as them. Take this one woman, for example. She's got a mother-in-law who's basically on her deathbed, but instead of being grateful for the care she's receiving, she's just making everyone's lives a living hell. She's choking on her food, falling over all the time, and generally just being a pain in the ass. And yet, this poor woman and her husband are expected to take care of her 24/7? That's just insane. I mean, I get it, she's family and all that, but there comes a point where you have to draw the line. You can't just sacrifice your own well-being for someone else's, especially when they're not even appreciative of what you're doing for them. And the fact that the mother-in-law is trying to insert herself into their marriage? That's just messed up. I don't know how these people do it. I mean, I love my own mother-in-law, but if she ever tried to pull some of the shit I read about on these forums, I'd be out of there faster than you can say "crazy MIL". It's just not worth the stress and drama. And don't even get me started on the ones who try to control everything. Like, seriously, who do they think they are? It's not their life, it's not their marriage, and it's definitely not their kids. And yet, they act like they have some kind of ownership over everything. I mean, I get it, they want to be involved and all that, but there's a difference between being involved and being overbearing. And some of these MILs are definitely in the latter category. They want to control everything from what you eat to what you wear to how you raise your kids. It's just ridiculous. And the worst part is, some of these husbands just let it happen. They don't stand up for their wives, they don't set boundaries, they just let their mothers walk all over them. It's like they're still little boys who can't stand up to their mommy. I mean, I get it, family is important and all that, but there comes a point where you have to put your foot down. You have to stand up for yourself and your spouse, and make it clear that you're not going to tolerate any more bullshit. It's not easy, but it's necessary. And don't even get me started on the ones who try to buy their way into their grandkids' lives. Like, seriously, what kind of person does that? You can't just throw money at a problem and expect it to go away. You have to actually put in the effort and build a relationship. And yet, some of these MILs think that they can just buy their grandkids' love. They shower them with gifts and money, but they don't actually spend any time with them or get to know them as people. It's just sad. I mean, I get it, being a grandparent is awesome and all that, but you have to earn that title. You can't just expect it to be handed to you on a silver platter. You have to actually put in the work and build a relationship with your grandkids. And the worst part is, some of these MILs don't even realize what they're doing wrong. They think that they're being helpful or generous, but in reality, they're just causing more problems. It's like they're living in their own little world where they're the hero and everyone else is just a supporting character. I don't know how these people do it. I mean, I love my own mother-in-law, but if she ever tried to pull some of the shit I read about on these forums, I'd be out of there faster than you can say "crazy MIL". It's just not worth the stress and drama. And yet, some of these women just keep putting up with it. They keep trying to make things work, even when it's clear that they're fighting a losing battle. It's like they're trying to prove something to themselves or to their MILs, but in reality, they're just hurting themselves. I don't know what the solution is. Maybe it's setting boundaries, maybe it's cutting ties, maybe it's just learning to let go. But whatever it is, these women need to do something. They can't just keep living in this cycle of stress and drama. They deserve better than that. In the end, I guess it all comes down to one thing: respect. If these MILs could just learn to respect their daughters-in-law and their boundaries, a lot of these problems could be avoided. But until that happens, we're going to keep seeing these horror stories on these forums. And that's just sad.
