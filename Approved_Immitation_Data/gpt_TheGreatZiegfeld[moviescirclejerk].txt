Oh man, where do I even begin? Satantango is one of those films that just sticks with you, you know? It's like this obscure gem that only a select few have seen, and I feel so lucky to be one of them. But it's weird, because I hardly ever hear anyone talking about it. Like, seriously, I've only had like five people ever bring it up to me in the past three years. And that's just crazy to me, because it's such a masterpiece. But you know what's even crazier? The fact that I was actually in the theater when the film premiered in 1895. Yeah, you read that right. I'm basically a time traveler. And let me tell you, that premiere was insane. The train scene killed three people in the theater, and I barely managed to get out of the way in time. It was like something out of a horror movie. And to make matters worse, there were crying children in the front row. Like, come on, if you can't control your kids, don't bring them to the theater. And if your child is covered in blood, for god's sake, remove them from the premises. But you know what's even weirder than all of that? The fact that I go to the theaters alone. Yeah, you heard me. Alone. And you know why? Because it keeps the body count from rising. I mean, have you seen some of the people who go to the movies these days? It's like they've never heard of personal hygiene or basic manners. And don't even get me started on the crying babies. Ugh. Anyway, back to Satantango. It's just such an eclectic film, you know? And I love that about it. It's like nothing else out there. And don't even get me started on Abel Gance's Napoleon. That film used to last a long time, but now it lasts a long time. And it's a shame, because I used that as a pick-up line once and some asshole interrupted me with a reference to Berlin Alexanderplatz. Like, come on, man, can't you see I'm trying to impress someone here? But you know what really grinds my gears? When people act like Hollywood is actually listening to us. Like, come on, guys, we're not that important. And sure, I'm all for R-rated blockbusters, but let's not act like we're the ones making the decisions here. And let's be real, Deadpool was good, but it wasn't exactly groundbreaking. I'm still waiting for the first R-rated blockbuster that actually utilizes the rating in a natural way. Kingsman was okay, but it wasn't anything special. And can we talk about memes for a second? I mean, I love a good meme as much as the next guy, but sometimes it feels like we're just trying too hard. Like, we're trying to prove how cool and hip we are by referencing obscure films and directors. And don't even get me started on the whole Gance History Month thing. It's just disrespectful and childish. But you know what's not disrespectful and childish? Pasolini. That man was a genius. And Godard? Kurosawa? Don't even get me started. And while we're at it, let's talk about The Amazing Spider-Man 2. I actually didn't mind it. In fact, I preferred it over TDKR. And speaking of TDKR, that movie had no pacing. Like, at all. And the editing was just all over the place. I mean, come on, Nolan, you can do better than that. And don't even get me started on Color of Pomegranates. I hate that movie. And Apocalypse Now? Meh. And while I'm at it, I find Bicycle Thieves, Nosferatu, and Wanda overrated. Yeah, I said it. Come at me, bro. Anyway, I think I've rambled on enough for now. But before I go, let me just say this: Abel Gance is my lord and savior. And if you don't agree with me, well, that's just too bad.
