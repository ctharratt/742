Wow, can you believe it's been four years since we first discovered Reddit? Time really does fly by. I didn't even realize it was my cake day until I saw the little icon next to my username. But enough about me, let's talk about something that's been on my mind lately. Have you ever heard of the YouTube channel "Dino Kid"? If not, you're missing out. This kid is a genius when it comes to all things dinosaurs. He creates these short, educational videos that are not only informative but also entertaining. And the best part? He's only 10 years old. I stumbled upon his channel a few weeks ago and was blown away by his knowledge and passion for dinosaurs. I mean, I thought I knew a lot about them, but this kid puts me to shame. He's already amassed almost 70,000 subscribers and one of his videos has almost a million views. That's insane for someone so young. But here's the thing that really got me. He recently posted a video saying he was going to close his channel because of impersonators. He was legitimately crying and it broke my heart to hear it. I immediately posted some positive words of encouragement and was happy to see the video taken down less than 10 minutes later. Hopefully, he continues with his videos because he seems to thoroughly enjoy making them. It's amazing to see how much support he's received from the Reddit community. In just under 7 hours, he gained 28,000 subscribers. That's the power of the internet, folks. We can make a difference in someone's life with just a simple gesture. But let's talk about something else that's been on my mind. Police shootings. It's a controversial topic, but one that needs to be addressed. I recently saw a post claiming that more black people are killed by police than any other race. But that's simply not true. In fact, 50% of this year's police shootings involved white suspects, and the other 50% were various minorities including blacks, Mexicans, etc. Of the minority percent, only 33% were black. So please don't try and tell me that more blacks were killed by the police because that is bullshit. Now, I'm not saying that all police shootings are justified. There have been some straight-up murders, and that's not okay. But two wrongs don't make a right. Killing those who protect us is more of a reason for them to just not show up to work anymore. So when that thug breaks into your home and you dial 911, no one will be coming to save you while he bashes in your skull with a hammer then goes and eats a sandwich in your kitchen. Sorry, but this topic really gets me fired up. Let's move on to something a little more lighthearted, shall we? Have you seen those animations of mashed potatoes that look like bison penis? Yeah, me neither. But apparently, someone on Reddit mistook them for each other. I can't even imagine what that would look like. Speaking of things that are hilarious, have you seen that pirated version of the movie with "property of Warner Brothers, do not duplicate" on the screen? Someone must not have or like children because those short videos are awesome and somewhat educational. Also, the kid is not uploading video game footage, so that's also a plus. But let's get back to the Dino Kid. I really think we need to get him to do an AMA about dinosaurs. With his parents' approval and supervision, of course. I would love to pick his brain and learn more about these fascinating creatures. And can we talk about that video of the planes being redirected on 9/11? I never really thought about that until I watched that video about where all those planes would have to go. But I do remember watching the news that day and seeing the report that said all air traffic in the US had been grounded. I guess in my young mind, I just thought the planes magically made it to their destinations without having to stop. Very cool video. But let's not forget about the firefighters who risked their lives to save others on 9/11. That video of the boats evacuating people from Manhattan is truly inspiring. They didn't know if the attack was over or not. The only thing they knew is people needed off that island, and they were one of the few ways off. It still shocks me that over 500,000 people were evacuated in around 9 hours. That is a fuck ton of people! Okay, I think I've rambled on enough for now. But before I go, I just want to say that Reddit is an amazing community. We may not always agree on everything, but we can come together to support each other and make a difference in someone's life. And that's pretty damn cool.
