Ironically, Walt Disney, the man who brought us some of the most beloved animated films of all time, was not always the hero we thought he was. In fact, he had a dark side that many people are not aware of. According to a Reddit discussion titled "Was Walt Disney a Bad Person?", after the success of Snow White, Disney did not promote or give raises to his animators, but instead gave "salary adjustments" to the animators he considered the most exceptional. This led to a strike by his animators in 1941, which was finally resolved after much tension and conflict. Disney, the individual, largely gave up on pushing the "big happy family" picture of the Studio after this incident. Everyone knew it wasn't true, but mostly Disney didn't feel like he could trust anyone anymore. Disney was also a founding member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals in the 1950s, along with prominent film industry right-wingers like John Wayne, Clark Gable, Hedda Hopper, and even Ayn Rand. This group was extremely anti-Communist and a big supporter of the House Un-American Activities Committee (the blacklist). Raised in a distinctively religiously conservative family, Walt was likely discouraged from interaction with people of different skin color, sexual orientations, or even religions. I also recall Gabler commenting on the extreme discipline that Walt faced from his father, perhaps pointing towards why he was a controlling or somewhat forcefully organized person. His upbringing, coupled with the extremely racist era in which he lived, his prejudice is quite obvious. It's important to note that Disney's legacy is not all bad. He was a pioneer in the animation industry and created some of the most beloved characters and stories of all time. However, it's important to acknowledge the darker aspects of his life and legacy. Moving on to other topics, let's talk about movie ratings. The MPAA ratings system is meant to give parents a guideline for what movies are appropriate for their children. However, many people believe that the system is flawed and inconsistent. For example, some movies with graphic violence are rated PG-13, while others with less violence are rated R. Personally, I believe that a good movie is a good movie, regardless of its rating. However, I do think that more pre-information is better for parents. If a movie has graphic violence or sexual content, it's important for parents to know that before deciding whether or not to let their children watch it. Another topic that comes up frequently in discussions about movies is the length of the film. Many people believe that movies should be around two hours long, but I don't think that's necessarily true. If a movie is great and engaging, who cares if it's three hours long? The Dark Knight and The Avengers are both over two hours long, but they are still incredibly popular and well-loved. Of course, there are some movies that are just too long and drag on unnecessarily. It's all about finding the right balance between length and engagement. Finally, let's talk about diversity in Hollywood. It's no secret that Hollywood has a diversity problem. Many movies and TV shows feature predominantly white casts, and people of color are often relegated to supporting roles or stereotypes. However, it's important to note that progress is being made. More and more movies and TV shows are featuring diverse casts and storylines, and there are more opportunities for people of color to work in the industry. That being said, there is still a long way to go. Hollywood needs to do more to promote diversity and inclusivity, both on and off screen. It's not enough to simply cast a few people of color and call it a day. We need to see more diverse stories and perspectives, and we need to see more people of color in positions of power in the industry. In conclusion, there are many different topics to discuss when it comes to movies and Hollywood. From the dark side of Walt Disney to the flaws in the MPAA ratings system, there is always something to talk about. However, it's important to remember that movies are meant to entertain and inspire us, and that's something we can all appreciate.
