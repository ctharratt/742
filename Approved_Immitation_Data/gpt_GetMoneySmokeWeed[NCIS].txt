NCIS has been a staple in my TV watching routine for years now. I remember when I first started watching it, I was hesitant because I wasn't too fond of early naughties TV. But after watching the pilot, I quickly became attached to Tony, Gibbs, Kate, Ducky, and Abby. Kate's death was a shock, but it added to the show's depth and made me even more invested in the characters. Over the years, the show has had its ups and downs, but I've stuck with it through thick and thin. The crossovers with other shows like Hawaii Five-0 and NCIS: LA have been a highlight for me. I love how they incorporate major storyline points in the crossover, and it's what made me want to watch Hawaii Five-0 in the first place. However, the news that Tony won't be returning next season has left me feeling bummed out. He's been one of my favorite characters since the beginning, and I can't imagine the show without him. I watch the opening credits and remember halfway through, and I've even paused an episode from the other night because I just can't bring myself to watch it. Gibbs and McGee are all that's left for me, and while Abby is like a little sister to me, she's been hit or miss lately. Vance doesn't do much for me, and there's no mystery to his character as I know they won't kill him off to leave his kids orphans. If Gibbs were to leave, I don't think I could bear it. I've always thought that the show would end with Gibbs retiring down in Mexico and handing a well-seasoned Tony over the lead. But I guess that's not the case, and it looks like it'll be ending with McGee taking over. Honestly, I'm not sure how I feel about that. McGee took a couple of seasons to grow on me, but with the addition of Ziva, I loved the main four. But I'm not sure if McGee has what it takes to lead the team. One thing I've always appreciated about NCIS is its attention to detail. The writers are fantastic at displaying police work, especially the juxtaposition of Jamie being a beat cop, then Danny the detective, then Frank the commish, and then his father the ex-commish in Blue Bloods. It's like Danny has done everything Jamie has, and some. Frank has done everything Danny has, and some. Then Gramps has done everything Frank has, and some. I've also been a fan of other police procedurals like Monk and Cold Case, and I'm considering watching Law and Order for its legal proceedings. It's rare to see the full proceedings in cop procedurals, but every now and again, we may see the court proceedings for one of these reasons: the person is innocent but has been convicted anyway, the person is guilty but is deemed not guilty by the jury, if somebody's on death row about to be executed, or if it's the premise of the episode, i.e., a juror gets killed. I've always been a quality snob, so I don't want to watch the earlier seasons of some shows, but I hate watching episodes out of order. Danny Pino is in SVU, and I've just finished Cold Case, so I want to watch it for him and all of its other merits. One thing that's been bothering me lately is people conveying their opinion as fact on TV subs and dismissing a show or episode simply because they didn't enjoy it. I didn't enjoy any of the Russian story arch, yet I can still see how it was objectively brilliant. NCIS is the number one most-watched show in the whole world, so the writers can't have given up due to that fact alone. If the writers had given up, they would have simply got another writer to write the episodes. If a writer no longer wishes to write for the show anymore, they can leave freely. In conclusion, NCIS has been a part of my life for years now, and I'm not ready to say goodbye just yet. While the show has had its ups and downs, I've stuck with it through thick and thin. The crossovers with other shows have been a highlight for me, and I appreciate the attention to detail in displaying police work. While I'm bummed out about Tony not returning next season, I'm still invested in the show and its characters.
