It's interesting to see how the political landscape has shifted in recent years. The rise of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump has shaken up the establishment and forced us to reevaluate our assumptions about what is possible in American politics. But amidst all the chaos and uncertainty, one thing remains constant: the power of the corporate elite to shape our political system to their advantage. This is a point that I've been trying to make for some time now, but it seems to fall on deaf ears. Those who support Hillary Clinton seem to be blind to the fact that she is a tool of Wall Street and the establishment, and that her policies are designed to benefit the wealthy at the expense of the working class. I understand that there are many reasons why people support Clinton. Some believe that she is the most electable candidate, while others think that she is the most experienced and qualified. But these arguments miss the point. The real issue is whether Clinton is committed to representing the interests of ordinary Americans, or whether she is beholden to the wealthy donors who fund her campaign. The evidence suggests that Clinton is firmly in the pocket of the corporate elite. She has received millions of dollars in donations from Wall Street and other big business interests, and she has consistently supported policies that benefit these groups at the expense of the rest of us. For example, Clinton has been a strong supporter of free trade agreements like NAFTA and the TPP, which have led to the outsourcing of millions of American jobs and the erosion of our manufacturing base. She has also been a vocal advocate of deregulation, which has allowed Wall Street to engage in risky and often fraudulent behavior with little or no consequences. In addition, Clinton has a long history of supporting tough-on-crime policies that have disproportionately affected communities of color. She has supported mandatory minimum sentences, three-strikes laws, and other measures that have led to mass incarceration and the criminalization of poverty. All of these policies are antithetical to the values of the progressive movement, and they are a clear indication that Clinton is not the champion of the working class that she claims to be. Instead, she is a politician who is willing to sell out her constituents in order to curry favor with the wealthy and powerful. Of course, there are those who will argue that Clinton is the lesser of two evils, and that we must support her in order to prevent a Trump presidency. But this argument is deeply flawed. First of all, it assumes that Clinton is the only viable alternative to Trump, which is simply not true. There are other candidates, like Jill Stein of the Green Party, who offer a truly progressive vision for America. Secondly, it assumes that Clinton is the only candidate who can defeat Trump, which is also not true. Polls consistently show that Bernie Sanders would have a better chance of beating Trump than Clinton, and that he is more popular among independent voters and young people. Finally, it assumes that Clinton is a reliable ally in the fight against Trumpism, which is highly doubtful. Clinton has a long history of triangulating and compromising with Republicans, and there is no reason to believe that she would be any more effective than Obama in standing up to the right-wing agenda. In short, the case for Clinton is weak at best, and it is based on a flawed understanding of the political landscape. If we want to build a truly progressive movement in America, we must reject the politics of compromise and incrementalism, and we must embrace a bold and visionary agenda that puts the needs of ordinary Americans first. This means supporting candidates who are not beholden to the corporate elite, and who are committed to fighting for economic and social justice. It means rejecting the politics of fear and division, and embracing a politics of hope and solidarity. And it means recognizing that the only way to defeat Trumpism is to build a movement that is truly inclusive and democratic, and that is capable of challenging the power of the wealthy and powerful. So let us not be fooled by the empty promises of the establishment, or by the fear-mongering of the right. Let us stand together and fight for a better future for all Americans, one that is based on the principles of justice, equality, and democracy. Only then can we truly say that we are the land of the free and the home of the brave.
