Yo, what's up my fellow Grump fans? I gotta say, I am absolutely loving those dubbed claps. They just add that extra level of hilarity to an already funny show. And don't even get me started on the jokes - I mean, come on, we're all here for the laughs, right? I just hope I'm not breaking any rules by cracking a few jokes myself. But hey, if I am, I'll just get off at the next stop. Speaking of stops, can we talk about how excited I am for more Golf Grumps? I mean, who doesn't love watching these guys play golf and make hilarious commentary at the same time? And that sympathy cough during that one video? Classic. I just hope they get enough views to keep making more of these gems. Now, I gotta say, I agree with that fantasy theory about the JonTron episode. I mean, it's totally possible that we all slipped into a coma and missed the end of it, right? And speaking of crossovers, what did the Grumps do in Red vs. Blue? I gotta know. And that Arin drawing? It reminded me of this picture I saw recently and gave me a panic attack. But hey, thanks for the comment, I totally forgot what was going on and thought he said "Asian". And that PAX Ross video they were talking about? Anyone have a link? But let's get back to the important stuff - Mario Maker. I mean, Arin better pull off some head droppers, double under dixie downs, quadruple cascades, and under the bridge diggy danglers. And that last death had me laughing like Ross - I need help. And can we talk about how much we love Barry's improv in between the other characters' monologues? And that cheese bit? Classic. And Undertale? I mean, who hasn't heard some good Undine voices in a playthrough? And that water boarded bit with Barry? Hilarious. And I never knew all this stuff I've already watched was her work! But let's not forget about Manny, the shopkeep merchant guy. I still think he's a secret member. And speaking of Mario, wouldn't it be cool to see a mod where dead Marios stay on the map? And that animation? So well done. And did he really call the service bad or was it just inconvenient? And that girl in the Sonic forest/temple stage? She had a mix of surprise, funny, and joy sprinkled in. And can we talk about how we all started watching Game Grumps from the very beginning? I mean, I was getting into some old school video games that were too hard to beat without mastering them, so I googled some let's play and stumbled upon this gem. And seeing Egoraptor hosting it? Mind-blowing. So there you have it, folks. My thoughts on all the important topics in the Grump world. Keep on watching and laughing, and let's hope for more Golf Grumps in the future.
