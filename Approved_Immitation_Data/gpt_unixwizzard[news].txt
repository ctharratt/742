As I sit here reading about the police pursuit of Simpson's stolen vehicle, I can't help but feel a sense of anger and frustration. These cops were clearly out for blood, with one officer even asking the other if he wanted his shotgun or his AR. It's like they were just waiting for an excuse to act as executioner. And when they got stuck in the snow, they were even more pissed off, calling Simpson a "little fucker" and complaining about how they go steal cars and break into shit. It's like they had already convicted him in their minds and were just waiting for the chance to take him down. But what really gets me is the way some people talk about veterans and the VA. Sure, there may be some who abuse the system, but most of the people seeking care through the VA are veterans who were injured in the line of duty or have little to no income and nowhere else to turn. These are people who put their lives on the line for our country, and we owe it to them to take care of them. And yet, so many veterans have Hep C. Why is that? Well, there are lots of reasons, but the fact is that if they catch it after getting home, it's still the taxpayer's problem. That's just the social contract we made with our veterans back in the 1930s. We promised to take care of them if they honorably served our country, and we need to keep that promise. Of course, the U.S. government is not exactly known for its logic and common sense. It's going to cost around $22 billion to cure all the veterans with Hep C, and that's a lot of money. But Congress recently passed legislation giving the VA the extra money it needs to cover this treatment, so hopefully, we can start taking care of our veterans the way they deserve. And then there's the case of the man who was shot by the police. If he was reaching for a gun, why didn't the officer who had his gun drawn already fire? It's like the officer with the best view of the suspect and his hands didn't see anything or feel it was necessary to shoot, but the officer who was sneaking up from behind did. It just doesn't make sense to me. But what really grinds my gears is the way the WTO is screwing over the U.S. meat industry. Congress had to get rid of the labels because the WTO repeatedly ruled against them, and now Canada and Mexico can slap $1 billion in tariffs on U.S. meats in retaliation. It's like we're damned if we do and damned if we don't. If we kept the labels, we'd be accused of killing jobs, but if we got rid of them, we're accused of catering to "big meat" interests. It's just not fair. In the end, I think education needs to be our nation's number one priority. Above jobs, above national defense, above everything else. We need to educate our people so they can make informed decisions and hold our government accountable. We need to educate our children so they can grow up to be responsible citizens. And we need to educate our veterans so they can get the care they deserve. It's time to start investing in our future, and education is the key.
