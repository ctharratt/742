Remote work has become increasingly popular in recent years, and with the current global pandemic, it has become a necessity for many. However, working remotely can come with its own set of challenges, especially when it comes to accessing files and programs on a different device. In this article, we will explore the possibility of using a thin client device to remotely access a home laptop and the various software and hardware considerations that come with it. Firstly, let's define what a thin client device is. A thin client is a lightweight computer that relies on a server to perform most of its processing tasks. It is typically used in an enterprise/corporate environment, where servers hosted in the office datacentre or a collocation centre offsite would run all the programs and host all the data, and the thin clients would just access them remotely. However, it is possible to use a thin client device on a domestic basis to remotely access a home laptop. The first consideration when setting up a thin client device is the software. There are several options available for remotely accessing a home laptop, including Remote Desktop Connection (RDP), Virtual Private Network (VPN), and third-party remote software such as Teamviewer and Splashtop. RDP is a built-in feature in Windows 7 pro, 8, and 10 that allows you to connect to any PC on the same network. However, this cannot apply to a thin client device accessing a home laptop on a different network. To overcome this, a VPN can be created to create an encrypted bridge between the two networks, allowing devices to think they are on the same network. Windows has its own VPN version, which is less complicated than OpenVPN but less secure. Setting up a VPN is relatively easy, and there are many tutorials available online. Third-party remote software such as Teamviewer and Splashtop can also be used to remotely access a home laptop. Teamviewer is free for personal use but struggles with media-related tasks such as video playback. Splashtop is free to use over the same network but requires payment to connect to a device on a different network. However, it has good video playback and can even be used to play games. Once the software is set up, the next consideration is the hardware. A thin client device typically does not require much processing power as it relies on the server to perform most of its processing tasks. However, it is important to choose a device that is capable of working offline as well as online. This is because relying solely on internet connectivity can leave you unable to work without internet access. Data backup is also an important consideration when setting up a thin client device. The 3-2-1 rule is a good guideline to follow when it comes to data backup. This rule states that you should have at least three copies of your data, in two different formats, with one of those copies off-site. Backblaze is a good option for off-site backup, as it periodically uploads files and folders to their servers, which can be recovered later. An external hard drive is also a good option for local backup, but it should be kept separate from the laptop and backed up regularly. In conclusion, using a thin client device to remotely access a home laptop is possible, but it comes with its own set of challenges and considerations. The software options include RDP, VPN, and third-party remote software such as Teamviewer and Splashtop. The hardware should be capable of working offline as well as online, and data backup is essential to prevent data loss. By following these guidelines, it is possible to set up a reliable and secure system for remote work.
