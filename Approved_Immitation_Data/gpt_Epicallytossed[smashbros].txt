I'm not sure what the fuck Blea Gelo's middle name is, but I'm pretty sure it's not Picasso. And can we just take a moment to appreciate how out of his mind Duck has been playing recently? I mean, damn. That guy is on fire. But let's talk about the real shit. The recent Smash tournament has been insane. Did you see that risky click of the day? Holy shit. And SHE WON THE BALLOT TOO? That's some next level hype right there. But let's get into the nitty gritty. Loser's Semis was a tough match between Weston "Westballz" Dennis and Justin "Plup" McGrath. And let me tell you, Plup was on fire. He took that shit 3-0, no problem. But then we had the Winners Finals between Juan "Hungrybox" Debiedma and Adam "Armada" Lindgren. And let me tell you, that was a nail biter. But in the end, Hungrybox came out on top with a 3-1 victory. And then we had the Loser's Finals between Armada and Plup. And let me tell you, Armada was not fucking around. He took that shit 3-0, no problem. Overall, this tournament has been insane. And can we just take a moment to appreciate Abadango's performance? That man played out of his goddamn mind. Someone needs to sponsor him ASAP. But let's talk about some other shit. Like, where the fuck has Isai gone? Apparently he's a pro poker player now? That's some crazy shit. And can we talk about how oddshot is run by one dude? That's some impressive shit right there. And apparently he created it for CS? That's some next level dedication. But let's get back to the tournament. Can we talk about how Zero lost because of that one moment? God damnit. That shit was heartbreaking. And can we talk about how Leffen unleashed MacD to unplug the cable, ending the game before the last stock was taken? That shit was hilarious. I mean, come on. That's some next level trolling. But let's talk about something serious for a moment. The professionalism in the Smash community has been a topic of discussion lately. And I have to say, I agree with some of the criticisms. Like, remember when Hungrybox started crying at MVG? That shit was unprofessional as fuck. And that rude tweet he made? Not cool, man. But let's end on a positive note. This tournament has been insane, and I can't wait to see what happens next. And can we just take a moment to appreciate Chibo? That man is everywhere. And he's killing it. So here's to you, Chibo. Keep doing what you're doing.
