Ha ha, well, let me tell you, I was not surprised when Liv was called upon to donate blood. I mean, come on, it's not like she didn't have months to prepare an excuse. But apparently, Liv didn't think of that. And now she's not telling the truth because she thinks it will put her loved ones in danger. How does that even work? Do they think they'll catch zombie cooties just from knowing about zombies? I mean, come on, this is iZombie we're talking about. They have a made-up drug, a made-up energy drink, and even a made-up astronaut. Who knows what other crazy things they have in that world? Maybe cloning is just slightly more advanced than it is here, and interested amateurs can do it in their home lab. But let's talk about Zoom for a second. I mean, poor Jay, he couldn't stand far enough away to escape the power of PLOTFORCE. And that bigot? Ugh, don't even get me started. Liv had been a zombie for months, she had plenty of prep time for any likely eventuality - including an unexpected need for blood donation. Liv really ought to have thought of this before it happened. But then again, she could always say "I'm sorry, Clive, for some reason I'm getting these completely unrelated visions, like psychic static. I'll try harder next week." And what about Major? I don't think he's going to appreciate having another chain on him, especially to that jackass Blaine. And now the FBI can draw another connection between the two of them, and they're both tied to the Chaos Killer murders. Unless Daddy Blaine really holds out against the other zombies. Although the show acts like this is safe to assume, it's really not. Rats simply don't live as long as humans and a sample size of one is really nothing to get too worked up over. I mean, really, Hope could have died from simple depression over being locked up in solitary for so many months, rats being highly social animals. But let's not forget about Buffy and Angel. My sister just finished a re-watch of Buffy and I mentioned that he came back to life in Angel. "What, really? Is he still hot?" ... "You know, Jenn, if it's all about the bleach blond bad boys, you now have time - " "No." "You don't even know what I'm - " "I'm not watching iZombie with you." My own sister! What sort of person does that to her own flesh and blood? And don't even get me started on CPR. So not romantic. Broken ribs just aren't sexy, even if you have super healing. But vampires probably shouldn't be able to have sex either. And what about Blaine? He deserves a little fun after what his dad evidently put him through. But I wouldn't want to go up against the guy who's taking Boss on. I hope everybody kicks the crap out of him and his smarmy face. Overall, iZombie is a crazy show with so many characters and so much going on. It's easy to lose track, but it's always entertaining. And who knows what crazy plot twists they'll come up with next? Maybe Liv will finally come up with a good excuse for not donating blood, or maybe Blaine will finally get what's coming to him. Either way, I'll be watching.
