Well, well, well, look who we have here. Another ignorant fool spewing hate and nonsense. You sound like Hitler talking about Jews and Gypsies and anyone who wasn't White and Christian. How many Muslims do you actually know to make such a racist statement? I bet the answer is none. You're just regurgitating the same old hateful rhetoric that's been spoon-fed to you by the media. And let's talk about mass shootings, shall we? 98% of the time, it's a White Christian male. Do you start saying Christians can be turned into terrorists so easily? Of course not. Remember Sandy Hook? The shooter was a lifetime NRA member who murdered 20 first graders and 6 teachers. And what did you say then? Probably nothing, because you only care about demonizing Muslims. It's not race or religion that's the problem, it's people. It's not Islam, it's extremists. No idea can only be used for good or evil. Eugenics could help prevent billions of people from dying from cancer in the distant future, but it's wrong because of its extreme chance for abuse. And let's not forget that no single label is only good or only evil. The Quakers and the Catholic Church are both Christian. Israel and many who oppose the apartheid in Israel are Jewish. Malcolm X and Ben Carson are both black. Jack the Ripper and Neville Chamberlain are both British. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are both Americans. The world is not black and white, and you and someone you hate can both claim to believe the same things, because lies, denial, and delusion exist. And let's talk about immigration. The US has had the biggest open border policy since 1981. And who gave full amnesty to over 25 million illegal aliens and their families? Ronald Anil Reagan! Before we preach to others, we must first shut down all the greedy American employers who only hire cheap non-Americans. And just to be clear, I am not your mate. And let me guess, you and your sister-mating inbreeds probably voted for the biggest losers twice. First in 2008, you must have voted for McRage and Barbie. And you all lost. And again in 2012, you must have voted for RomNuts, and yet again, you all lost. That makes you and all your inbreeds the biggest losers. And to make things really bad, there are over 400 very long days to go. That's over 9600 hours of suffering to go. It just doesn't get better than this. And let's talk about Trump. He's only into foreign child brides, currently on his 6th one. And you all voted for the biggest losers twice. That just makes you all losers. And to make things even worse, there are over 400 very long days to go. That's over 9600 hours of suffering to go. It just doesn't get better than this. And let's not forget about cheating. About 600 high school students in eastern India have been expelled for cheating on pressure-packed 10th grade examinations this week. Cheating seems to be particularly widespread in Bihar, although there have been no reports of anyone being sent to jail for the offense. And let's talk about H-1B visas. If all these fake degree H-1B/L1 and illegal aliens job thieves are so hardworking and so highly skilled and so smart, then why isn't their own country bending over backwards to keep these people? Is India/China/Mexico/Vietnam or Euro-trash countries so well developed that it no longer needs its own hardworking citizens to maintain its economy and infrastructure? Of course not, this is really an attempt by the governments of India/China/Mexico and Euro-trash to shirk millions of its poor citizens off on another country (the US) without any consequences. All H-1B/L1 visa holders and visa overstayers plus all the illegal aliens and all who hire them are all the real terrorists. And let's not forget about Ben Carson. He said that "we'd be Cuba if there were no Fox News." He also said that "many Americans are stupid." And if the polls are correct, then I guess he is correct: "many Americans are stupid." He also said that "Obamacare is the worst thing to happen in the USA since slavery." And he also said that "if Germans had owned guns, Hitler wouldn't have come to power." And he also said that "straight people going to jail come out gay." Yep, just remember all those "stupid Americans" who voted for him in the poll also know all the above. Yep, he is correct on one thing, there are some "stupid Americans." And let's not forget about Israel and Palestine. The conflict there is a complicated issue, and it's not as simple as one side being right and the other being wrong. And let's not forget about how the Jews treat Christians in Israel. It's serious, and it's something that needs to be addressed. And let's not forget about the media. They're just as guilty as anyone else of spreading hate and lies. They're the ones who are constantly pushing their own agenda and demonizing anyone who doesn't agree with them. So, in conclusion, let's all try to be a little more open-minded and understanding. Let's not demonize entire groups of people based on the actions of a few extremists. Let's not let the media control our thoughts and opinions. And let's not forget that we're all human beings, and we all deserve to be treated with respect and dignity.
