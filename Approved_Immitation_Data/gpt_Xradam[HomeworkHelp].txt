I swear to god, I don't understand why math has to be so damn complicated. I mean, seriously, why can't they just give us a straightforward answer instead of making us jump through all these hoops? I'm trying to figure out how to find the legs of a right triangle, and this stupid book is not helping at all. I mean, sure, they give us the formula for the hypotenuse, but what about the legs? And why do we have to use radical 2? Can't we just use a regular number like 2 or 3? And what the hell is a hypotenuse anyway? I thought we were just supposed to find the length of the sides. And don't even get me started on precalc and calculus. Does that shit include a lot of Algebra 2? Because I barely passed that class and I don't want to have to deal with it again. I'm looking at this equation and it says to change a2+b2 into x2+x2=c2. What the hell does that even mean? And why do we have to simplify it to 4 +/- 2i Radical 6 / 4? That makes no sense to me. And then there's this other equation where I have to factor t2-2t. What the hell are the factors of that? And what does correlation have to do with anything? I'm so lost. And don't even get me started on my teacher. She has a 1.4 rating on Rate My Professor and I can see why. She doesn't even teach us anything. She just writes stuff on the board and expects us to know what she's talking about. And when I ask her if I did something correctly, she just says "I think so" and moves on. How the hell am I supposed to learn anything like that? I feel like I'm missing out on so much and I don't even know where to start. I mean, I thought I knew Algebra, but apparently not. And now I'm supposed to learn all this other stuff and I don't even know where to begin. I wish there was an easier way to learn all this stuff. Like, why can't they just give us a step-by-step guide or something? Or maybe a video tutorial? I don't know, anything would be better than this. I'm just so frustrated right now. I feel like I'm never going to understand any of this. And I don't even know if I'm asking the right questions or if I'm just making a fool of myself. But I guess I have to keep trying. I mean, I can't just give up now. Maybe if I keep practicing and asking questions, I'll eventually get it. Or maybe I'll just have to accept that I'm not cut out for math. Either way, I'm not giving up yet. I'll keep trying until I figure this out. Even if it takes me forever.
