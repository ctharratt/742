Hey there, fellow gamer! I couldn't help but notice your post about The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and all the cool stuff you have in your gaming room. I have to say, I'm pretty jealous of your GTA poster and your 55 inch UHDTV. I mean, my gaming TV isn't even pushing 50 inches, but I guess it gets the job done. Anyway, I totally agree with you about The Witcher 3 being an amazing game. I've been playing it for a while now and I'm still not bored. I love how engaged the story gets me and how beautiful the open world is. I mean, even being almost a year old, it's still god damn beautiful. I also agree with you about the difficulty level. At first, I was like holy fucking shit this is hard. It took me until about level 20 to really grasp dodging and diving correctly. You really gotta pay attention to the enemies' attacks and learn the pattern, then dodge accordingly. But once you get the hang of it, it's so satisfying to take down those tough enemies. I've been playing on Blood and Broken Bones as well, and I have to say, it's a good challenge. I'm currently at level 35 and I don't see myself making it to level 50-60 with the available quests and such. But who knows, maybe I'll surprise myself. I also love how the enemies scale with you. I was hesitant to turn on enemy scaling at first because I thought it would suck to kill a bunch of weak enemies, but it's actually amazing. It keeps the game challenging and interesting, even when you're at a high level. I've also been thinking about trying out a magic-only build. I've been using a half magic/half melee build, but I think it would be cool to focus solely on magic. And I totally agree with you about the armor sets. The "Legendary Griffin Armor" looks just like the "Griffin Armor" from when I was level 11. All they did was change the name and stats of the same armor set, so my technically better "Legendary Griffin Armor" looks like shit compared to my "Mastercrafted Griffin Armor". It's kind of disappointing, but I guess that's just how it goes. I've also been playing on NewGame+ and I have to say, it's pretty sweet. It lets you keep your skills and all that, but it also allows you to stay whatever level you were. I got to level 31 before downloading Hearts of Stone, and now I'm at level 35. I don't know what the highest level I'll achieve is, but I'm having a blast playing. And don't even get me started on the romance options. I mean, banging Triss AND Yen is the only problem? I did notice one really weird thing that happened. I went to my first brothel and banged this super hottie, and then a good while later Yennefer decided we should meet there for business. I was like uuuhhh....am I in trouble? She didn't mention a thing about the fact that the hooker was just asking if I wanted "the same as last time" haha. But in all seriousness, I love how the game lets you make choices and affect the outcome of the story. It's so immersive and engaging. Overall, I think The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is one of the best games I've ever played. It's challenging, beautiful, and engaging. And I have to say, I'm pretty addicted to it right now. I can't wait to see what other adventures Geralt will go on. Anyway, thanks for sharing your thoughts on the game and your cool gaming room. It's always nice to connect with fellow gamers and share our experiences. Happy gaming!
