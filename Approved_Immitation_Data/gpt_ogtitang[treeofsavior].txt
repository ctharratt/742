Yo, what's up guys? It's your boy here, and I gotta say, I'm hyped for this game. But let's be real, the launch hype is putting some serious stress on the servers. I mean, I'm not doubting their capacity to operate, but let's give it a few hours and they'll be back to normal. And then we can enjoy that low"er" ping, am I right? But let's talk about FTP. I mean, sure, you can play for free, but let's be real, you're gonna end up buying an account to play more likely. And I heard the lag is terrible, so I'm just gonna wait for that good ole international OBT with those juicy SG/MY servers for sub 100 ping. It's OBT, and a lot of players are trying to play due to the hype. But give it a week or two and it'll relax down to your normal 200-300. And best of all, enjoy the holidays! But let's be real, I hope we can play though. I'm still waiting for confirmation before buying an account. You never know, they might do something sneaky to stop us from playing. And based on my understanding, PlayOne and int servers are different. Will the SEA version have a CBT to do a stress test on the servers or will it immediately go OBT? Are they in CBT now? And will you be able to change the text to English though? I see. I mean, there's PlayOne Asia coming up on March next year, so I can wait 3 months just to be sure that I can play comfortably. Tweaking the user>config xml won't work? Guess not, coz Blackshot is in OBT. But then again, it might be because it's an FPS. There goes the endgame. But let's talk about my friend who's a gamer, but the mobile kind. 99% of his time is spent on Clash of Clans, so I guess I'm free to have him make me an account. And for some reason, I read this as "Just your random spoiler." Lol, I haven't made up my mind yet. Still debating whether I should have a friend of mine in Korea make me an account or buy one from onegameway. I hope they don't change anything in OBT though so we can still play on it. Me and a group of friends are from the Philippines, and we surely will have lower ping in KR Servers compared to NA(International) servers. Question, there are no IP restrictions right? As long as you have a verified Nexon KR account, you're good to go? Oh really? Oh well. I don't mind that at all, I just want my god damn OBT! Blue mobs might spawn at an increased rate in OBT. I mean, no one knows, everything else is just up in the air at this point, and we can only tell when KR OBT comes. Hopefully, it'll come before the end of 2015 though. I know that might be a long shot, but I mean, there's nothing wrong with hoping for something good before Christmas. But let's talk about that Doom spear. I'm guessing it costs a lot, coz there's 0 recipes in the market. But still, thank you! I'll try to look for one or try and form an Elements if I can. And all I heard was if a certain type of weapon had elemental damage, then your attacks and skills will deal that type of damage as well? And since you have 4 different elements, then they probably increase your damage a whole lot? Check this guy out since he has one. But let's talk about servers. What server are you looking to do this in? I'm also experienced if you know what I'm saying. And I actually enjoy the grind coz it's easy money. No where in my post where I cried about exp rates / grind. I just stated it's a bit slow imo, also a few title changes and the world goes nuts. I just read it somewhere in this forum about 2 weeks ago. CBA to look for it coz I'm busy playing the game, not being a Reddit warrior. But let's talk about Doppel. I just managed to unlock it a few hours ago, and what I can say is Mordschlag has decent damage but not worth the cast time, good stun though; Punish needs a knocked down enemy-minimal setup; Deeds of valor need you to be hit by mobs which DEX type swordies are the mainstream so kinda meh; Double Pay Earn is just a wasted skill; Cyclone on the other hand is OP :) But let's talk about that exp grind. It's slow, but you have to realize we got 3x (before extension) more exp than what kOBT will be in December. Even with all these exp buffs, it still is kind of slow. Game is going to be renamed to Tree of Grinders, Grind of Saviors, or Demon Prison Online soon. And passing my money from toon to toon and enduring the 10% tax is annoying as hell. And as for your Arde, I'm sorry to hear that my friend. It is closed beta at least, so technically you didn't lose anything. Cheer up! But let's talk about that Nulis recipe. Was able to ninja that recipe, but too bad I'm broke and I can't complete it. And you have to have someone in KR though, or else you won't receive the text notification. And pretty much, that's why I was thinking of Barb 3 then Doppel. But then again, a friend said Doppel is a disappointment either ;/ But let's talk about that Aston 2H. I'm actually going to invest my money into getting that since I think I won't have time to farm for a Nulis. And thank you for the input brother. Noted. I was planning since I fcked up and went 2HL that after 2Barb I might go Corsair instead of Doppel. But let's talk about the game itself. Fix your bugs and work on your balancing before you do anything else. Those changes are not game breaking, and we'd rather have a full functioning game ready in a few months for OBT than voice overs. And let's be real, that boss bullet thing that makes you crash is slowing people down. It is closed beta after all, you never know they might change it to Grind of Savior, or Demon Prison Online. But let's talk about leveling. Questing is actually the best way at lower levels. Do all subquests and main storyline while saving your exp cards, then when you hit a wall, just pop all your cards. Problem solved. But at higher levels though, 130-140+~175s grinding is the only way to level. And let's not forget that Swordsmen have a stronger type of passive regen than anyone else in RO though. But let's talk about my friends. I have no friends in this game. Not yet. I've only done like 1 dungeon in the almost 2 week period that I participated in this beta. But let's be real, I'm excited on that exp curb on 186. And let's not forget that I'm also experienced if you know what I'm saying. But let's talk about the future. The game still needs a lot of work, but I don't mind waiting a couple more months for a more polished ToS with minimal bugs. And let's not forget that we gotta support people who promote the game. And let's not forget that I hope they fix that with later's maintenance. But let's talk about the endgame. Should I stick with my Lydeka till I get an Elements? Thank you! But unfortunately, I'm guessing Doom spear costs a lot. There's 0 recipes in the market. But still, thank you! Will try to look for one or try and form an Elements if I can. But let's talk about the stats. Have you tested out different stat combinations? Like pure str and/or pure dex? Or is 1:2 like the best formula for cata right now? And let's not forget that you gotta do all of that. Thanks. And let's not forget that it's closed beta after all, you never know they might change it to Grind of Savior, or Demon Prison Online. But let's talk about the holidays. Enjoy them, guys! And let's not forget that I'm hyped for this game.
