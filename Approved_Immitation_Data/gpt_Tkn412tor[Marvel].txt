So, I've been thinking a lot about the new Marvel Universe and what it means for our favorite characters. There's been a lot of hype around this "massive reset" and the destruction of the universe with every story ending, but I have to admit, I'm a little underwhelmed with what we've seen so far. Don't get me wrong, I'm excited to see what changes are coming and I'll definitely be picking up some of the new books, but I was expecting something more drastic. I thought we might see new characters stepping into the roles of our favorites, or at least some major shakeups in the status quo. Instead, it feels like we're getting a new Marvel Now! with the same characters fighting the same bad guys in a universe that's probably going to be pretty similar to Earth-616. I'm not saying that's a bad thing necessarily, but it's not exactly what I was hoping for. That being said, there are a few things that have caught my attention and piqued my interest. For one, I'm curious to see how the X-Men will be integrated into the new universe. With the Inhumans taking center stage in recent years, it's been a bit of a struggle for the X-Men to find their place. But with the recent announcement of a new X-Men title, it seems like they'll be getting some much-needed attention. I'm also intrigued by the new Iron Man, or should I say Ironheart? Riri Williams is a young black woman who has built her own Iron Man suit and is taking on the mantle of the Armored Avenger. It's a bold move, and one that I think has a lot of potential. I'm excited to see where her story goes and how she'll fit into the larger Marvel Universe. Another thing that's caught my eye is the return of the Champions. This was a team of young heroes that was first introduced in the 70s, but hasn't been seen much since then. Now, they're getting their own book with a new lineup that includes Ms. Marvel, Nova, and the Totally Awesome Hulk. It's a diverse and interesting group, and I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of adventures they'll have. But overall, I have to say that I'm a little disappointed with the lack of major changes in the new Marvel Universe. It feels like we're getting more of the same, just with a fresh coat of paint. And while I'm sure there will be some great stories to come out of this, I can't help but feel like we missed an opportunity to really shake things up. That being said, I'm still excited to see what the future holds for our favorite heroes. There are always new stories to be told and new adventures to be had, and I have no doubt that Marvel will continue to deliver on that front. In the meantime, I'll be keeping an eye on the new books and characters, and hoping that we'll see some truly groundbreaking changes in the Marvel Universe in the years to come. Who knows, maybe we'll get that new Iron Man or Spider-Man after all.
