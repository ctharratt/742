Well, well, well, here we are again, my friends. Let's talk about exploration, shall we? I mean, we shouldn't keep all our eggs in one basket, right? That's what Hawking said, and he was a pretty smart guy, so I'm inclined to agree with him. But, hear me out, what if we focused more on deep sea diving instead of dreaming about planet hopping? I mean, there are probably so many novel creatures and compounds for medicine in the oceans that we haven't even discovered yet. It's like a whole other world down there, and we're just scratching the surface. Now, I know what you're thinking, "But, we need to planet hop as soon as possible!" And I get it, I really do. We don't want to have all our eggs in one basket, like Hawking said. But, let's take care of that first and then invest in exploration for the sake of exploration. It's like when you're trying to clean your room, you don't start organizing your closet before you've picked up all the clothes off the floor. You know what I mean? Speaking of Mother Teresa, let me tell you a little story. One time, I wanted to smooth things over with her by challenging her to a game of Wii Sports Baseball. I mean, who wouldn't want to play Wii Sports with Mother Teresa, am I right? But, she refused to put on the strap, even after I politely asked her to. Long story short, I lost by mercy rule and asked her to leave in an orderly fashion. But, instead of leaving, she asked me for $3.50. That's when I realized that she wasn't Mother Teresa at all, but a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. I told her, "I ain't givin' you no tree-fitty, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!" And then she disappeared quicker than Jesus after his resurrection. True story. But, let's get back to the topic at hand. Why worry about something inevitable, right? I mean, if you don't think about it, it's suddenly not there. It's like when you're trying to fall asleep and you can't stop thinking about all the things you have to do the next day. But, if you just clear your mind and focus on your breathing, you'll eventually drift off. This guy knows what he's talking about. Now, I know some people might be hesitant about using psychedelic substances, but hear me out. They can be therapeutic if used in the right way. You just need to have a calm and humble mindset and isolate yourself from any hostile people, like your parents or your boss. Trust yourself and the experience will be valuable 100/100 times. And if you're interested in exploring this path, I recommend downloading the Tor browser and using this link to research all substances diligently. Be safe and good luck. It's important for society not to have preconceived prejudices about any psychedelic chemical. Who knows what benefits other things 'locked away' from the scientific community might have? We need to keep an open mind and explore all possibilities. And let's not forget about death. It's something that we all have to face eventually, but it's not something to be feared. There is no experienced "moment" of death, it's like the moment just before you go to sleep. You can't remember when it happened. But, just remember that death cannot be experienced. Your current "self" will disappear eventually, but existence is just a continuous stream of consciousness. And finally, let's talk about Nikola Tesla. Did you know that he was quoted in a letter as saying he had worked on something for more than 40 years? I mean, that's dedication right there. We could all learn a thing or two from him. So, my friends, let's keep exploring and keep an open mind. Who knows what we might discover?
