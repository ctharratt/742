In the world of gaming, there are always debates about which control scheme is the best. Some people swear by the traditional keyboard and mouse setup, while others prefer the ease and comfort of a controller. As someone who has played a variety of games on both PC and console, I can see the benefits and drawbacks of each option. One game that I wish had the option to use a controller on PC is Diablo 3. I love the idea of being able to kick back on my couch and play through a few grifts, but I understand that this would upset the balance of the leaderboard system. One control scheme will inevitably be better than the other, and it wouldn't be fair to mix them. However, I do think that having the option to choose would be a nice addition for those who prefer the console experience. Another game that has caused quite a stir in the gaming community is Undertale. While some people absolutely love it and evangelize it to anyone who will listen, others have lost interest in it for a variety of reasons. Personally, I fall into the latter category. I find the game to be repetitive and not particularly engaging, but I understand that others may have a different opinion. It's all a matter of personal taste. When it comes to multiplayer games, I tend to avoid MOBAs and serious shooters like Battlefield and Call of Duty. The online playerbases for these games can be incredibly toxic, and I don't want to waste my time being berated or flamed for being a casual player. However, I do enjoy games like Team Fortress 2 and am looking forward to Overwatch. These games strike a good balance between fun and competitiveness, and I don't feel like I'm constantly being judged for my skill level. One trend that I've noticed in recent years is the rise of YouTuber reviews. Many people are turning to these personalities for a more personal and impartial view of games, as traditional gaming media outlets are often seen as being in the pockets of publishers. While some of the larger YouTube personalities may also have ties to publishers, there are plenty of smaller channels that offer honest and insightful reviews. When it comes to control schemes, I think that with enough practice, you can get to the same level of proficiency with a keyboard and mouse as you can with a controller. Control systems like WASD, MOBO-style hotkeys, and SC2 mappings have been developed and refined over the course of decades, and they are extremely intuitive once you get enough practice with them. However, there are certainly some control schemes that are just plain bad, like Fallout 4's GUI. In terms of older games, I think that many classic Nintendo games from the 90s are still very playable today. Games like Mario Kart 64, Yoshi's Island, Banjo-Kazooie, Zelda LttP, and Super Metroid are all still enjoyable, especially when played with friends in local multiplayer. However, there are also some classics that haven't aged well, like Goldeneye/Perfect Dark, which suffer from poor controls. One game that I think would be panned if it were released today is Starcraft 2. While it was a very well-polished and innovative RTS at the time of its release, it would have a hard time competing with newer games in the genre. Back in the day, there were many great RTS games like Age of Empires, Brood War, the Command & Conquer series, and Total Annihilation, but now the market seems to be dominated by one big player. Another game that has received a lot of praise over the years is The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. While it was certainly innovative and groundbreaking at the time of its release, it has many flaws compared to newer Zelda games and modern story-driven RPGs. However, to say that it's a "shitty game with a boring plot and even worse gameplay" is doing a disservice to one of gaming's measuring sticks. When it comes to first-person shooters, I find that I'm much better with a keyboard and mouse than with twin sticks on a controller. However, I can see how some people might prefer the latter option. It all comes down to personal preference and what you're used to. One game that I think sets the bar impossibly high is The Binding of Isaac. It has oodles of content and replayability, and it's just as addictive as Spelunky. While Spelunky is simple and elegant, Isaac has a lot more depth and variety. It's a game that I keep coming back to time and time again. Finally, I want to touch on the topic of Earthbound. While some people absolutely love this game and are willing to pay exorbitant prices for it, I just don't see what all the fuss is about. To me, it's just a generic 16-bit RPG with an oddball aesthetic. However, I understand that others may have a different opinion, and that's okay. In conclusion, the debate over control schemes will likely continue for years to come. While some people prefer the traditional keyboard and mouse setup, others enjoy the ease and comfort of a controller. Ultimately, it all comes down to personal preference and what you're used to.
