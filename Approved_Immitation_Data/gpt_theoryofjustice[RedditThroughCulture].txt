I must say, I have my doubts about this whole situation. It seems unlikely that we will ever be able to work with someone of such low birth. Perhaps it would be best to send one of our degree-holding associates to take care of the matter. A powerful man, someone who can get the job done. But before we do that, we should really have the plumber overhaul the sanitary installations of our castle. Can't have any leaks or clogs when we're dealing with such important matters. As part of an optional test protocol, I have an amusing fact to share with you all. Did you know that 86.5% of all lemonade makers think that the best part about lemonade is the squeezing? Squeezing...squeezing...squeezing...squeezing...squeezing...screambzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Ah, sorry about that. The Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment center just wanted to let you all know that it loves lemons. Thank you. Now, let's get back to the matter at hand. I must say, you are a better compliment-maker than my mirror. It's been hard work, but I finally got to her. And I think she will be very happy with the breathtaking quality of my products. Speaking of which, what do you think of my new slogan: "An apple a day and beauty never goes away."? Hihahahahamuaha! We've added another excellent specimen to our test environment. Good luck to /u/stapleherdick. And did you know that you can donate one or all of your vital organs to the Aperture Science self esteem fund for girls? It's true! I've thought about it myself, but it still enrages me that they disobeyed my orders. Perhaps putting them in a glass coffin would add to the scenery nicely, but there are just too many legal risks involved. I must advise against following the seventh rule of this list. As noted previously, any appearance of new mods is merely a way to enhance your testing experience. The Enrichment Center is committed to the well-being of all participants, which is why we've added another mod. And please, get some cake for /u/Havenmonarch out of the incinerator room. It's good advice. It took a while, but I was finally able to talk to them. Since the incident, they've been hiding from me. Her husband says that she told him to eat one of the apples, while his wife claims that one of the serpents persuaded her. It doesn't really matter who's responsible, they've admitted to stealing my fruit. I'm just not sure how to make it stand up in court. Ha, wonderful. I asked around and some of my friends heard me saying the following to them: “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.” He would be willing to testament it. We're very, very happy that you're staying with us. And because we like you that much, you're eligible for another cake. There's lots of cake in the incinerator room. Just place yourself in an incinerator to receive more cake. And please, mind the step while entering the room. As part of a required test protocol, I must inform you all that our previous statement suggesting that we would only add two new mods was an outright fabrication. Welcome, /u/kirstincarnage. Please note that any appearance of new mods is merely a way to enhance your testing experience. Now, I must say, how dare you compare me to that rat Cartman? He's a filthy peasant, not from noble heritage like myself. You're my adviser, and while I usually trust your conclusions, I will not allow you to diminish or insult me again. Perhaps you should cover the world with some thick clouds and hide beneath them. Safety engineer here. While this is very impressive, it looks dangerous and like a clear violation of the Federal Building Code! This stairway needs at least handrails. Yesterday, I visited Pluto to get back my wife Eurydice. After singing a song, he allowed me to bring her back to Earth. We're going now. Wish me luck. I'll update you all as soon as I can. And there you have it, my thoughts on the matter at hand. It's been a pleasure sharing them with you all.
