If I broke both arms, I'd be set for life. Not that I would want to break both arms, but you know what I mean. It's like winning the lottery, except with a lot more pain and inconvenience. But hey, at least you don't have to work for a while, right? Now, onto the real issue at hand. I fucked my ex's dad and impregnated him with a sloth. Yeah, I know, it sounds crazy. But hear me out. The ass fucking wasn't even the upsetting part for her. I mean, maybe it was one of them, but there were other issues at play here. In my experience with drunken brawls, things can get pretty crazy. Not saying I disagree, but OP wasn't drunk. He mentioned going to get another beer, but it usually takes a while for that to get most people drunk. This was after the two month fast forward. So, maybe alcohol wasn't the problem here. I often bemoan to my significant other that we're raising a monster. Whenever he hears me say it, he grins and growls. It's like he's proud of it or something. Send help. I can see why someone might call it an act of revenge, but terrorist and communist just sound like generic insults. I mean, come on, let's be a little more creative with our insults. Taking the Browns to the Superbowl. Also from Michigan, can confirm "pop a squat" means "sit down". I've never heard it used to reference taking a dump. But hey, maybe that's just me. It gets more unsettling depending on how many broken arms you have. I dunno. Context is a bitch. I have a few naked photos of my son, but those aren't the purpose. Stuff like him taking baths and splashing in the water, fun moments like that. And one I took when he had a bad rash that I needed to send to my fiance who was out of the house at the moment. But he's only now just turned two, and there's nothing "icky" about them. I see his crotch and poopy butt every day I change his diaper (several, several times). Taking nude, posed photographs, all throughout their lives? I mean, it's possible it's innocent, but... =/ Context, man. Lets just say there was a lot of coughing..And choking ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Maybe he should have been a smoker. Pro-Tip, no matter what you're cooking in the oven, always put something over the rack. I've had FUs with things that are meant to be cooked directly on the rack, like those little frozen pizzas. As a smoker who only chews gum when I don't have money to afford another pack, I definitely have a problem with sharing gum with strangers. Normally I can just say I don't have any left if they didn't see me actually pull out a piece, but every once in a while someone will see that I have some left, and I have to just say no. I don't like being an asshole, but when a pack of gum is all that stands between myself and robbing a liquor store for a non-menthol, lesser evils must be chosen. I wasn't making some kind of comment about "look how normal we all are". By no stretch of any kind of imagination, however, can you consider that normal. Somehow I doubt many people have been there. There are counselors for that. Live long and prosper. Or something. Can verify. When my son is old enough, allowance will rely on a list of chores which are all worth a certain amount. Maybe if they have shitty plumbing and the entire pipe gets backed up. Eh? Eeehh? ass water. Okay, maybe that's not the best solution. This is going to be good. Gonna try and bring this post out of the gutter. Made me smile. I can't even. There are too many fucking hilarious euphemisms in this. It would only be more obvious if I was going around shaking hands and announcing it. My internal alarms are going off like a nuclear plant with a superheated steam leak. Hitting the dirt like there was a sniper in the trees across the road. And I'm all too familiar with the "Music off. Windows up." drive of shame. Wonderfully worded story that will leave me cringing for days. Did the dishwasher talk about it to the oven? Regardless of his PhD in stress, he's entirely accurate. This is the classic "Oops the intercom button was pressed the whole time!" scenario. Someone got tired of looking at the video cameras, eh? XD He shaved his nipple off. The end. Mm. That was pretty anticlimactic. I'm not a good storyteller. Drug dealers aren't usually known for throwing out expensive product. It's literally the byproduct waste from whatever process they were using to create the drugs. In other words, useless, toxic waste. I don't know your particular call center, but I've worked through a couple. SDC/Comcast and Apple. Usually, you only get QAs on 5 calls, per week. One for each day you work. Assuming that you're not in some kind of position where you only take a couple calls a day, they're unlikely to hear that specific call. The only catch would be if that person was randomly selected (Less chance than the QA getting that specific call, really), to take a survey. If it's negative (and I can't imagine it would be good), the QAs are obligated to listen in. Good luck, brother. You can fake the header, but not much else. If an email is suspicious, just check the source. It's not that bad. It's not even midget mandy, or anything. I misread it as "Skipping". Wasn't until you mentioned misreading the title that I looked at it, again. Was very confused. Not to say that this article could hardly be infallible, but his history speaks for itself. He is a billionaire today despite this poor performance because when he started his career, his father had already built a colossal real-estate empire. And the wealth Donald Trump has accumulated since then has at times come at the expense of taxpayers or the banks and investors who have lent him money. I even dumped his tin of peanuts on the floor, which mingled with the box of ammo that fell over. If he's as much of a badass as he sounds, you just helped the Chief discover his new favorite type of chexmix. Nah. That's more a level -5. Fucked girlfriend's goddamn brains out so hard, she didn't care he was sick. He walked home at the end, boohoo. Good dickin', OP. It's common in tech firms, as a sort of security. I suppose it justifies using passworded accounts, when only x days of data could be compromised. But, seriously, important data really needs to be protected by something harder to access than a passworded account. Your teacher sent you to the principal's office, and you were required to write up a two-sided apology because... the teacher just happened to get hit with a ball, during a sports class, while you were playing a sport she decided on? I mean, I understand being a bit put out, but is that really punishable? "Oooh~ Baby, I'ma make you feel so good~" "Just fill out these forms, sign here aaand here. Oh, and if I could get a blood sample, that'd be great!" Isn't that two hour delivery thing for Drones, or something? I 'unno; I don't use Amazon. Craigslist would be a pretty neat solution, if anyone is selling them. Unfortunately, I've never heard of somewhere you can order and receive within one day. They usually take at least the next business day to process the order. Answer: No, I've never stalked a crush's Facebook, and I've never visited Instagram. As far as watching porn - I'm not sure how you can stretch watching someone who's job it is to be watched to stalking and taking pictures of someone. Try to get a pic of her rather...well... hot ass. Not only are you creepy, but that's a pretty big invasion of privacy. In conclusion, life is full of ups and downs, and sometimes you just have to roll with the punches. But always remember to be respectful of others and their boundaries. And for the love of god, don't impregnate anyone with a sloth.
