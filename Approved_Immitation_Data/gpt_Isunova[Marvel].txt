Hey there! I couldn't help but notice your post and I just had to chime in. You mentioned some great graphic novels, but I have to say, you're missing out on one of the best ones out there: Uncanny X-Force by Remender. This series features some of the most iconic characters in the Marvel universe, including Deadpool, Wolverine, and Psylocke, just to name a few. But what makes this series stand out is the stunning artwork and captivating writing. The storyline is intense and involves Apocalypse and his horsemen, leading to a massive cosmic battle. It's dark, brooding, and refreshingly different from the kid-friendly takes that comics have been doing lately. Trust me, you won't regret giving this series a read. When it comes to music, I have to say that my favorites are Kid A and In Rainbows by Radiohead. These albums are simply masterpieces and showcase the band's incredible range and talent. I also love Hail to the Thief, but I know it's not as popular among fans. It's always good to know that there are other people out there who appreciate these albums as much as I do! As for comics, there are two main Marvel universes: 616 (the main Marvel universe) and 1610 (the Ultimate universe). While they currently don't exist due to recent events in the Secret Wars story, they're still worth checking out. Which series you want to read really depends on what you're looking for. For example, if you're a fan of the Inhumans, I highly recommend checking out the Son of M series, followed by Silent War, Secret Invasion: Inhumans, and War of Kings. These series really showcase the Inhumans' interactions with the rest of the Marvel universe and feature some epic battles between Black Bolt and the Avengers. If you're a fan of the Fantastic Four, you'll want to start with issue #570 and read all the way up to #588, after which the story shifts over to FF 1-11. Then, F4 starts at #600 and goes to #611, while FF starts at #12 and goes to #23. These are meant to be read at the same time, so be sure to follow the handy reading order if you're feeling a bit confused. And trust me, it's definitely worth finishing this series. The payout is very satisfying and sets up events for later stories like Avengers, New Avengers, and Secret Wars. Plus, you'll get to see Dr. Doom do some of the most badass things you've ever seen. Speaking of Dr. Doom, he's fantastic in F4/FF, as you'll see later on. You can also check out Triumph and Torment, which shows Doom and Dr. Strange partnering up to go to Hell to rescue his mother's soul. It's a bit older, but definitely worth a read. And finally, I have to mention Hawkeye. While I know not everyone is a fan, I've heard so many good things about the run and I can't wait to check it out myself. I've also been having trouble sleeping lately, so maybe this movie you mentioned will be the cure. Thanks for the recommendation, OP! I could go on and on about my favorite comics and graphic novels, but I'll leave it at that for now. Just know that there are so many amazing stories out there just waiting to be discovered. Happy reading!
