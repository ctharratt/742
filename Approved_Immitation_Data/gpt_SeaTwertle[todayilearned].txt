I mean, seriously, have you heard about this charity? It's insane. You get to kill kids and then go to heaven. I know, I know, it sounds crazy, but hear me out. This woman, she's a genius. She's found a way to make people feel good about doing something terrible. And I donate to this charity every once in a while, because I love the idea of what she's doing. And have you seen those 3D movies? I mean, what's the point? If you're so annoying that you get assassinated, you deserved it. Thank you, Coca Cola marketing team. But seriously, what if the government started that fad knowing this, and by reverse psychology, are tapping into people's thoughts at a greater frequency? It's a scary thought, but it could be true. And don't even get me started on cheerleading. It's brutal. I mean, I like cilantro, but not too much. Such is life. And Barney? Ugh, don't even get me started. I guess 12 years of it would be enough to break anyone. But let's talk about something more interesting, like neopets. That game was dope. And I feel like they could have made Mario a huge celebrity in Ralph's world, with a paparazzi, security, and hired a suave Italian guy to voice him. And speaking of crazy people, I get the feeling that Walt Disney was a bit of a nut. And have you ever tried to make changes in your parents' neighborhood? It's near impossible. There's always that one person who insists any changes will drive down housing prices. It's frustrating, but what can you do? But let's talk about something more important, like my cat. I swear, no matter how clean the water bowl is, or whether or not the water is purified, she insists on drinking out of the fish bowls above the cabinets. It's like she's trying to drive me crazy. And have you heard about Pluto? It has a revolution of 248 years. And yet, we haven't even made half a revolution from its discovery to our having high definition pictures of it. It's mind-blowing. But let's talk about something more serious, like suicide attempts. Did you know that when someone cuts their wrists in a suicide attempt, they actually feel calm and collected? It's a scary thought, but it's true. And I'm a little upset that no one else is talking about this. And don't even get me started on that scene in Titanic. The problem isn't that they couldn't both fit on the door. The problem is that when Jack tried to get on, the door couldn't hold both of their weights. It's simple physics, people. But let's talk about something more interesting, like horror movies. I mean, what's with all these slasher flicks? Where's the actual horror? It's like they're trying to scare us with gore instead of actual fear. And have you ever heard of the Hope Diamond? It's just a diamond loaded with impurities, and yet people are willing to pay millions for it. It's crazy. And it's no secret that diamonds are overpriced, but people still buy them for Christmas or Valentine's Day. It's like they don't care about the facts. But let's talk about something more personal, like my superstitions. I firmly believe that good things are always followed by bad things. For example, I was super happy about my first car, which was totaled before I could make the first payment. And last week, I had two amazing days in a row, and the next day my dad died. It may just be circumstance, but it keeps me from taking anything for granted. And don't even get me started on my cat again. I swear, she's trying to drive me crazy. But at least we have a way of communicating. When I'm reading or something, I'll look at her and blink slowly. And when she blinks back, I know we're still in good terms. But let's talk about something more exciting, like a Space Race 2. I mean, how cool would that be? And speaking of cool, I'm eating Froot Loops right now. Take that, Saddam. And have you ever wondered about the origins of coffee? Could it be that it actually has none of the effects that we think it does, and these are just random medical outcomes of their studies? It's a possibility. But let's talk about something more important, like the atrocities of the Holocaust. It's a major event in history, but there have been multiple cases of millions of deaths in a time period that overshadow it. It's important to remember all of these tragedies, not just one. And don't even get me started on slaves. I mean, seriously, who lets their slaves inside? It's just not right. But let's end on a positive note, like the fact that we live in a world where we can have high definition pictures of Pluto. It's far out, man.
