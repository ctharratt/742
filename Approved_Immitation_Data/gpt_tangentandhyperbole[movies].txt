Alright, let's talk about Deadpool. The movie that broke all the rules and shattered all the expectations. The movie that proved that superhero movies don't have to be all about saving the world and being a shining beacon of hope. The movie that showed us that sometimes, it's okay to be a little bit naughty. But let's not forget where it all started. It started with a leaked test footage that was never meant to see the light of day. It started with Ryan Reynolds, the man who was born to play Deadpool, fighting tooth and nail to get this movie made. It started with a studio that was hesitant to take a risk on a character that was known for breaking the fourth wall and being irreverent. And yet, here we are. Deadpool is a cultural phenomenon. It's a movie that has spawned countless memes, merchandise, and even a sequel. It's a movie that has made Ryan Reynolds a household name and a hero to comic book fans everywhere. It's a movie that has shown us that sometimes, the underdog can come out on top. But let's not forget the other movies that paved the way for Deadpool. Let's talk about Jeff Who Lives At Home, Wristcutters, and The Life Aquatic. These are all movies that share the same irreverent spirit as Deadpool. They're movies that are more concerned with creating a unique aesthetic and feel than with telling a cohesive narrative. They're movies that take risks and push boundaries. And let's not forget the other characters that make up the Deadpool universe. There's Bob, the faceless minion who somehow manages to survive Deadpool's rampage. There's Cable, the time-traveling mutant who is set to team up with Deadpool in the sequel. And of course, there's Colossus, the CGI character who manages to steal the show with his earnestness and sincerity. But let's not forget the other villains that have graced the screen in superhero movies. There's Loki, the god of mischief who manages to be both charming and menacing. There's Ultron, the robotic villain who is more concerned with destroying humanity than with being a three-dimensional character. And there's Winter Soldier, the brainwashed assassin who is revealed to be a good guy in disguise. And let's not forget the other actors who have played superheroes. There's Idris Elba, who was wasted in a sidebit role as Heimdall in the Thor movies. There's Mickey Rourke, who played the villain in Iron Man 2 and managed to bring some depth to his character. And of course, there's Robert Downey Jr., who has become synonymous with the role of Iron Man and who has managed to make the character his own. But let's not forget the other movies that have influenced Deadpool. Let's talk about Snatch, the movie that features Brad Pitt doing an exaggerated version of the pikey speak. Let's talk about In Bruges, the movie that is a harder watch than Seven Psychopaths but is still worth the effort. And let's not forget the other movies that have pushed the boundaries of what a superhero movie can be, like The Dark Knight and Watchmen. But let's not forget the real hero of the Deadpool movie. It's not Ryan Reynolds, or the writers, or the director. It's the fans. It's the fans who demanded that this movie be made. It's the fans who supported it with their wallets and their enthusiasm. It's the fans who made this movie a success. And let's not forget the real message of Deadpool. It's not about being naughty or breaking the rules. It's about being true to yourself. It's about embracing your flaws and your quirks. It's about being unapologetically yourself, no matter what anyone else thinks. So let's raise a glass to Deadpool. To the movie that proved that sometimes, it's okay to be a little bit naughty. To the movie that showed us that sometimes, the underdog can come out on top. To the movie that reminded us that being true to yourself is the most important thing of all. Cheers.
