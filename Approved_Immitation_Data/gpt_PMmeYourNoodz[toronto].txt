Love thy neighbor. It's a simple concept, yet one that seems to elude many in our society today. We live in a world where people are quick to judge and even quicker to hate. We see it in the way we treat the homeless, in the way we talk about those who are different from us, and in the way we interact with our neighbors. I've never seen a hobo drink from a jar, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. Maybe I just haven't been looking hard enough. Or maybe, as some have suggested, I only know fancy hobos. But what does that even mean? Are there really different classes of homeless people? And if so, why do we feel the need to categorize them? The truth is, we should be treating all people with kindness and respect, regardless of their social status. We should be helping those in need, not judging them. And we should be doing it because it's the right thing to do, not because we want something in return. Keeps your money. Wants your money again next year. That's kind of a tautology, isn't it? Of course, if everyone wants something, then other people are going to want it too. That's just common sense. But does that mean we should always give in to our desires? Should we always be chasing after the next big thing, even if it means sacrificing our values and principles? I don't think so. I think we need to learn to be content with what we have, to appreciate the simple things in life, and to focus on building meaningful relationships with those around us. Because at the end of the day, that's what really matters. This city is void of good art? That's simply not true. Sure, there may be some areas that are lacking in artistic expression, but that doesn't mean the entire city is devoid of creativity. In fact, there are countless artists and performers in this city who are doing amazing work every day. And while it's true that not everyone will appreciate or understand their art, that doesn't mean it's not valuable. Art has the power to inspire, to challenge, and to transform us. It can help us see the world in a new light and connect us to our fellow human beings in ways that nothing else can. So let's not dismiss the importance of art in our lives. Let's celebrate the artists and performers who are making a difference in our city, and let's support them in any way we can. Now, let's talk about marijuana. With the recent legalization of cannabis in Canada, many people are wondering what the future holds for this industry. And while some may be excited about the prospect of new products and services, others are concerned about the potential negative effects of widespread marijuana use. But here's the thing: the big corporations have already been planning for this for a long time. They know exactly how they're going to farm, process, package, and market their products. And they're way ahead of the game. So while some may be worried about the impact of legalized marijuana, the truth is that it's already here. And it's up to us to decide how we want to approach this new reality. Cops will just badger the girl? That's a pretty bold statement. And one that's not based on any real evidence. The truth is, we don't know how the police will handle this situation. But what we do know is that we need to treat all people with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or circumstances. And that means standing up for those who are being unfairly targeted or mistreated. It means speaking out against injustice and advocating for change. Because that's what it means to be a good neighbor. It seems like this guy is just telling the media about this story now to get his name out there. But why does that matter? If he has something important to say, shouldn't we be listening? And if he's trying to raise awareness about an issue that's important to him, shouldn't we be supporting him? We need to stop focusing on the messenger and start paying attention to the message. Because at the end of the day, that's what really matters. Union is a train station. It wouldn't be a festival otherwise! That's a good point. And it's a reminder that we need to embrace the unique character and history of our city. We need to celebrate our landmarks and cultural institutions, and we need to preserve them for future generations. Because these are the things that make our city special. They're the things that bring us together and remind us of our shared history and identity. And they're the things that make us proud to call this city our home. 90 degrees equals "harsh"? That's news to me. But it's a reminder that we all experience the world in different ways. What may be comfortable for one person may be unbearable for another. And that's why we need to be mindful of each other's needs and preferences. We need to be willing to listen and learn from each other, and to respect each other's differences. Because that's what it means to be a good neighbor. The old houses give the city character? I couldn't agree more. There's something special about the old architecture and design of our city. It's a reminder of our history and our heritage, and it's a testament to the hard work and creativity of those who came before us. But that doesn't mean we should stop building new things. We need to find a balance between preserving our past and embracing our future. We need to be willing to innovate and create, while also honoring the traditions and values that make our city great. And that's a challenge we all need to embrace. In conclusion, we need to remember that we're all in this together. We need to treat each other with kindness and respect, and we need to work together to build a better future for ourselves and our city. So let's be good neighbors. Let's celebrate our differences and embrace our similarities. And let's work together to create a city that we can all be proud of.
