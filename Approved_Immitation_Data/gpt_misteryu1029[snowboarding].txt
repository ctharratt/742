Hey everyone, hope you're all doing well! I just wanted to share my recent snowboarding experiences with you all and get some input on a few things. First off, I just bought new bindings and I'm so excited to try them out on my next trip to Tahoe. I did some research online and found that most people say bindings are the second most important thing to buy after boots. Can someone help me justify this? I mean, I understand the importance of having good bindings for safety and control, but why are they ranked higher than other gear like jackets or pants? Speaking of Tahoe, I just booked my first snowboarding trip to Kirkwood and I couldn't be more excited. I've been to Heavenly before and the snow conditions were amazing, so I'm hoping for the same at Kirkwood. I'll be bringing my K2 WWW jib board, which I absolutely love for hitting boxes and rails in the park. It's not the best for jumps, but it's perfect for my style of riding. I also wanted to share a tip for those of you looking for cheap lift tickets. Check Craigslist! I found Squaw tickets for only $50, which is a steal. And if you're looking for updates on Tahoe weather conditions, I highly recommend checking out tahoeweatherdiscussion.com. It's been a great resource for me. Now, let's talk about park features. I've ridden at Northstar and Heavenly, but I'm curious about other resorts in the area. Does anyone know if Mammoth Mountain has better park features than Tahoe resorts? And what about Northstar? I rode with Bay Area Ski Bus last week and had a blast, but I'm wondering if the parks there are more suited for intermediate or advanced riders. Speaking of Bay Area Ski Bus, I'm planning on riding with them again soon. I picked them up in Sunnyvale at 4am last time and decided to just stay up, which was a bad idea. But it was totally worth it for the amazing day of riding. I'm thinking about trying Alpine Meadows this time, but are there any other buses that go there? And finally, I wanted to share a tip for those of you just starting out with jumps. When you go off the jump, you'll have a natural tendency to lean back, which will make you fall right on your ass. So just remember to keep your weight centered and evenly distributed. And don't worry, you'll get the hang of it eventually. I always wonder if you get dizzy after doing all those spins continuously in a row though... Anyway, that's all for now. Thanks for reading and I hope to see some of you out on the slopes soon!
