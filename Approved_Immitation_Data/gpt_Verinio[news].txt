Oh boy, where do I even begin? That excuse is like a punch to the face, seriously. And wait, are you also Mexican? Why did you even bring up medieval times in the first place? I mean, even in our most unfree political times, we were never insane enough to not punish traitors. Are you saying agents of the crown didn't abuse their power? Of course they did, as well as any other oppressive regime throughout history. But let's talk about meritocracy for a second, because that's where it's at. People don't look back wistfully at the dark ages for a reason. Just saying, but European and Western history is a history of monarchies. Just 100 years ago, monarchy was the name of the game and they played more than just a ceremonial role. If he was a cop under Plantagenet protection, he'd probably be safe and up to way worse shit. Even the most oppressive regimes still have protests as a "check and balance". You know what was a very prominent theme in most stories from ancient times until very recently? Mistakes stay with you and it's one strike and you are out. If you kill someone, you are a killer, you don't get second chances. If you are a traitor, then it's off to the chopping block with you. Just look at Orpheus and Eurydice, this theme is literally everywhere. And to answer your question: I want him to never be able to work for the police again. In a medieval kingdom, he would get executed for that. Funny, considering in 10 years racist assholes like you will be sitting in re-education camps. They have as much right to be there as native Norwegians. THEY HAVE A RIGHT FOR ASYLUM! What you just said would transform Norway into Nazi Germany. They are traumatized by war and oppression. We need to educate them and show them how life is different in the West. We need to give them a comfortable life. After all they've been through, they deserve much better. I think people like you should experience what it's like to be tortured in prison and your family as well, maybe then you'll know what it's like to go through that. And in all honesty, insane right-wing racist lunatics like you... I wouldn't shed a tear if you were actually tortured in prison. People like you are the worst. You have done nothing to deserve to live in your country. The refugees went through so much more danger to get here and they are working so hard. They are such hard-working people. After all, the population is declining, we have too many old people, frankly we need them more than they need us. We should be so fucking thankful for them. They are the greatest opportunity for our country. Who is going to pay your pension? It's the children of the children of the current refugees that are now settling in. You fucking racist piece of shit. There is a term "Volksverhetzung" which is basically racist rabble-rousing and it's illegal to do that in Germany. I wish I could fucking sue you over that. I can't believe Reddit is being this racist, it used to be different. It's really fucking insane how this is still allowed to happen. IT professionals are going to be very surprised how their field is going to change in their lifetime. Say hello to regulation, my friends. Well, he isn't going to get promoted anymore. I can see that happening under both Democrats and Republicans. I guess we could send you guys some more dildos though. You're being tax evaders though, you missed to pay the gift tax. Looks like you'll join us in prison, now top bank, lower bank, or share? :) And any legitimate counterpoint you just dismiss and rant about something totally unrelated. Sounds like you in all honesty, since you compare the Rangers to ISIS and killers. And now you are purposefully derailing the conversation. No one is talking about killing people, that is a very bad argument, because the Rangers didn't hurt anybody, unlike the Black Lives Matter thugs, but they are your heroes right? What absolves the government of their crimes? Why should I worry about a few Rangers if the government is the biggest criminal? Did I miss something? You know as well as I do that if they started to kill people, their hideout would immediately be stormed by the military. Kinda Poe's law here, not sure if you are a troll or actually serious. The worst these few Rangers can do? Take over a federal building without hurting a single person (something Black Lives Matter can't do and they are the "good guys"). What's the worst the government can and currently does? Naming war just as an example, even the likes of you can agree. We both kinda took the bait, to be honest. Have you ever considered that the government might be breaking the law here? Do you ever think that you have a bias against the Rangers in this case? Do you ever think it can be right to be convicted for the same crime twice, when you already served one year in prison and are in danger of having your farm confiscated, which has been in your family for hundreds of years? You should be shot in the head. How can you support these obviously racist, Southern, Republican fascists? Ughhh... like the place should just be bombed, everyone who is there makes himself guilty of terrorism by association. Fuck, I hate my parents so fucking much. Because they didn't want to take it in the ass and have their lands confiscated. The guy in question actually already did one year in jail and was now supposed to go back there for the same "crime" he was already convicted of, but this time he would face terrorism charges. Basically, it's the government wanting to take away their land, the family possessed for generations. It's the age-old story of an abusive bureaucrat abusing the law to ruin a family/king burning down a forest and some houses to make room for his summer palace. The fact that people identify more with the faceless bureaucrat and the government in this case shows really how deep we have fallen and how crazy divided America is. Fucking identity politics. Also, anyone who leaves or attempts to enter the compound should be arrested on site. You are fucking crazy. We don't even restrict movement to countries we are at war with because of freedom of speech and the freedom of the media, but just like that, your hatred tunneled by identity politics on the "right" tricked you into wanting to restrict basic human rights. I can't put it in words how disgusting what you just said is to me. I find that snarky attitude against those Rangers quite disheartening. Did none of you guys even spend five minutes to learn the backstory of all this? This is the peasants siding with the king who wants to burn down a forest and some houses for his summer hunting residence. This makes me lose faith in humanity. Wew, quite unusual to call people statists and at the same time call Snowden a traitor. Make sure they didn't feast on human flesh on sacred Native American mountain.
