Yo, what's up guys? Life is good, man. I'm feeling grateful for everything I have. I've got some awesome friends, no drama at school, and my parents are the best. Plus, I just got my hands on a sick new camera - a Nikon D3300. It's been a long time coming, but I finally got my hands on it. My report card is decent, but I know I could do better if I didn't procrastinate so much and actually got some sleep. I've also got some rare Pepes, so that's pretty cool. But let's talk about something that's been on my mind lately - the International Baccalaureate program. I'm in my first year of IB, and let me tell you, it's no joke. SL Math and HL Chem are kicking my ass, but I'm determined to make it through. I'm curious, what were your IB subjects and what was your score? Congrats to those who have already made it through, because IB is tiring, at least for me. But enough about me, let's talk about something that's been bugging me lately. It's this whole socialist vs. capitalist debate. Now, I'm not going to tell you to change your views, because that would be ridiculous. But I do think that family traditions should not be the sole influence as to who you support politically. Instead, you should actually look at the policies and see if you agree with them. I personally support Bernie Sanders, but I know he's not the perfect candidate. However, I think he's a lot better than some of the other options out there. I mean, come on, having a database of all the Muslims in the country? That's just ridiculous. And don't even get me started on some of the other things that have been said and done. But hey, that's just my opinion. I'm curious to hear what you guys think. Do you think family traditions should play a role in who you support politically? Or do you think it's more important to look at the policies and make an informed decision? Anyway, let's move on to something a little more lighthearted. Have you guys ever noticed when a girl wears overly long sleeves so only their fingers stick out? I don't know why, but I find it kind of cute. And speaking of cute, have you ever seen a nice stomach on a girl? Hnnnnngggg. Just take me. But seriously, let's talk about some cool things to do in New York City. If you're ever in the area, I highly recommend checking out the Museum of Natural History, Central Park, the Hall of Science, and the Bronx Zoo. And if you really want to see some cool sights, go to the bottom of the building at 432 Park Avenue and look up, or check out the Freedom Tower. And speaking of cool things, I'm from Bangladesh and I'm proud of it. It's always cool to see other people from my country on here. And hey, if you're ever in the area, hit me up and we can grab some food or something. But let's get back to the topic at hand - IB. I know it can be tough, but here are some tips that have helped me out. When you're speaking in public, try looking at people's foreheads instead of their eyes. It'll look like you're making eye contact without actually having to look directly at their eyes. And if you're nervous, chew gum up until you're presenting. Your brain will assume that you wouldn't be eating if you were in danger, so it'll trick you into staying calm. And most importantly, don't think about yourself while speaking. The less you notice your own uncomfortableness, the less worried you'll be. And finally, let's talk about something that's been on my mind lately. I've noticed that a lot of people on here are really attractive, and it's making me feel a little insecure. I mean, I'm not the ugliest person in the world, but I'm definitely not a model either. But you know what? That's okay. We're all unique and beautiful in our own way. So let's embrace our differences and celebrate what makes us special. In conclusion, life is good. IB is tough, but we'll make it through. And let's all remember to embrace our differences and celebrate what makes us unique. Thanks for listening, guys.
