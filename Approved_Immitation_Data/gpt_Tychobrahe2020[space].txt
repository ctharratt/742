Pfft, my telescope could take a better picture than that. /s Well not now, but perhaps in a hundred years when there are more advanced satellites. Satellites, especially ones that no longer function, are just as dangerous as junk. IIRC there is other junk in geosynchronous or similar orbits. Two satellites collided some years ago. IIRC it was a US defense sat and a commercial sat. Stuff in geosynchronous orbits will stay up for eons. It wouldn't be the first or even second time someone has been hit (but not killed.) I read many years ago that the odds of being hit were only 1 in 10 billion, yet there have been more than a few known cases of this. The one thing I wanted to know most of is, is this satellite in a polar orbit, in other words, a spy satellite. The news never said. I accidentally clicked your name and looked at your post history... why were you downvoted four times for asking that perfectly reasonable question... the science subs can be irritating sometimes. That's why r/astronomy disabled downvotes a while back. I'm sick of people downvoting posts like this. This sub is so uptight. It's just a question. Why do you think alcohol has less effect than weed? Have you never smoked before? And obviously no one knows the answer because we have all sidestepped the question. They have an annoying answer for that too. Relativity is made up... Has it really been that long? My god. Unfortunately, that experiment would be highly unethical. We don't know for sure what would happen, but there is a possibility that the person would never be able to walk on Earth... The radiation would also lower the child's life expectancy, perhaps by a decade or more. We just don't know. He's brilliant. It's by far my favorite YouTube channel. You should check out his other videos. The part where he puts on the tin foil hat makes me laugh every time. He's also a Redditor, but his normal Reddit name is unknown. Tasty... in seriousness though, I probably would too. Just so I could say I was the first human to get stoned in space. A fire in an enclosed environment could be catastrophic. I would wager that someone has snuck alcohol aboard in the past, but no astronaut or cosmonaut would be dumb enough to ignite anything up there. Edibles on the other hand... it probably hasn't happened yet, but someday. The one thing he was wrong about is that most of these people are for real. It's just like the "fake" moon landing. Do they really give degrees in astrology, lol what "college" is that from? Not when we started the space race it wasn't, and orbital weapons platforms were certainly considered before and I'm sure after that treaty. It's not stupid for him to think of, it's not the best place to put an ICBM, but thoughts like that are what drove the space race. Putting ICBMs in orbit was certainly a goal at one point. I was really teasing, it just seemed odd to state something's weight in pounds on Mars and Kg on Earth. Anyways, most Americans who frequent this sub are fairly comfortable with metric. Some of us even try to convince our countrymen it's the superior system. Is it a heart or a butt? Jesus Chris man, did you work on the god damn mission? How do you know so much about it? Well done r/actuallysmart should be a thing. No, it was a season 2 episode called "A Matter of Time." Yeah, that was a good episode, although it does have one major flaw that they didn't explain away. If a star collapses into a black hole, it doesn't instantly have a stronger gravitational effect and wouldn't cause time dilation at the distance that planet was in the first place. But that would have nixed the whole premise of the episode, so they stayed as accurate as they could and taught a lot of people that time dilation was a thing long before Interstellar came out. That is cool. I had heard that many years ago and forgotten it. Thanks for reminding me. Although the article doesn't say, they must have used an infrared telescope to be able to detect this planet because it would be impossible with visible light. Or it may actually be a brown dwarf, the article omits that important detail. In fact, the article omits a lot of details. Edit: it was an infrared telescope. It was the 2-micron all-sky survey, and here is a much better article. The star it orbits is a red dwarf. A planet could stay in orbit around our sun about 10 times farther out than that as long as we didn't get too close to another star. That's about 1 light-year. It would take millions of years to orbit though. I did the math on it once, and IIRC it was longer for one orbit than the amount of time since dinosaurs were the dominant species on Earth. A 1 light-year wide orbit would be disrupted at some point though over billions of years though. It would be MUCH brighter than any other star, and with a proper filter, you could easily make out that it was a disc through a telescope... assuming you didn't freeze to death that is. Yeah, they really respected the intelligence level of their audience. I just want to add that now that I've watched the whole episode, they also used meters per second to describe relative velocity, and best of all, without bothering to explain it, they were able to properly portray how you could hear knocking in a vacuum by putting your hand on something that was being knocked on.  At least he admitted it. Well, we can imagine in hundreds or thousands of years some technology might be developed that simulates the effect of gravity without rotation. People from certain countries like China, for example, would never be allowed to join due to national security concerns. But if you're from the UK, you have a shot. Later, with no explanation given, people walking on the asteroid in space suits pull gold visors down before walking into sunlight. That's a nice touch. WTF is this cosmic ray origin shit, and why doesn't lithium share the big bang tag? Hubble can see in infrared too, though not as far... If you can't understand why people call it Hubble's successor, that seems really strange. It's pretty obvious why. They will be able to make Webb's pictures look just as "pretty" as Hubble's because there is more than one wavelength it will be able to observe at. I'm not trying to be rude, but do you understand how colors work and why pictures from Hubble look the way they do? Do you know what a false-color image is and realize most pictures from Hubble fall into that category, including the one you linked? When I was 13, Sojourner was on Mars, and Hal-Bopp was in the sky and very clearly visible even near the Heart of LA. It was a good time to be into astronomy, and I'll never forget my first time seeing Mars. After Lucy Lawless, who played Xena, for anyone who doesn't know. Dysnomia can also be interpreted to mean "Bad Name" for the Pluto/Eris planet or not debacle, so it fits nicely for two reasons. I think if you plugged enough observations into a computer, you could get a good idea. Metallicity to astronomers means anything heavier than helium though. I'm not sure how much iron would cause an effect in a type F star.  In conclusion, space is a vast and mysterious place, and there is still so much we don't know. But with advancements in technology and continued exploration, we may one day unlock the secrets of the universe. Until then, let's keep asking questions and seeking answers.
