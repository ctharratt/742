I've been thinking a lot about the issue of British weapons being sold to Saudi Arabia and the potential for those weapons to be used in terrorist attacks. It's a tough issue because on one hand, we want to support British businesses and provide jobs for our people. But on the other hand, we don't want to contribute to the spread of terrorism and violence. Some people argue that if we don't sell weapons to Saudi Arabia, another nation will step in and do it instead. But that's not a good enough reason to continue selling weapons. We need to take responsibility for our actions and consider the potential consequences. I've read articles that show the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia as a strong ally against terrorism, but there are also proven cases of princes supporting terrorism. It's a complicated issue and one that requires careful consideration. Speaking of complicated issues, let's talk about wars. There are far more wars than are needed, and it's time for us to start questioning the reasons behind them. The Falklands War, for example, could be argued as unnecessary. But at the same time, it's important to consider the potential consequences of not taking action. It's a similar situation with Scottish independence. While I personally support the idea, I understand that there are valid arguments against it. But at the end of the day, if there's a popular mandate for it, we can't prevent a referendum without being undemocratic. And speaking of democracy, let's talk about the recent Brexit vote. I personally don't care either way, but I understand that there are valid reasons for both staying in the EU and leaving. It's important to consider the potential consequences of either decision and make an informed choice. But let's not forget about the issue of discrimination. It's unacceptable to tar all under 18s with the same brush as a bunch of chavs, just as it's unacceptable to discriminate against any group of people based on their religion or beliefs. And let's not forget about the issue of education. It's great that the Tories introduced a computer science GCSE to teach kids how to program, but it's also important to teach them critical thinking skills and how to question the world around them. And finally, let's talk about the issue of self-driving cars. While they may seem like a great idea, they're still years away from being a reality. We need to consider the potential consequences of relying on technology to do everything for us and ensure that we're not sacrificing safety for convenience. In conclusion, there are a lot of complicated issues in the world today, and it's important to consider all sides before making a decision. We need to take responsibility for our actions and ensure that we're not contributing to the spread of violence and discrimination. And most importantly, we need to question the world around us and never stop learning and growing.
