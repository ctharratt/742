Well, let me tell you, I've been around the block a few times and I've never seen Parmesan cheese for less than $3/lb. Maybe I'm just in a different market, but that seems like a steal to me. I mean, sure, it might be a hassle to go to a specialty store to get the real stuff, but it's worth it in my opinion. And let's be real, sometimes convenience wins out and I'll grab the shaker with the corn starch and other fillers. I know what I'm getting and I don't feel ripped off. Now, I remember someone saying that buying cheese and grating it yourself is cheaper, but I have to disagree. It's not cheaper, it's just not. And when I said that, they were like "well, yeah." I mean, what does that even mean? Are they agreeing with me or not? I'm confused. And don't even get me started on vetoes. I mean, sure, they can be used too often and make a governor or president look like a despot, but sometimes they're necessary. I remember the Governor of Montana going on a veto spree because he felt the laws were unjust and out of touch with the voters. He even used a branding iron to veto them. Now that's a boss move. But let's get back to cheese. I don't buy Parmesan in blocks, but other cheeses are never as cheap as the shaker things. And don't even get me started on sausages. Kroger makes their own sausages on site and let me tell you, there's a difference. Real sausage is so much better than that factory crap. Although, I did buy bleu cheese once and it was part mold. Like, what the heck? I'm not paying for mold, I'm paying for cheese! And apparently, there's cellulose in the shaker cheese, but who cares? It's non-toxic and doesn't add calories. Plus, we consumers clearly prefer the texture. Now, I heard someone talking about the castor sack and how it's in artificial vanilla too, but not where I live. The stuff in the shaker is under $3/lb, while real Parmesan is closer to $10/lb. And even pre-shredded mozzarella with corn starch is cheaper than a block of actual mozz. But hey, maybe we just live in different markets. And speaking of markets, did you hear about that politician who objected to using bulldozers to clear land for a runway because it meant fewer jobs? Like, seriously? We could also take away their shovels and create even more jobs, dumbass. Smart spending stimulates the economy far better than just spending more money. But let's talk about something more serious. People go to jail for "fucking accidents". That's why the charge "vehicular manslaughter" exists. It wasn't murder, but due to gross negligence, someone died. And that's just how it works. I mean, did you see that video of the car accident? Excessive speed made it so that the driver couldn't see far enough ahead of him and the car he hit had no way of knowing they'd be t-boned. If he was going slower, the accident might have been survivable or even avoided entirely. And don't even get me started on cities that rely too heavily on tickets for revenue. It's like they're ripping off travelers passing through. Sure, spending does stimulate the economy, but smart spending does it far better. And let's not forget about those sausage casings. They're disgusting if you think about it, but if you don't, they're tasty and wonderful. In conclusion, Parmesan cheese is worth the hassle, real sausage is better than factory crap, and smart spending stimulates the economy far better than just spending more money. And let's all remember to drive safely and avoid excessive speed.
