So, it seems that the topic of American foreign policy is once again at the forefront of political discourse. As someone who is deeply invested in the future of this country, I find it disheartening that there are those who would rather engage in fear-mongering and conspiracy theories than have a rational discussion about the issues at hand. Let's start with the idea that there will be no change in American foreign policy. While it is true that there are certain aspects of our foreign policy that are unlikely to change regardless of who is in office, to suggest that there will be no difference between a Democratic and Republican president is simply untrue. The fact is that the two parties have vastly different approaches to foreign policy, and those differences will be reflected in the policies they enact. As for the idea that the GOP field would be even worse both domestically and abroad, I couldn't agree more. The current crop of Republican candidates is a frightening bunch, with policies that range from the absurd to the downright dangerous. It is no wonder that so many people are turning to the Democratic Party for leadership. Now, let's talk about Hillary Clinton. I know that there are those who view her as some sort of evil mastermind, but the reality is that she is a highly accomplished public servant who has spent her entire career fighting for the rights of women and children. To suggest that she is somehow responsible for all of the world's problems is not only ridiculous, it is insulting to the millions of people whose lives she has touched in a positive way. I am a progressive on most issues, but I am also a realist. I know that there is no such thing as a perfect candidate, and that sometimes we have to make compromises in order to achieve our goals. That is why I am supporting Bernie Sanders in the primary, but if he loses, I will gladly vote for Hillary Clinton. I would rather have Obama 2.0 than any of the GOP candidates. As for the idea that Hillary is a Bush-era Republican, I have to say that this is simply not true. While it is true that she has been more hawkish on foreign policy than some progressives would like, her voting record is more liberal than either Obama's or Biden's. To suggest that she is somehow a conservative is simply not supported by the facts. Now, let's talk about the birther rumors. It is true that there were some supporters of Hillary Clinton who spread rumors about Barack Obama's birthplace during the 2008 campaign. However, to suggest that this was some sort of orchestrated campaign by the Clinton campaign is simply not supported by the evidence. The fact is that there were a few rogue supporters who engaged in this behavior, and the Clinton campaign quickly repudiated it. As for the idea that the email came from someone on the Clinton staff, there is simply no evidence to support this claim. The burden of proof is on those who make the assertion, and so far, no one has been able to provide any evidence to support it. Finally, let's talk about the idea that anyone who would vote for Hillary Clinton is daft. This is simply not true. While I understand that there are those who have legitimate concerns about her record and her policies, to suggest that anyone who supports her is somehow stupid or uninformed is insulting and counterproductive. In conclusion, I would like to say that I am deeply invested in the future of this country, and I believe that the Democratic Party is the best hope we have for a better future. While there are certainly issues that need to be addressed within the party, I believe that we can work together to achieve our goals and make this country a better place for all of us.
