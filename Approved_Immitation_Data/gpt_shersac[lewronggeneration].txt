Yo, what's up guys? It's been a pretty chill week for me. Winter holidays are just around the corner and I still need to buy gifts for my family. I'm thinking of getting my mom a nice scarf and my dad a new watch. As for my little sister, I have no idea what to get her. Maybe some makeup or a cute dress? I don't know, I'll figure it out. On another note, my final day of school is in 100 days. It's crazy to think that I'll be leaving this place soon. I think I'll miss it, but going to university in a different city will probably be decent too. I'm excited to start a new chapter in my life. So, I was listening to some music the other day and even though I don't really like Savas, I have to agree that "Das Urteil" is a pretty dope track. And speaking of music, have you guys heard of J Dilla and Monty Python? They're two of the best instrumental hip hop artists and comedy groups, respectively. It's a shame they both died way too early. Oh, and I saw this dude on the internet who upvoted himself 70 times. Like, what's the point of that? Did he make a second account just to do that? And where's his selfie at? I mean, if you're gonna be that desperate for attention, at least show your face. Also, why do people think you have to be cool to drink alcohol? Here in Germany, pretty much everybody regardless of "coolness" seems to drink. It's not a big deal. On a more serious note, I've been having some skin problems lately. I think I need to get some skin care products or go to a doctor if it gets too bad. It really helped for some friends of mine. Congratz to my boy who just got a car. If you're the first one among your friends, have fun being the designated driver. Otherwise, just remember to not drive drunk and not waste your fuel. But yo, can we talk about how Telekom is treating its customers? I've been without wifi for almost 6 weeks now and I'm slowly going insane. It's not even because I have no internet, but rather because of the way they're treating us. They were supposed to send somebody to check my router, but each time no one was coming. Instead, they were leaving a message that they rang the door and apparently no one opened. I was at home each time and either me or my dad had to cancel some meeting to be at home and open the door for them. Adding on to that, they're treating customers based on their money. Normal customers are in the lowest tier and they can buy their way up to be "treated" faster. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get it off my mind. And speaking of getting things off my mind, I have this friend who's been crushing on this girl for a while now. He's too scared to ask her out, but I keep telling him to just go for it. Maybe they'll become friends when they're drunk. Who knows? Oh, and to the dude who needs to shave himself, go do it. And take care of your sister too. And keep your hair the way it is, it looks good on you. So, I saw this video of teens reacting to Kylie Minoise and it was hilarious. They had no idea what was going on. But seriously, why do people think that teenagers don't know or watch Monty Python? Or J Dilla for that matter? And can we talk about how homecoming is like? I've never been to one, but it seems like a big deal. And how do you survive it without being able to drink alcohol? I mean, I guess you could just dance and have fun without it, but still. Anyway, I had to write two exams this week (History and English) and both went reasonably well. I also went to a birthday party of a friend on Friday and it went reasonably well too. Thank god I have autumn holidays now. And finally, can we talk about how rock is not dead? Sure, there may not be as many iconic songs as there used to be, but there are still plenty of bands out there keeping it alive. Queens of the Stone Age, Arcade Fire, Weezer, DFA1979, Radiohead, mbv, and all those other indie/post-rock/dream pop/shoegaze/"alt rock" artists are proof of that. And even though Jack White complains that there's nothing like The White Stripes anymore, he just got a no. 1 album. So there. Alright, that's all for now. Peace out.
