Yo, thanks for the guidance, man. I just needed to make sure I wasn't totally screwing things up. But now that I know I'm good, let's do this thing! Big ups to you for looking out for me. I'm about to write a paper on 'Papa's waltz', so wish me luck.  Oh, and I totally get the italian sonnet now. Check out what I've got so far, it's pretty hilarious. Reddit's not loving the formatting, so give me a sec to fix it up.  A. Yo, lovely grain ma-ker, how doth thee do it? My wife's like, "What the heck, dude?" B. Hulling grains, keepin' the pearl kernel in tact, She's out there gatherin' the grain, straight up. a. Stalks reaped from the field of sedum acre, That's where she gets it from, y'all. b. Almighty goddess, she's got her tract prepared, She's gettin' that rice ready for my swallowin' tract, heh. C. Gird the grain, starch retreat, boil inert, Gotta gather the grain, wash the starch out, then let it boil slow and easy. D. Brine the brew, spice the pearl, tin; then unfurl, Salt that rice, add some spices, and stir it up while it's cookin'. c. Bib thy trunk almighty, fore thy subvert, Get me ready for my meal before I destroy it. d. Goddess thou hast cooked thee a divine pearl, She's cookin' up a perfect meal, y'all. E. Bikkja come! Love maker laze, bunk with thine Norse, I'm gettin' tired after all that eatin', time to kick back and relax. The -itis is real, and the term "bikkja" can be confusing. Is it a dog or a vulgar term for a lady dog? Let's break it down: F. ? e. f.  G. g. By the way, "bikkja" means "animal" or "female dog" in Norse, or it can be a way more vulgar term. Just keepin' it real. Oh, and I'm using the term "Norse" 'cause my family's Dutch and we've got some Norwegian roots. It all fits together, right? With the goddess and almighty stuff?  So here's the deal: I asked my wife how to make rice, and she freaked out on me like I was some kind of idiot. I told her to chill and just give me the process, but instead we ended up arguing about who's responsible for making rice and all that jazz. I told her that I've made rice before without any issues, but she had to go and make a big deal out of it on the one day that I messed it up. So now I'm like, "Okay, fine, I'll just go ask the almighty rice god how to do it right." And that's how this whole sonnet thing came about. It's just a silly way to poke fun at our dumb arguments.  Anyway, thanks again for the help. Time to get back to work on this paper!
