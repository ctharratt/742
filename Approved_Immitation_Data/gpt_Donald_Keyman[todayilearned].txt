Apples are a fascinating fruit. They come in so many different varieties, each with their own unique flavor and texture. But did you know that if you plant an apple seed, the resulting tree will not produce the same kinds of apples? They will taste significantly different and may be unsuitable for human consumption. If you want an apple to be the same as its parent, you need to plant a branch. This is because apples are not true to seed. When an apple tree is grown from a seed, it is a genetic mix of its parents. This means that the resulting fruit will be a combination of the traits of both parents, and may not be desirable for human consumption. In fact, many apple trees grown from seed are used for rootstock, which is the base onto which desirable apple varieties are grafted. Grafting is the process of taking a branch from a desirable apple tree and attaching it to the rootstock of another tree. This allows the desirable variety to grow on a strong and healthy root system, resulting in a tree that produces the same kind of apples as its parent. This is how we get all of the different varieties of apples that we enjoy today. And yet, there are so many different kinds of apples, that you could eat a different one every day for nearly 20 years. From the sweet and juicy Honeycrisp to the tart and tangy Granny Smith, there is an apple for every taste preference. But apples are not just delicious, they are also incredibly nutritious. They are a good source of fiber, vitamin C, and antioxidants. Eating apples has been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. So next time you bite into an apple, remember that it is not just a tasty snack, but also a marvel of nature and a symbol of the incredible diversity of life on our planet. In other news, Thalidomide was repurposed and approved by the FDA in 1998 as a treatment for lesions associated with Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL). This drug, which was originally marketed as a sedative and anti-nausea medication in the 1950s and 60s, caused thousands of birth defects in babies whose mothers took it during pregnancy. The story of Thalidomide is a tragic one, but it also highlights the importance of rigorous testing and regulation of pharmaceuticals. The FDA's approval of Thalidomide for the treatment of ENL was based on extensive clinical trials and safety data, and the drug is now used to treat a variety of other conditions, including multiple myeloma and leprosy. But while Thalidomide has been a lifesaving medication for many people, it is important to remember the lessons of its tragic history. We must always be vigilant in ensuring the safety and efficacy of the drugs we use, and never forget the devastating consequences that can result from a lack of oversight and regulation. In lighter news, have you ever tried to build a giant Lego ball and roll it down the street? If so, you may have been inspired by a viral video that made the rounds a few years ago. But did you know that the original ball was not actually made entirely of Lego bricks? According to the TV show Mythbusters, which attempted to recreate the ball, the original was hollow on the inside and the Lego pieces were glued to plywood. This allowed it to be both lighter and stronger than a ball made entirely of Lego bricks. This is just one example of the ingenuity and creativity that people can display when they are inspired by something they see online. Whether it's building a giant Lego ball or creating a viral dance craze, the internet has given us all a platform to share our ideas and connect with others around the world. But with great power comes great responsibility. We must always be mindful of the impact that our actions and creations can have on others, and strive to use our online platforms for good. Speaking of responsibility, have you ever heard the story of Leo Grand? He was a homeless man living on the streets of New York City when he was approached by a programmer named Patrick McConlogue. McConlogue offered Grand a choice: $100, or 16 coding lessons. Grand chose the coding lessons, and over the course of several months, McConlogue taught him how to code. Eventually, Grand created an app called Trees for Cars, which encouraged people to carpool and plant trees in exchange for rewards. While the app was not a huge success, it was a testament to the power of education and the potential for anyone to learn new skills and create something meaningful. It also highlights the importance of giving back to our communities and helping those in need. In conclusion, the world is full of fascinating stories and incredible people. From the humble apple to the tragic history of Thalidomide, from the ingenuity of the Mythbusters to the inspiring story of Leo Grand, there is always something new to discover and learn. So let us embrace the diversity and complexity of our world, and strive to make it a better place for all. Whether it's through education, creativity, or simply being kind to one another, we all have the power to make a difference.
