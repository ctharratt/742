There is a serious problem in America with education, particularly in communities of color. It's important to address this issue without talking down to those affected. I apologize for my previous comment about "slacktivists." Holding a sign over a highway may seem like a small gesture, but it can still raise awareness and encourage people to register to vote. It's unfortunate that our subreddit has been derailed by these types of comments. We need to focus on the issues at hand and not get caught up in petty arguments. It's concerning to see that some people are blindly supporting Bernie Sanders without looking at the data. Yes, he may have won his home state, but he's behind in many other states. We can't ignore this fact just because we like him as a candidate. It's important to look at the bigger picture and consider all the information before making a decision. I've noticed that many people in the black community support Sanders, which makes me wonder if the media is lying to us about our race problem. We need to be careful not to fall for propaganda and misinformation. It's important to do our own research and make informed decisions. When it comes to healthcare, there's a lot of confusion and misinformation being spread. It's important to understand the differences between Medicaid, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). While Romney may have implemented a similar healthcare plan in Massachusetts, the ACA is not the same thing. Sanders has proposed a different healthcare plan altogether, which would eliminate the need for the ACA. I've noticed that some people are quick to dismiss the opinions of young people, but we need to remember that they are the future of our country. It's important to listen to their perspectives and take them seriously. We can't just write them off as ignorant or uninformed. I've also noticed that some people are quick to label others as trolls or accuse them of being dishonest. We need to be careful not to jump to conclusions and assume the worst about people. It's important to have civil discussions and try to understand each other's perspectives. When it comes to the presidential election, there are a lot of different opinions and beliefs. It's important to remember that we all have our own priorities and values. Some people may prioritize ending wars, while others may prioritize healthcare or education. We need to respect each other's opinions and not resort to name-calling or insults. I've noticed that some people are quick to label Trump as a white supremacist, but we need to be careful not to make baseless accusations. While he may have made some questionable comments in the past, we can't just assume that he's a racist. We need to look at his policies and actions and make informed decisions. Similarly, we can't just assume that all Republicans are bad or that all Democrats are good. We need to look at each candidate individually and consider their track record and policies. It's important to be open-minded and not just blindly follow a party line. I've noticed that some people are quick to dismiss the opinions of Christians or accuse them of being hypocrites. We need to remember that everyone has their own beliefs and values, and it's important to respect them. We can't just assume that someone is a bad person because they have different beliefs than us. Overall, we need to have civil discussions and try to understand each other's perspectives. We can't just resort to name-calling or insults. We need to be open-minded and willing to consider different viewpoints. Only then can we make informed decisions and work towards a better future for all Americans.
