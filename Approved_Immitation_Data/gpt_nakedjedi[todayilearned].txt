Cheaper than flying. That's what I always say. Why waste all that power and money on a plane ticket when you can just drive or take a train? Plus, you're not violating any laws of thermodynamics by doing so. All the energy is being stored in the concrete, man. And if that motor really ran for 2 trillion years, there would be more energy stored in that concrete than in the entire universe. I know what I'm talking about, too. I just finished the first half of intro to physics for non-science majors at college. My mom also says I'm smart, so there's that. But let's talk about something else. Like how you're not really rich if you make $100k a year. I mean, if you're a family of four, you're going to struggle to pay the mortgage, own two cars, and save for retirement and college. That's just the American dream, right? Hopefully the next president brings it back. I mean, Obama gave the Queen an iPod with his favorite songs on it. Sometimes I don't understand the bamster. And don't even get me started on the metric system. There are two types of countries in the world: those that use the metric system and those that put a man on the moon. 'Merica! Yes, it's a good thing. And speaking of America, did you know that the American middle class is losing ground? That's what the title of the original article from PEW says, anyway. We need to do something about that. Oh, and have you ever needed a specialty wrench to change a tub drain or kitchen sink strainer? I mean, I just heard about this today, but it seems like something that would come in handy once in a while. They should add those to the tool kit. And speaking of tools, have you ever tried to X-ray a picture to see someone's nipples? I mean, I haven't, but I'm sure there are some internet creeps out there who know how to do it. Not that I'm condoning that kind of behavior, of course. But let's talk about something more serious. Would you let a rehabilitated pedophile live next to your house with your kids? I mean, that's the problem, right? You can't be sure. And what about investing? Would you have invested in something if you knew it was going to fail? I mean, that's just common sense. And have you seen /u/lojink's gonewild posts? They're amazing. I mean, I just spent an hour looking at all of them. She's hot. Here's the link for those who haven't seen it. And did you know that African males think 7 inches is small? I mean, I don't know if that's true or not, but it's something to think about. And speaking of things to think about, did you know that the National Institute of Health's Center for Alternative and Complimentary Medicine spent $387,000 to study the effects of Swedish massages on rabbits? I mean, we have that too! Here's a pic. And let's not forget about fighter pilots. They're first, last, always. And if I ever hear of any of them shooting at someone in a parachute, I'll shoot them myself. I mean, I guess the Japanese never got the memo. But let's get back to the important stuff. Thank you for giving me a new name for my ass. Krakatoa! And it's only 11:55 AM on Saturday, but I predict this post will be on the front page of Reddit by late this afternoon. I mean, it's got cats and dogs as the subject matter. That's a slam dunk on Reddit. If the saying was "it's raining cats and dogs and big tits," I'd be on the front page right now. And speaking of sayings, did you know that "break a leg" comes from the theater? It's a way of wishing someone good luck without actually saying it. I mean, I know there are other explanations of the etymology of this phrase, but this is the most common. I think saying it's false is a little extreme. And speaking of extreme, let's talk about climate change. I mean, satellite temperatures have shown no heating in the last 17 years. To explain that, people have to cite temperature rises in the deep ocean and claim the heat is all there. Fine. Claim that. But don't tell me climate change is "settled science." If it was settled science, you wouldn't have to go looking for reasons to explain why the satellite data did not show warming and hasn't for 17 years. The left often claims global warming is settled science and shouts down anyone who points out inconsistencies and flaws in the theory. They call them anti-intellectuals like you just did. There is no such thing as settled science. You don't make trillion dollar policy decisions on science that isn't settled and can't even predict 5 years into the future. And don't even get me started on the 97% of all scientists supporting global warming. That's a complete sham. Here's an article from Forbes magazine. But let's end on a positive note. Cheers! Yes, I'm afraid of ignorant people who can vote. I mean, I don't care if you don't agree with me as long as your vote is informed. Sometimes I can't help myself. The scary thing is all these kids on Reddit get to vote. Hopefully they're in NY or CA where it doesn't matter. And speaking of NY and CA, I would have said those states are filled with these kinds of people, but I guess we each now know where the other lives!
