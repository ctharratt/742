The Button: A Social Experiment in Human Behavior The Button. It's a simple concept, really. A timer counts down from 60 seconds, and when it reaches zero, a button appears. You can press the button, but only once. And once you do, your flair changes color based on the time you pressed it. Orange for 60-51 seconds, yellow for 50-41 seconds, and so on. But there's a catch. The community has decided that anyone who presses the button at 60 seconds is a "filthy presser" and anyone who presses it at 0 seconds is the "Pressiah." And so, a social experiment was born. At first, it was just a silly game. People pressed the button and shared their flair color on social media. But then, something strange happened. People started to care. They formed alliances, created subreddits, and even wrote code to track the button's countdown. And then, the trolls arrived. The trolls were the people who tried to trick others into pressing the button at the wrong time. They created fake confirmation screens, spread rumors about secret rewards, and even pretended to be the "Pressiah" themselves. And it worked. People fell for their tricks, and they felt stupid and annoyed. But why did they do it? What is it about this social experiment that makes so many people act like dicks? Psychologists will probably write papers on this phenomenon once it's all over. But for now, we can only speculate. Perhaps it's the anonymity of the internet that allows people to act out their worst impulses. Or maybe it's the thrill of being part of something bigger than themselves. Whatever the reason, it's both sad and embarrassing for Reddit, in my humble opinion. But amidst all the chaos and trolling, there are still those who play the game with honor. They wait patiently for the time they want, and they press the button without trying to trick others. They form alliances not to deceive, but to help each other achieve their goals. And they understand that the true reward is not the flair color, but the experience of being part of something unique and unpredictable. As for me, I'm somewhere in between. I've pressed the button a few times, but I've also fallen for some of the trolls' tricks. I've formed alliances, but I've also seen them crumble under the weight of suspicion and paranoia. And I've come to realize that the button is not just a game, but a mirror of human behavior. We all want to be part of something bigger than ourselves. We all want to feel like we belong. And we all want to be rewarded for our efforts. But sometimes, in our quest for recognition and validation, we forget about the people around us. We forget that they are not just obstacles to overcome, but fellow human beings with their own hopes and fears. The button is a reminder of this. It's a reminder that we are all in this together, whether we like it or not. And that our actions, no matter how small, can have a ripple effect on the people around us. So let's play the game with honor. Let's form alliances based on trust and respect. And let's remember that the true reward is not the flair color, but the experience of being part of something unique and unpredictable. In conclusion, the button is more than just a game. It's a social experiment in human behavior. It's a mirror of our desires, our fears, and our flaws. And it's up to us to decide how we want to play it. Will we be trolls, deceiving and manipulating others for our own gain? Or will we be honorable players, working together to achieve our goals and enjoying the ride? The choice is ours.
