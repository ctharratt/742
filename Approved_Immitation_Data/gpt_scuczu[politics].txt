Well, well, well, here we are again, folks. Another election season, another round of political mudslinging, and another opportunity for us to choose between the lesser of two negatives. Ain't democracy grand? But seriously, can we talk about the state of our country for a minute? I mean, I graduated from college over a decade ago with a degree in Computer Graphic Technology, and since then, my pay has only gone down while my workload has gone up. And I know I'm not alone in this. It seems like every day there's another story about how the middle class is shrinking, how people are struggling to make ends meet, and how the American Dream is slipping further and further out of reach. And yet, what do our politicians do? They bicker and argue and point fingers, all while lining their own pockets and catering to the interests of their wealthy donors. It's enough to make you want to throw up your hands and give up on the whole system. But we can't do that, can we? Because as flawed as our democracy may be, it's still the best system we've got. And that means we have to keep fighting, keep pushing for change, and keep holding our elected officials accountable. So, how do we do that? Well, for starters, we need to start paying attention to the issues that matter. And I don't mean the sensationalized, soundbite-friendly issues that the media loves to focus on. I mean the real, substantive issues that affect our daily lives. Like, for example, the minimum wage. I don't know about you, but I've been working for minimum wage for the past four years, and let me tell you, it's not enough to live on. And yet, there are people out there who argue that raising the minimum wage would hurt small businesses and kill jobs. But the truth is, a living wage is not only good for workers, it's good for the economy as a whole. When people have more money to spend, they spend it, which creates more demand for goods and services, which in turn creates more jobs. It's not rocket science, folks. And speaking of jobs, let's talk about healthcare. I don't know about you, but I'd rather pay a little more in taxes and make sure that everyone has access to healthcare than pay exorbitant premiums just so my family can be covered. And yet, there are people out there who argue that universal healthcare is socialism and that it would destroy our economy. But the truth is, every other modern country in the world has some form of universal healthcare, and they're doing just fine. In fact, many of them have better health outcomes and lower costs than we do. So why can't we learn from their example and do what's best for our citizens? And while we're at it, let's talk about the environment. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure that climate change is real, and that we need to do something about it before it's too late. And yet, there are people out there who argue that climate change is a hoax and that we shouldn't do anything that might hurt the profits of the fossil fuel industry. But the truth is, we can't keep burning fossil fuels forever. They're a finite resource, and they're causing irreparable harm to our planet. We need to invest in renewable energy, we need to reduce our carbon emissions, and we need to do it now. And finally, let's talk about the political system itself. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure that our democracy is broken. We've got a system where money talks louder than votes, where politicians are more interested in getting re-elected than in doing what's best for their constituents, and where gerrymandering and voter suppression are rampant. And yet, there are people out there who argue that everything is just fine, that we don't need to change anything, and that anyone who suggests otherwise is a radical. But the truth is, we need to reform our political system if we want to have any hope of fixing the other problems I've mentioned. We need to get money out of politics, we need to make it easier for people to vote, and we need to hold our elected officials accountable when they fail to do their jobs. So, there you have it, folks. My take on the state of our country and what we need to do to fix it. I know it's not a comprehensive list, and I know there are people out there who will disagree with me on some or all of these points. But that's the beauty of democracy, isn't it? We can have different opinions and still work together to find solutions that benefit everyone. And that's what we need to do now more than ever. We need to come together as a country, put aside our differences, and work towards a brighter future for ourselves and for future generations. Because if we don't, who will?
