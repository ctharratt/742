The field of computer science (CS) has been rapidly evolving over the past few decades, with new technologies and advancements being made every day. However, there are still some fundamental differences between health-related research and research in CS, and one of the most significant factors driving these differences is the open-access requirement on publications stemming from research funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US. Since 2008, the NIH has required that all publications resulting from research they fund be made freely available to the public. This has led to a culture of open access in the health-related research community, where researchers are encouraged to share their findings and collaborate with others in the field. However, other US government agencies, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), have no such requirement. This is set to change in January 2016, when an NSF open-access requirement will go into effect for publications stemming from research funded in 2016 or later. While this may not have an immediate effect, it is likely that we will see more universal open access for CS papers in the future, similar to what we have come to expect in health-related fields. As a CS professor, I often tell my students that a CS degree with a business minor is an excellent combination, but very few of them actually pursue this option. When it comes to preparing for a CS degree, I believe that learning math is the most important factor. Programming skills are certainly useful, but they are not the most critical aspect of a CS education. If you have not done any programming before, I would encourage you to give it a try and see if you enjoy it. If you do, then great – go build something, whether it's a website, a robot, or something else entirely. However, if you find that programming is not for you, then there are plenty of other college plans to consider. It's also important to note that the theory of computation has been developed to a greater depth than most CS master's students today would care to learn. While the first programmable, automatic digital computer was likely Konrad Zuse's Z3, which was finished in 1941, the theory of computation had already been developed to a significant extent by 1940. This means that theory had a significant head start on hardware, and it continues to be a critical aspect of CS research and education today. When it comes to pursuing a master's degree in CS, it's important to understand that it is not a mini-Ph.D. program. While there are certainly some similarities between the two, they are fundamentally different programs with different goals and requirements. Additionally, master's programs can vary greatly from one institution to another, so it's important to do your research and find a program that aligns with your interests and goals. In terms of funding for master's programs, it's important to understand that different institutions have different policies. While some programs may offer full funding to all accepted students, others may only offer funding to a select few. Additionally, the type of funding available may vary – some programs may offer teaching assistantships, while others may offer research assistantships. It's important to research the specific program you are interested in and understand what funding options are available. When it comes to applying to CS master's programs, it's important to understand that the evaluation process can vary greatly from one institution to another. While funding is certainly a consideration, the primary concern is typically whether the applicant is qualified for the program. For non-US applicants, this can be challenging, as their applications may come from systems that are unfamiliar to US institutions. It's important to reach out to the program and ask what kind of information is needed to ensure that they understand your qualifications and experience. Finally, it's important to note that this subreddit is not the appropriate place for certain types of questions. While we are happy to help with many CS-related topics, questions about specific computer issues are better suited for other subreddits, such as /r/computers. In conclusion, the field of computer science is constantly evolving, and there are many factors that drive the differences between health-related research and research in CS. However, by understanding the importance of open access, the role of theory in CS education and research, and the differences between master's and Ph.D. programs, you can better prepare yourself for a successful career in this exciting and rapidly growing field.
