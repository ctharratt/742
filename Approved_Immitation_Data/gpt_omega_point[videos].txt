ITT: People making false assumptions. It's amazing how quick people are to jump to conclusions without knowing the full story. Take for example the in-house editor at Shots of Awe. Some people assumed that he was copying my style, but the truth is that he started doing the same style as mine ever since I made a video for them. I made two videos in total, and they couldn't afford to outsource their post-production as Shots of Awe is a very small part of Discovery Digital Networks. Speaking of contracts, I'm currently working on two. One is a documentary and the other is just some corporate stuff. After doing a few videos for my own channel, I started applying for contract work through Craigslist. After a couple of years of doing that, big contracts started to come in. This one was from Discovery Digital Networks: a one-minute video I put together about Psychedelics: An Illegal Experience. I made this after my second mushroom trip, and it was my first motion graphics project ever, using Adobe After Effects. I watched a bunch of tutorials online just to be able to make this video. Three years later and I'm a self-taught professional motion graphics and visual effects artist. Can we say... the mushroom experience changed my life? Not exactly what you asked for, but let's talk about psychedelics for a moment. According to experts, for example scientists at MAPS, most LSD that you find these days are not pure. Same with MDMA. This is terrible. If they were legal, we could have had access to the pure substance. Also, for over 40 years, scientific research had been banned on them. As a result of this and constant propaganda, most people have a negative view about psychedelics. So many of us can't even share our life-changing experiences with our loved ones, like our parents. We can't talk about it openly with most people. Should it be schedule 1? Should it be illegal at all? No. Should we educate people about what psychedelics are without pumping fear and lies into people? Yes. This way we will have access to legal psychedelics that are pure and best quality, and we will have an educated population that would use the drugs responsibly. Now, some people might argue that LSD can ruin lives. But let's be real here, gambling, alcohol, video games, extreme sports, etc. all can ruin lives. All are legal, and should be legal. Harvard prof Richard Alpert describing his first psychedelic experience said, "Both books are terrifying." I was born and raised in Iran, and we were forced to read the Quran. I've read it fully once, and selections of it countless times. Islam, like most other religions, is about adhering to the Golden Rule and being self-disciplined and not being an asshole. You might want to actually read the Quran. Moving on to a different topic, have you ever heard of bruxism? It's when you grind your teeth at night. I too lit up with 'wtf' when I first heard my own teeth grinding sound. I've been using nightguards for three years now. But in between there have been weeks that I went without one. The video I posted was captured during one of those periods. I had no idea how it sounded until my girlfriend recorded this video. That red flair though. 298 more points and you will prove Reddit wrong: "Level 7 | 500+ | We are pretty sure no one will make it this far. If you do, you'll get a month of Reddit Gold on us, pink flair, and more stuff if we can think of it." Let's talk about Iran for a moment. He is not referring to Khomeini by "ruthless dictator of their choosing", he is referring to the Shah, and this is a fact. For those who want to know more about this, start at 27:13, watch for a few minutes. One thing I want to point out though is that it's easy to blame outside sources for the seriously fucked up situations in a country, but the truth is, it all comes down to the people of the country that determine the conditions. I think it's only when you have an uninformed population, manipulation becomes possible. I was born in Iran and lived there for 19 years, and the main reason I left the country wasn't the government, but the culture and people. Let's switch gears and talk about YouTube. Did you know that you can create multiple channels under the same email address? This was true when I first started my channel three years ago. Not sure if it's still a requirement. But if it is, there is a work-around. For example, my main channel is Omega Point. I can easily create many secondary accounts within Omega Point - same email address, just a different channel. And all the new channels will have monetizing option, without me setting things up from scratch. What surprises me the most is that these idiots don't even know how to download YouTube videos and reupload them without losing quality. Speaking of monetizing, did you know that per ad viewed, the channel owner gets revenue? However, as a channel owner, I'm not even slightly mad that people use adblocker. B... but you are ruining OP's business of reuploading already existing videos on YouTube and monetizing them with ads to make money. Agreed. Let's end on a positive note. Jason Silva on his first video for the Shots of Awe channel talks about a similar thing: "I'm planning to make more videos like that with much higher quality in production. So stay tuned!" I'm trying to help. I hope someday having cannabis or mushrooms or LSD isn't considered a crime anymore. The War on Drugs is just stupid and is a clear sign that we are living in an oppressed society.
