Hey there. I wanted to chime in on the topic of holsters and accessories for our beloved Glocks. As a Glock enthusiast, I know firsthand the importance of finding the right holster and accessories to enhance the functionality and performance of our firearms. First and foremost, let's talk about holsters. I personally prefer appendix carry and have found the Raven VG2 to be an excellent choice for this style of carry. The VG2 offers excellent retention and comfort, and the trigger is always covered until it is needed, making it a safe choice for everyday carry. If you're looking for a minimalist holster for your Glock 42 or 43, the Q-Series Stealth is a great option. It's lightweight, easy to conceal, and offers good retention. When it comes to accessories, there are a few that I believe every Glock owner should consider. One of these is a weapon light. A weapon light can be a game-changer in low-light situations, allowing you to identify your target and make more accurate shots. The Streamlight TLR-1HL is a great choice for those who want a bright, reliable light that won't break the bank. Another accessory to consider is night sights. While they may not be necessary for everyone, I find that they can be a valuable addition to any Glock, especially if you plan on using it for home defense or in low-light situations. Trijicon HD XR sights are my personal favorite, offering excellent visibility in all lighting conditions. If you're looking to customize your Glock, there are a few options to consider as well. One of these is cerakoting. Cerakote is a durable, ceramic-based coating that can be applied to your Glock to give it a unique look and protect it from wear and tear. There are a variety of colors and patterns to choose from, so you can truly make your Glock your own. Another option for customization is color filling. This involves filling in the engraved lettering on your Glock with a contrasting color, making it stand out and giving it a more unique look. It's a relatively inexpensive way to personalize your Glock and make it truly yours. Overall, there are a lot of options when it comes to holsters and accessories for your Glock. It's important to find what works best for you and your needs, whether that's a specific holster or a particular accessory. With the right gear, you can make your Glock even better and more effective for whatever purpose you have in mind.
