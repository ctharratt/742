Possibly? Really only looking for camera stuff and maybe a 1tb hdd at this point, but what do you have? I've been on the hunt for some good deals lately, trying to upgrade my setup without breaking the bank. I've been scouring forums and websites, looking for the best prices on the things I need. It's been a bit of a challenge, but I'm determined to find what I'm looking for. Looking for 290 shipped, which is a fair deal compared with what's out there in my opinion. I've been doing my research and I think I've found a good deal on a camera that I've had my eye on. It's a bit more than I was hoping to spend, but I think it's worth it for the quality. Plus, the seller is offering free shipping, which is always a plus. Thanks for the response! That definitely was a pretty good deal, but I'm looking to get some sort of bundle if I can. I'm trying to save as much money as possible, so if I can get a few things together for a discounted price, that would be ideal. Did you just not like the apple one? I'm interested in leather in general but I think if I'm gonna spend real money on a leather case it's gotta be on the saddle one, it looks so cool. I've been thinking about getting a leather case for my phone, but I'm not sure if it's worth the investment. I've heard good things about the saddle one, though, so maybe I'll consider it. I actually just got one off of Amazon already! Thanks for the offer though :) Definitely interested in the speck and apple leather, what colors are they? Do you know which specific Spigen ones you have? I've been looking for some good phone cases, and I think I've found a few that I like. I'm not too picky about the colors, as long as they're not too flashy or obnoxious. Cool, how much are you looking for it and a controller? 2 controllers if you have a 2nd one. I've been wanting to get a new gaming console for a while now, and I think I've found a good deal on a used one. I'm hoping to get a good price on it, and maybe even a couple of controllers if possible. I have a Galaxy S4 with accessories if you're interested. Previous version, I bought it roughly a year ago. I'm trying to sell my old phone to make some extra cash. It's not the newest model, but it's still in good condition and comes with some accessories. Didn't really realize they were that low 0.0 I guess I'm just better off returning them or something. I recently bought some headphones that I thought were a good deal, but it turns out they're not worth as much as I thought. I'm debating whether to return them or try to sell them for a lower price. Would you be willing to trade a G4 with extra cases and batteries for the iPhone? I've been thinking about switching to a different phone, and I think the G4 might be a good option. I'm willing to trade my iPhone for it, as long as it comes with some extra accessories. Cool, can we do it in 2 separate transactions because I don't have any integrated graphics? Like I "buy" your GPU, receive it then "sell" mine to you? I'd just rather not be unable to use my computer for however long the shipping process takes. I'm trying to upgrade my computer, but I don't want to be without it for too long. I'm hoping to work out a deal with someone where we can do the transaction in two parts, so I don't have to be without my computer for too long. The ones without the controls on them. Got a transparent pair through massdrop for $13. They come with a nice little case, plenty of different tips, and are super low profile, so much so that I can lay in bed with my head on its side and not have them hurt my ears. I've been looking for some good earbuds, and I think I've found a good deal on a pair that I like. They're low profile and come with a nice case, which is always a plus. I have a Sapphire Tri-X OC 290 that I'd be looking to sell or trade for a lower level GPU+cash. Do you have an old one that you're upgrading from? I'm trying to upgrade my graphics card, and I think I've found a good deal on a used one. I'm hoping to trade my old one in for a lower level GPU and some cash. Check those out, I have pairs by them and they rock. I've been looking for some good headphones, and I think I've found a brand that I like. I've heard good things about them, so I'm hoping to try them out soon. Is there any way you'd be willing to trade your G4 for a VZW one with accessories? I'm looking to switch from VZW to T mobile. I'm trying to switch carriers, and I think I've found a good deal on a phone that I like. I'm hoping to trade my old phone in for it, as long as it comes with some accessories. Ooooh boy, I'm in IL and have a GS4 in good shape with extras that I'm trying to get rid of, please PM me before you buy something. Will edit this with link to full info from my other post here. I'm trying to sell my old phone, and I think I've found a buyer. I'm hoping to make the sale soon, so I can get some extra cash. Yeah, if you're not comfortable with it that's fine, that's definitely the lowest I can go on the price. It's always a bit of a negotiation when it comes to buying and selling things. I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I also want to be fair to the seller. Not sure how to accurately convey the size of the band, other than to say I'm 5'8 140 and it fits me with a bunch of room to spare. I'm trying to sell a watch band, and I'm not sure how to describe the size. I'm hoping to find a buyer who can appreciate it for what it is. 155 for just the phone. I'm trying to sell my old phone, and I think I've found a buyer. I'm hoping to make the sale soon, so I can get some extra cash. I'd suggest not getting the 360 if you're set on a wear device though, you really feel the slow processor nowadays. If you're set on the round screen, try and find a deal on a an urbane, otherwise I'd suggest an LG G watch. I've been thinking about getting a smartwatch, and I think I've found a few that I like. I'm not sure which one to get, though, so I'm doing some research to find the best one for me. The gear fit is nice because it works perfectly as a watch and media controller, which are generally the two main functions that at least I use it for. I really enjoyed using it. I've been using a fitness tracker for a while now, and I think I've found one that I like. It's nice because it can also be used as a watch and media controller, which is always a plus. You won't even need to take it to Verizon if you don't want to, all it needs is a valid SIM card. The phone will work right away. I'm trying to sell my old phone, and I'm hoping to make the sale soon. It's a good phone, and I think the buyer will be happy with it. Nah sorry, I feel like I could definitely get more on swappa right now, I'm just trying to use /hardwareswap to get this done quicker with less hassle. I'm trying to sell something, but I'm not willing to go too low on the price. I think I can get a better deal on another website, but I'm hoping to make the sale quickly and easily. Sorry!

Great price on the 2tb in case anyone was wondering, somebody jump on this. I've been looking for a good deal on a hard drive, and I think I've found one. It's a good price, and I'm hoping someone will take advantage of it. I'll take this if he doesn't. I've been looking for something to buy, and I think I found a good deal on a product. I'm hoping to make the purchase soon, before someone else takes it. Why are you getting rid of it? I'm trying to buy something, and I'm curious why the seller is getting rid of it. I want to make sure it's in good condition and worth the price. It really depends on the model. The can range pretty significantly in ram amounts and screen/battery quality, and price comes with that. I'm trying to buy a new computer, and I'm not sure which one to get. I'm doing some research to find the best one for me, and I'm learning that the price can vary quite a bit depending on the model. If you didn't sell to him I'm interested. I
