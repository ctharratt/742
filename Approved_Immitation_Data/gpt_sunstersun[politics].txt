Okay, so let's talk politics. I mean, have you seen the latest debate? Rubio was actually pretty impressive with his response, but let's be real, the wall is just a fictional concept. I mean, come on, bring back the pissing contest! Oh wait, there's more than three people in this debate? Rubio walked right into that one. He was literally stumped. And then there's Trump, always making me laugh. "Thank you, this guy endorsed me. Loser?" I mean, seriously? You're calling a guy who has a net worth of 4 billion and is about to win the Republican nomination after having no political experience at all a LOSER?  But let's talk about immigration, because that's a VERY VERY controversial topic. And don't even get me started on the Jewish part, because that's most irrelevant when it comes to baby boomers. I mean, they were around for when socialism/communism/cold war dominated politics. They won't vote for a socialist. And this is before the Republicans even start attacking him.  And what about the middle class? Has Hillary said anything about them? And don't even get me started on die hard communists applauding Bernie's positions. It's just retarded. But let's be real, he's gonna beat Rubio in Florida and he's tied with Cruz in Texas. What chance does anyone else have? LMAO.  But hold up, let's not get ahead of ourselves. No, he won't win the primary. He'll lose or not win anything at all. You can't change things from the losing side in politics. And let's not forget, I'm Canadian, so I have no idea how the tax system works in the US. I mean, most people pay taxes, just specifically federal income tax. Some people don't pay. But people can change their opinions, you know? Sanders will never have it in the bag. The donations will come in MOST when it's a close race and they think their donations matter. Not when they don't matter. Because people think he's got a great shot at winning, which he does. But will people still donate in droves after SC and ST?  And let's not forget, history shows that donations in small amounts dry up when a candidate starts losing. Well, I applaud you for that, but history isn't on your side. And let's not forget, Sanders' donation base is anything but reliable. It's mostly small donations from a larger population of people. If momentum swings and Sanders loses big time in SC and ST like he's supposed to, do you really think young adults are gonna keep contributing? They won't openly toss an election. No way. You're fucking crazy if you think that.  But let's talk about the rules. It doesn't mean shit to me. It's a good thing your opinion is irrelevant and the law says they are breaking the rules. And let's not forget, in the name of manifest destiny, the US slaughtered the native people of North America. Seriously? You're comparing something that happened hundreds of years ago?  And let's talk about Trump's small loan. He thinks a million dollars is a small loan. It is a small loan. You might not think it is, but it's a small loan on any business scale. And let's not forget, the more candidates there are, the better for Trump. He has his loyal group of voters, while the other candidates split votes. He isn't clueless at all. He's selling books and fucking over Cruz. Welcome Republican nomination, Donald Trump.  But let's talk about the Senate. They can do whatever they want. They'll get voted out of the Senate, but they can do it. They're probably waiting to see if Rubio has any chance, to be honest. If Rubio beats Trump, they definitely won't meet with Obama. And let's not forget, I will vote for Republicans in the midterm election. That's what version 3.0 was, right? I would expect a liberal Senate to do their job even if I don't like the outcome. You could expect it all you want, but roles reversed, the same thing would be happening. You really think a Democratic Senate would allow a Republican president to appoint Scalia 2.0?  And let's not forget, it's not intellectuals, it's the poor people of the Democratic party who want free stuff. Conservatives also think Sanders is a socialist. Who do you think they will hate more? And let's not forget, the number of amendments and bills means nothing. Also, before Hillary was running for POTUS, she had a very high approval rating and lots of Republicans like John McCain came out with their respect. But no Republican will ever work with a socialist.  And let's talk about Trump's suits. I'm pretty sure they're not made in China. And let's not forget, Bernie does have a history of working well with Republicans. Yeah, I'm gonna have to call BS on that one. Do you have any examples of Bernie working well with Republicans on a relatively large scale matter? Except Hillary has done much more to help the Democratic party get elected with her funding for the reelection season. Also, as much as the Republicans hate Hillary, they will go fucking insane with a socialist.  But let's talk about Hitler. Yeah, he was a great politician. No denying that. He's one of the greatest public speakers in all of history. But let's not forget, don't drop out Kasich. You can keep going! Don't give up until after 2 weeks after ST, please. And let's not forget, if Trump wins, his political campaign will be the most unique and studied thing in political history. He's a master at manipulating the media.  But let's talk about deporting people. Is it inhumane to deport people who have no legal right to be living in the states? Damn, guess those Latinos will just have to immigrate to the states the legal way. And let's not forget, young people are just doing what they usually do. And yes, China is not a perfect model, but who is? The point is that they provide care for a much larger population. I'm not talking about their model, I'm talking about their man power. The most expensive thing in production is man hours. In China, man hour wages can't compare at all to the US. So if we are gonna model our health care after someone, China's system is unrealistic.  And let's talk about Bernie's appeal. An old Jewish white guy really doesn't appeal. Even if he was part of the civil rights movement. And let's not forget, doctors don't become cheaper in bulk. Infrastructure doesn't become cheaper in bulk. The more advanced the medical field becomes, the more expensive it is. New tech/new research is expensive. I live in Canada, and there's the problem of paying for medicare. Only cheap mass produceable things become cheaper with more purchasing. BTW, China which has 4 times our population provides health care to their people. Yeah, the USA might have a problem with health care, but China isn't the best example.  And let's talk about the primaries. She won more delegates. Or here's a crazy idea, black people just like Clinton better? That's 3 states out of 7 going for Sanders. He's already lost Iowa, Nevada, and SC (big margin). At some point, staying close/tied isn't enough.  So there you have it, folks. My ramblings on politics. It's a crazy world out there, but we'll get through it.
