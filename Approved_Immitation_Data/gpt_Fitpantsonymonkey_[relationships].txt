It's a sad reality that many relationships end due to broken promises and unfulfilled expectations. In the case of OP, her husband promised to move back to their home country, but instead lured her into the USA under false pretenses. It's understandable that OP never wanted to move to the USA and even considered separating over it. The only reason she and her son are in the USA is because of her husband's promise, which he failed to keep. For some people, the USA might be the promised land, but for others, it's not. It's important to understand that everyone has different preferences and priorities when it comes to where they want to live and raise their family. It's not fair for one partner to make unilateral decisions that affect the entire family without consulting the other. It's also important to note that the husband is not losing his child for the rest of his life. He has the option to keep his promise and move to Europe as well. It's a matter of priorities and what's best for the family as a whole. A father who is a lying and cheating sack and is never around is not a good role model for his child. Having a family is more than just providing financial support. It's about being present and involved in their lives. Money can't buy happiness, and if someone is unhappy in a given country, money won't change that. It's not just about the income level or opportunities available. It's about the culture, values, and way of life. As someone from Germany, I turned down a job offer for the USA because I don't like the culture and wouldn't want my kids growing up there. It's not that there aren't opportunities in Eastern Europe either. Education is good, and with dual citizenship, you can always move back. It's much more important for a child to grow up with family than having a second or third car. American parents work much more than any other parents, and thus spend less time with their child. This can have a negative impact on the child's development and well-being. It's important to find a balance between work and family life. In Eastern Europe, the average income may not be as high as in the USA, but it's still considered middle class compared to most of the world. Countries like Slovenia, Estonia, Czech, and Croatia have an average income of $29,087, which is hardly poor. When it comes to sexual health, there's a lot of fear-mongering and misinformation out there. It's important to understand the risks and take appropriate precautions, but it's also important not to let fear control your life. Using condoms or dental dams may not be fun, but they can offer protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It's important to find a method that works for you and your partner and to be honest about your sexual history and any potential risks. Vaccination is also an important tool in preventing STIs. The HPV vaccine, for example, can protect against several strains of the virus that can cause cancer and genital warts. While no vaccine is 100% effective, the HPV vaccine has been shown to be highly effective in preventing infection. It's important to talk to your healthcare provider about which vaccines are recommended for you and your partner. It's also important to remember that not all STIs are preventable or curable. Herpes, for example, is a common STI that can be transmitted even when there are no visible symptoms. It's important to have open and honest communication with your partner about your sexual health and to get tested regularly. In conclusion, relationships require trust, communication, and compromise. It's important to be honest about your expectations and priorities and to work together to find a solution that works for everyone. Moving to a new country is a big decision that affects the entire family, and it's important to consider all factors before making a decision. When it comes to sexual health, it's important to understand the risks and take appropriate precautions, but it's also important not to let fear control your life. Vaccination and regular testing can help prevent and detect STIs, but open and honest communication with your partner is key.
