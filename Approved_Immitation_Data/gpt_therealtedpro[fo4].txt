So, have you guys heard about the new DLC for Fallout 4? Far Harbor is the latest addition to the game and it promises to be a thrilling adventure. I'm particularly excited about the possibility of underwater sections in the game. I mean, how cool would that be? I've already stocked up on 20k of steel and wood just in case. But that's not the only thing that's got me excited. Remember when Kellogg spoke through Nick after the memory den? I was hoping that would happen more often. In fact, I think it would be awesome if Kellogg came back through Nick and tried to kill you in a future DLC. You could either kill Nick or somehow remove the chip. It would add a whole new level of excitement to the game. And speaking of exciting additions, have you guys figured out how to mod the blaster to use Fusion cells? I've been trying to figure it out forever. I really hope the developers plan on doing something with it because it would be a shame to just leave it as is. Now, let's talk about the crash site. Head southeast of Oberland Station and you'll see the trees on fire. There's also a cave nearby that's definitely worth exploring. Just follow the greenish blood-trail from the crash and you'll find it. And wouldn't it be awesome if you could zone out of the cave to a courser, with three or four synths relayed behind him? They could ask you to hand over the blaster and if you refuse, they knock you unconscious. When you wake up, the ship is gone and a new dialogue option opens up randomly with certain NPCs where you could ask them about it and they look at you like you're crazy. When you eventually make it to the Institute, you find the blaster and other weapons derived from it. It's possible that they're already using tech from the aliens, just look at how they transport back and forth. I agree with the idea that the BoS would be interested in the alien tech. They're always hungry for new technology and it would make sense for them to want to get their hands on it. I also enjoy anything to do with UFOs and I'm hoping they expand on this in future DLC. It would be nice to battle against them or work with them in some way, depending on whether you killed or didn't kill the alien. I just really hope they don't leave it at what it is now because it would be a big missed opportunity. Now, let's talk about the Cambridge Police Station. Have you guys seen the explosion that triggers when you reach the crash site? It's pretty awesome. It triggers no matter where you are, but when you reach the crash, it's the same path always. I reloaded a few times to get the best shot. The first few were right outside the front door and I couldn't get a good shot, so I hit the roof and took some Jet to slow it down a bit. It's definitely worth checking out. And have you guys found the component on Myrna? In my game, she didn't have it on her. But there is a ghoul doctor named Daisy whose house is sitting above the little pond that's highly radioactive. I came upon it right around that general area. I can't remember exactly where, but it's along the west side of the map, west of Arcjet. I also came across three ghoul settlers and a preacher burying a fellow settler named Blake. I couldn't interact beyond the basic "hey" and "yeah." I stood back and let the preacher say his thing and the settlers say something, and that was it. I enjoy finding things like this in the game. It adds a whole new level of depth to the world. But let's get back to Far Harbor. I'm really hoping that the developers have included some underwater sections in the game. It would be so cool to explore the depths of the ocean and see what kind of creatures are lurking down there. And with 20k of steel and wood, I'm ready for anything. Overall, I'm really excited about the new DLC and all the possibilities it brings. From underwater sections to battling against UFOs, there's so much to look forward to. I just hope the developers don't leave any stone unturned and make the most of this opportunity.
