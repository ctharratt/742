Yo, what's up fellow gamers? I gotta say, I'm not really one for achievements. I mean, why waste my time repeating the same thing over and over again just so I can brag to my friends about how much time I wasted on a game? Nah, I'd rather just enjoy the natural moment and soak it all in. But I gotta admit, sometimes I do get a little competitive and compare my playtime to others. Maybe I put in a little too much time, but hey, it's all in good fun. Speaking of good games, did you guys hear about Halo 5 getting a 9? A 9! Even Angry Joe, the biggest Halo fan out there, was like "WTF?" I mean, don't get me wrong, I love me some Halo, but a 9 seems a little high. And don't even get me started on people who post low scores for good games based on one or two cons. Like, come on, give credit where credit is due. But enough about that, let's talk about Reddit. I've seen some posts that make fun of a widespread type of post and they get voted down, but for some reason, this one went into the stars. Can someone please explain how Reddit works? And what's up with the "invisible rain" glitch happening again? I can hear the rain and see the splashes on the ground, but no drops in the air. All mods removed, only the "loading cutscene remover" mod still present, but it's never given me any problems before. Back to the old tricks, huh? :D Oh, and speaking of tricks, I checked the delivery window again and the end date is indeed November 5. And can we talk about that guy who thinks the second sword is in case the first one breaks? Like, what kind of logic is that? And what are these decks about? Are they in-game or is this coming on a physical drive? Did I f*** myself by ordering it through GoG thinking it would be only digital? I'm a physical copies guy, so this is kind of a big deal for me. But let's get back to the Witcher. I hate seeing people asking for help or directions and then getting downvoted or shown a middle finger. Like, come on, guys, be nice. We're all here to enjoy the game and help each other out. And can someone tell me how to use the sign for face swapping? And how do I make the rain thicker? And what's up with the vsync? I rarely need it and prefer the extra fps, but it's still a good tip. And can we talk about the details in this game? The colors are amazing, but how did you achieve them? And the light shafts and bloom can be a bit too much at times. Wish godrays were like in GTA V - subtle, but still visible. And Geralt's regular hair is SO DAMN GOOD. The details in this game still make me drool over its screenshots. But let's not forget about the gameplay. While it can be hard at times, it's far from trial and error. It just requires a lot of jumping around to dodge. And speaking of dodging, why limit your moves while fighting? It makes no sense realistically looking. And can we talk about Rouch? "Mai naem is Rouch and I wil be ur guide to Randomville." Classic. And let's not forget about the loot. I always go for 55% and most of the time I drop to 30% before I score a deal. A few times I refused the extra coin as I felt the NPC needed the money more than me. And speaking of NPCs, I simply could not turn down those pretty eyes and silky voice of Yen. Maybe it's because I prefer more regular girls compared to the skinny models, but damn, she's fine. And finally, let's talk about reviews. Film critics don't make movies, but their job is to review them. So why do people get so upset when game critics give a game a low score? It's just their opinion, man. And don't even get me started on people who repost the same thing over and over again. Use the search functionality, people. In conclusion, the Witcher 3 is an amazing game with amazing details and gameplay. But let's not forget to be nice to each other and enjoy the natural moment. And seriously, can someone explain how Reddit works?
