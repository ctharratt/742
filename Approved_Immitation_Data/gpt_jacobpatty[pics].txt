I never thought I would end up as an eye retrieval technician. It wasn't something I had planned for, but life has a funny way of taking you down unexpected paths. And now, here I am, cutting out corneas from donors and sending them off to where they're needed. It's a strange job, but it's also incredibly rewarding. Knowing that the work I do can help someone see again is a feeling that's hard to describe. And while it may seem morbid to some, to me, it's just another part of my job. It all starts with a call from the call center. They provide me with all the basic information on the person, their consent forms, hospital account numbers, and everything else I need to know. Then, I head over to the hospital where the person is at. This could be right in my hometown or up to a two-hour drive away, which is never fun at 2:30 in the morning! Once I get there, I head up to the nurses' station and get their files. I have to read through all of those to look for any kind of disease or other affliction that might make them unsuitable for transplant. It's a lengthy process, but it's necessary to ensure that the corneas I retrieve are safe for transplant. Next, I head down to where the body is, usually in the morgue (although sometimes they are still in the hospital beds they passed away in). I get all my equipment set out and ready, then I perform a full body assessment on them to check for any evidence of drug use, swollen liver, or different rashes and such. Once I've determined that the person is fit for transplant, I have to draw enough blood for two sample tubes. This can be a lot harder than you'd think if the person has been gone for a while! But it's a necessary step to ensure that the corneas are a good match for the recipient. Then, I get my sterile field set up and have everything in place to do the actual removal of the corneas. I've gotta go through a whole lengthy hand washing procedure, then put on three consecutive pairs of sterile gloves, as well as sterile sleeves. I bring out my tools and put a sterile cover on the person that only leaves their eyes showing. Then, I basically hold the eyelids open with a clamp, cut a ring around the sclera, usually leaving a 3mm rim of sclera on it so I don't mess up the cornea. Then, I slowly lift the cornea off with tweezers, and make sure to pull the iris off the bottom of it. It's a delicate process, but it's one that I've become quite skilled at over the years. And while it may seem gruesome to some, to me, it's just another day at the office. Of course, there are times when things don't go as planned. Sometimes, the corneas aren't suitable for transplant, or there are other complications that arise. But even in those situations, I know that I'm doing everything I can to help those in need. And that's what keeps me going, day after day. Knowing that the work I do can make a difference in someone's life is a feeling that's hard to describe. It's what makes this job so rewarding, even in the face of death and loss. Of course, there are also moments of levity in this job. Like the time I realized that the Mona Lisa had a veil thing on her head that I had never noticed before. Or the time I discovered frozen apricot cups and fell in love with them. But those moments are few and far between. Most of the time, I'm focused on the task at hand, doing everything I can to ensure that the corneas I retrieve are safe and effective for transplant. And while it may not be the most glamorous job in the world, it's one that I'm proud to do. Because at the end of the day, I know that the work I do can make a real difference in someone's life. And that's all the motivation I need to keep going, day after day.
