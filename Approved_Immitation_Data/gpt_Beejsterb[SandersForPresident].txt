I can feel the tension in the air. The Democratic primaries are heating up, and the stakes have never been higher. As a Bernie supporter, I'm on edge. I know that if he loses, there will be a huge divide on Reddit. But I'm not giving up hope just yet. We still have a chance to win delegates in South Carolina, even if we lose the state. We can't afford to give up now. I'm not alone in my anxiety. Many of us are wondering how we're polling in the Super Tuesday states. How come Clinton is up by six whole delegates when there's only a small difference in the vote? What website should we go to for results? We can't afford another Iowa. We need to stay informed and engaged. It's frustrating to see Bernie running for the Democratic nomination even though he's not officially a Democrat. But that's just the way it is. We have to work with the system we have, not the one we wish we had. And that means we need to get out there and vote. I'm not sure what the Other category FTW does, but I'm all for it. We need to shake things up and challenge the status quo. That's what Bernie is all about. He's bringing up great historical events to support what he's saying. I was thrilled when he finally brought up Mossadegh. As an Iranian, I'm so happy to see him getting the recognition he deserves. But not everyone is on board with Bernie. Some people hate Carson, and I'm not sure why. I don't know much about him, but I googled him and he won a Nobel Peace Prize. That's pretty impressive. And Kissinger may be controversial, but Bernie is bringing up some great points about historical events. We need to pay attention to what he's saying. It's frustrating to see the media ignoring the in-between people. America isn't just white or black anymore. What about the others? There are millions of Americans who don't belong to a single race anymore. We need to talk about them too. Obama is half African American, but what about people who are half white? Are they put in a separate category? We need to start acknowledging the diversity of our country. I'm not sure why Hillary is wearing a Snuggy. Maybe she's cold? But Bernie forgot to talk about African Americans, and that's a problem. We need to make sure that everyone's voices are heard. We can't afford to leave anyone behind. It's frustrating to see the billionaires getting all the attention. But we can't let that discourage us. We need to keep fighting for what we believe in. And we need to share videos like crazy. This is a huge moment in our country's history, and we can't afford to miss it. I'm not sure if there's a mega thread or not. I'm just trying to stay informed. Millsfield and Concord5 have had some wacky results for both parties. NH looks good, but what happened in Iowa? Did we lose? And how are the Nevada polls? We need to stay on top of things if we want to win. I'm from Canada, and I'm proud to support Bernie. But we need to stop attacking Clinton's Facebook page. It's not helping our cause. We need to stay focused and positive. And we need to remember that there's more than one New Hampshire. We can't afford to make mistakes like that. I know that if Bernie loses, there will be a huge divide on Reddit. But we can't give up hope. We still have a chance to win delegates in South Carolina, even if we lose the state. We need to stay informed, engaged, and positive. We can't afford to let this opportunity slip away.
