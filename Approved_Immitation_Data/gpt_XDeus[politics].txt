I used to be a huge supporter of President Obama. I was one of those people who believed in his message of hope and change. I was excited to see what he could do for our country. But over the years, my enthusiasm has waned. There are several reasons why I no longer support him as much as I used to. Firstly, there's Guantanamo Bay. When Obama was running for president, he promised to close down the detention center. But it's still open, and there are still prisoners being held there without trial. This is a clear violation of human rights, and it's disappointing that Obama hasn't followed through on his promise. Secondly, there's the issue of marijuana reform. Obama has said that he believes in the medical benefits of marijuana, but he hasn't done much to change the laws surrounding it. Marijuana is still illegal at the federal level, and people are still being arrested and imprisoned for using it. This is a waste of resources and a violation of personal freedom. Thirdly, Obamacare has been watered down. When the Affordable Care Act was first passed, it was supposed to be a comprehensive healthcare reform that would provide coverage for all Americans. But the final version of the law was much weaker than what was originally proposed. Many people are still uninsured, and the cost of healthcare is still too high. Fourthly, there's the lack of accountability towards those in charge of the economic collapse. When the financial crisis hit in 2008, many people lost their homes and their jobs. But the people who caused the crisis were never held accountable. No one went to jail, and the banks that caused the crisis were bailed out with taxpayer money. This is a clear injustice, and it's disappointing that Obama hasn't done more to hold these people accountable. Finally, there's the issue of the NSA. The revelations about the government's surveillance programs have been shocking. It's clear that the government has been spying on its own citizens, and this is a clear violation of our privacy rights. Obama has defended these programs, and it's disappointing that he hasn't done more to protect our privacy. Despite all of these issues, the Republicans still paint Obama as a socialist. This is ridiculous. Obama is a centrist Democrat who has done very little to challenge the status quo. He's not a socialist, and it's disappointing that the Republicans continue to use this label as a way to attack him. One issue that I find particularly frustrating is the lack of action on immigration reform. There are millions of undocumented immigrants living in the United States, and they are being treated as second-class citizens. They are denied basic rights and protections, and they are often exploited by their employers. This is a clear injustice, and it's disappointing that Obama hasn't done more to address this issue. The Republicans like to blame immigrants for taking away American jobs, but the real problem is the import/export laws that allow companies to maximize profits at the expense of American workers. If we want to create more jobs for Americans, we need to raise the minimum wage to a level that people can actually live on. Companies like Walmart make billions of dollars in profit every year, but their workers rely on government assistance just to survive. This is unacceptable. There's also the issue of the penny. It's time to get rid of it. It's a waste of resources, and it's not even worth the metal it's made of. But Congress is too busy with other issues to eliminate it. However, Obama could change the material that the penny is made from. If it were made of paper, retailers would abandon it and start rounding to the nickel on their own. In conclusion, I still support some of Obama's policies, but my enthusiasm has waned over the years. There are several issues that I find disappointing, including Guantanamo Bay, marijuana reform, Obamacare, lack of accountability towards those in charge of the economic collapse, and the NSA. It's frustrating that the Republicans continue to paint him as a socialist, when he's really a centrist Democrat. We need to address issues like immigration reform and the minimum wage if we want to create a better future for all Americans. And it's time to get rid of the penny.
