As the race for the Democratic nomination heats up, the divide between supporters of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton becomes more apparent. It's no secret that young people overwhelmingly prefer Sanders over Clinton, as evidenced by the results of the Iowa entrance polls, where Sanders received 84% of the under 29 year old vote. This demographic is also heavily represented on social media, particularly on Reddit, where Sanders has a strong following. It's not surprising that a website populated by Sanders' main demographic would support him, but what is surprising is the level of passion and dedication that his supporters have shown. Sanders' message of income inequality and campaign finance reform has resonated with young people who are struggling to find jobs and pay off student loans. They see him as a candidate who is not beholden to big money interests and who truly cares about the issues that affect them. Clinton, on the other hand, is seen as a candidate who is too cozy with Wall Street and who has flip-flopped on important issues such as gay marriage and the Keystone XL pipeline. Despite these differences, many Sanders supporters have said that they would vote for Clinton if she were to receive the nomination. This is not because they believe she is the best candidate, but because they fear what a Republican president would do to the progress that has been made under President Obama. Sanders himself has said that he would support Clinton if she were the nominee, but he has also made it clear that he will continue to fight for his message and his supporters. One of the main criticisms of Sanders is that he is a "joke" candidate who has no chance of winning the nomination. This is simply not true. While Clinton currently has more pledged delegates and is polling higher in other states, Sanders has shown that he can win in states like New Hampshire and has the momentum to continue to do well in upcoming primaries. It's also important to note that the older generation tends to vote for Clinton, while the younger generation supports Sanders. If Sanders does not get the nomination, it's not because he is a joke, but because the older generation gets their candidate instead of the younger generation getting who they want. One issue that has been raised by Clinton supporters is the need for a strong military. While Sanders has said that he supports a strong military, he has also said that he believes in diplomacy and that the United States should not be the world's policeman. As someone who lives near the Canadian border, I understand the fear of not having a strong military, but I also believe that we need to find a balance between defense and diplomacy. Another issue that has been raised is the fear that Sanders will not be able to get things done due to obstruction from Congress. While this is a valid concern, it's important to remember that Sanders has a long history of working across the aisle and getting things done. He has also said that he will use the bully pulpit of the presidency to rally the American people behind his message and put pressure on Congress to act. One of the most interesting aspects of the Sanders campaign is the way that it has mobilized young people and created a new generation of leaders who are more in tune with what the people want. Sanders' aim to fix campaign finance could open the door to new generations of leaders who are not beholden to big money interests and who truly care about the issues that affect ordinary Americans. This could lead to "fixing everything" in the long run and create a more just and equitable society. As the race for the Democratic nomination continues, it's important to remember that momentum is a factor. Sanders has shown that he can win in states like New Hampshire and has the momentum to continue to do well in upcoming primaries. However, it's also important to be realistic about what is ahead and to be prepared for a loss in Nevada or South Carolina. If Sanders does not win the nomination, it's important to continue to fight for his message and his supporters and to work towards creating a more just and equitable society. In conclusion, the Sanders campaign has mobilized young people and created a new generation of leaders who are more in tune with what the people want. While Clinton currently has more pledged delegates and is polling higher in other states, Sanders has shown that he can win in states like New Hampshire and has the momentum to continue to do well in upcoming primaries. If Sanders does not win the nomination, it's important to continue to fight for his message and his supporters and to work towards creating a more just and equitable society.
