Milwaukee has a rich history when it comes to movie theaters. From the old Westlane on Hwy100 to the recently built Majestic, the city has seen its fair share of theaters come and go. However, one area that has been underserved for many years is the Southridge area. Before the Southridge Mall lost its movie theater, the closest theater for new movies was either on 13th street or Mooreland Rd. There were closer budget options, but for those looking for a more upscale experience, the options were limited. The Southridge area has been in need of a high-quality movie theater for decades, and it seems that Marcus Theaters is finally stepping up to the plate. The new theater will need to be a Majestic-type movie theater with restaurants and other amenities to create a unique experience for moviegoers. Marcus knows that they have to up their game due to the short period of time between theater release and DVD release. If they don't create a unique experience, the theater could become a magnet for trouble, much like Mayfair's movie theater. Mayfair's movie theater is an example of how not to do it. The experience is horrible, and many people avoid it altogether. The theater is located in a junky/mishmoshy area, and traffic is a mess around there. The Southridge area needs a theater that is well-placed and well-designed to attract moviegoers. The new theater will need to be located in an area that is easily accessible to people living in the Southridge area. Geographically speaking, the theater should be close enough to the mall to attract moviegoers, but not so close that it becomes a nuisance. The theater should be located in an area that is well-lit and well-maintained to ensure the safety of moviegoers. The theater should also be designed to create a unique experience for moviegoers. The Majestic is a great example of how to do it right. The theater features a full bar, a restaurant, and a lounge area. The theater also features state-of-the-art sound and projection systems to create an immersive experience for moviegoers. The Southridge area has been underserved for many years, and a high-quality movie theater could be an asset to the surrounding community. The theater could attract new businesses to the area and create jobs for local residents. It could also provide a safe and enjoyable entertainment option for families in the area. In addition to a new movie theater, the Southridge area could benefit from other amenities as well. The area could use more restaurants, shops, and entertainment options to attract visitors and create a vibrant community. The Public Market is a great example of how to create a vibrant community space. The market features a variety of vendors selling fresh produce, meats, cheeses, and other goods. The market also features a variety of restaurants and cafes, making it a great place to grab a bite to eat. Milwaukee has a lot to offer, and there are many great places to visit in the city. The Wisconsin Go Hiking Club offers hikes almost every single day, providing a great way to explore the city's natural beauty. The city also has a variety of book clubs and writing groups, providing opportunities to meet new people and explore new ideas. Milwaukee is also home to a variety of great neighborhoods, each with its own unique character. The East Side, Lower East Side, and Third Ward areas are all great places to live, with plenty of restaurants, shops, and entertainment options. Riverwest is another trendy neighborhood, but it is rated R due to crime and may not be the best option for those unfamiliar with the area. Milwaukee has a rich history, and there are many great places to explore in the city. The city's many museums and galleries offer a glimpse into the city's past and present. The Milwaukee Art Museum is a great place to explore the city's art scene, with a variety of exhibits and events throughout the year. Milwaukee is also home to a variety of great parks and outdoor spaces. The city's many parks offer a variety of activities, from hiking and biking to picnicking and fishing. The city's lakefront is also a great place to explore, with miles of trails and beaches to enjoy. Milwaukee is a great place to live, work, and play. The city has a lot to offer, from its rich history to its vibrant neighborhoods and entertainment options. With a new movie theater in the works, the Southridge area is poised to become an even more vibrant and exciting place to live and visit.
