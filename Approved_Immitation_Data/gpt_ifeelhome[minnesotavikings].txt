The Minnesota Vikings have had a rollercoaster of a season so far, with ups and downs that have left fans on the edge of their seats. As a die-hard Vikings fan, I can't help but feel the massive and throbbingness of next week's game. It's a feeling that makes me want to melt my face off, but in a good way. The excitement is palpable, and I can't wait to see what happens. SB confirmed. Now I can get happy drunk SKOL mofos!! First game in a while I can sit with my drink barely into 4th quarter with a smile on my face. Not that it's over but shit - cheers skoldiers. It's a good feeling. They're just feeling the heat about the whole OBJ thing last week. So they feel they have to do SOMEthing. Giants scored 5 straight touchdowns late in last week's game. For some reason, it feels like AP is cool coming out now. Like when it happens this season he's like "cool. Yeah, I trust our team. I get it." I love it. Haha yes teddy! Now take him out! Fly in the pack. Let's do the ol double header. Walsh you badass motherfucker. Hahaha FTP this is awesome. Hahahhahahahaha omg I'm so drunk I can't wait for the VIKINGS GAME!! The Vikings have had their fair share of struggles this season, but they've also had some shining moments. The team has shown that they have what it takes to compete at a high level, and I believe that they have the potential to go all the way. Of course, there are always going to be obstacles in the way, but I have faith in this team. When you see what Adrian Peterson did to these kids, you won't believe your eyes! Inspiration is for amateurs. It's your job. It's all on the line. If you can't inspire and motivate yourself, it's going to be tough. The only reason I like the scenarios is that it gives me additional teams to cheer for. I agree that we over-analyze every single possible situation, but given we're right in the thick of it, I like to have a reason to cheer for other teams! Do you seriously think AP, or Zimmer, or anyone else is actually afraid of primetime? They probably love the chance to prove themselves. They're not thinking "oh boy, well, gee whiz, I wish we could just keep playing our quiet little noon games where no one will see us." No. They're thinking BRING IT. And we should too. No, he's showing through his pants. It's awkward. Dammit, I just wish he could use his speed and lines with our passing game as well. Fuck the Bucs, Bears, Falcons, Seahawks. Oh, and of course, FTP. As a fan who has moved away from Minnesota, I can't help but feel a sense of nostalgia for the cold weather. When I tell people here in Colorado that I miss the real Minnesota cold, they call me crazy. But I just really like the brisk, brisk cold. Memories of snowmobiling up north and the freezing wind hitting your face. It's refreshing. Anyone else who's moved away feel this too? Kalil's not bad in my book - but he's no Dwight Freeney. He's going to get beat by players like that. I think a more experienced QB feels pressure like that, and I think it was a weird call to have Teddy hang on that long anyway. I don't want to force a certain attitude on a player when he just generally doesn't have it (i.e. Teddys not your classic scream and spike and dance around kinda qb), but I agree it was good to see some fire. We need to keep it going. We've lost two straight. We need to finally get back in it and start winning. The Vikings have had some tough losses this season, but they've also had some great wins. It's important to remember that this is a team that is still learning and growing. They have the potential to be a dominant force in the league, but they need to stay focused and keep working hard. I'm totally ok with 10-6. Big improvement from last year. Make the playoffs. And get the easiest first-round game. Edit: listen, you jerks, I'm allowed to not do any research and make kool-aid fueled predictions that are not founded in anything but my love for the purple so y'all can go to hell!! What's the over/under for how many "who do we draft" threads for the next week? Completely agree, but in this situation, he just can't hold on to the ball that long. We've seen it in other games, and it's his inexperience showing. He had a great outing today, but he's gotta learn you can't just sit there for 3 seconds hanging on to the ball. Wtf are you talking about? We are not a team like the Packers or the Patriots. We weren't supposed to win this game. It wasn't supposed to be close. We kept it close and had the ball in our hands last to try to win. You can't enjoy a great game? Do you play for the team? For fucks sake man - I'm sick of all the "there are no moral victories" bullshit. We're fans. We don't get paid to play the game. We watch because we're vikes fans. And tomorrow we'll all go back to work and the rest of our lives. Yes - I agree with OP it does hurt so good. Hard to lose but we showed them what we're made of and it wasn't enough. Get off your high horse. Hard to win with that TO disparity for sure. It's a bummer because Teddy had one of his best games of the season, and his team couldn't pull it out. I'm gonna puke. But man, our team looked great today. And without a defense that would've for certain prevented one of those touchdowns. We still have a chance at 8-5. With this kind of game, we have a great chance of taking the next two games. SKOL. And fuck the pack. Edit: what I mean is a chance at the playoffs at our current record of 8-5! I'm definitely gonna look back and say wow this team looked awesome today. But for now, I could crawl into my closet and cry myself to sleep. Harris with the pick. We sure could use a turnover here. Wallace playing the long con this season. SKOL Hell yeah guys! Tie game against a great team. We get the ball at half. Key defensive players out. Teddy lookin good. APs got 60 on the ground. SKOL! Don't even care. Love his Minnesota ties. Flea flicker to Patterson on first and 10 next possession. There's already a difference from last week's game. That first drive was awesome. We have it in us! SKOL! Don't get his spirits up too much...we're not as good as we think we are. 8-5 still gives us a real chance of getting to 10 wins and into the playoffs. I don't think they're using the deep ball in the right places. When AP busts for 12, throw it up on 1st and 10. He'll have more time with the threat of Adrian anyway. I feel like I've seen some weird 2nd and 3rd down calls for the deep ball. I love that Teddy's so even-keeled, but god I hope he comes out angry on Thursday. He's starting to realize that he's losing some cred, but he's got the talent! Come out blazing Throwsevelt! Only upside - we can do some crazy shit this game... Patterson could have an explosive game. Give AP the ball 40 times. Throw in some ridiculous defensive schemes. Fake punts. SKOL. Absolutely. If we need to throw some unconventional stuff out there, let's do it. Now would be the time. Look at the pass Amendola threw to Tom Brady for 40 yards or whatever. They still lost - but even the Patriots are going unconventional when their threats are all out. If the o-line has a signature game, it'll be much more likely Teddy can have a signature game. But I agree - Teddy needs a 300 yds 3 TD kind of game. Best case would be Cardinals beat Seahawks and Packers in weeks 16-17. We win against Bears/Giants and take the Packers at Lambeau to win the division. It's a stretch, but technically possible. BUT - I think I'd rather play Washington as the 5th seed and watch the Packers/Seahawks take each other out. Not going to be easy, but if we beat Bears, Giants, and Pack at Lambeau, we take the division. Assuming Pack only loses one more as their remaining schedule is pretty easy. I'm sick of people calling for heads and firings when we're clearly still in the hunt for the division. Don't even care if you're saying fire them next year. We're in the hunt... I'm not telling you what you can/can't post I'm only telling you if after a loss that many expected us to lose you're losing your shit calling for people's heads and saying we're done I think you're a fair-weather fan and think you likely haven't seen that many seasons of football. In conclusion, the Vikings have had their ups and downs this season, but they're still in the hunt for the division.
