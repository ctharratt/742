In 1992, a monumental discovery was made by astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail. They had discovered two planets orbiting a pulsar, marking the first confirmed discovery of extrasolar planets. This discovery was a major breakthrough in the field of astronomy and sparked a new era of exploration and discovery. The pulsar, now known as Lich, and its planets, Draugr, Poltergeist, and Phobetor, were selected by the International Astronomical Union as part of their public process for giving proper names to exoplanets and their host star. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names, and in December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names. But this discovery was not the first of its kind. In 1988, the first exoplanet, Tadmor, was discovered, but it couldn't be confirmed as a planet until 2002. This discovery paved the way for future discoveries and led to the development of new technologies and techniques for detecting exoplanets. The search for exoplanets has become a major focus in astronomy, with scientists using a variety of methods to detect them. One of the most common methods is the transit method, which involves observing a star and looking for a dip in its brightness as a planet passes in front of it. Another method is the radial velocity method, which involves observing the star's motion and looking for small changes in its velocity caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. But the search for exoplanets is not just about discovering new worlds. It is also about understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems, and how they relate to our own solar system. By studying exoplanets, scientists can learn more about the conditions necessary for life to exist, and potentially discover new forms of life beyond Earth. In addition to the search for exoplanets, astronomers are also studying the properties of pulsars, which are rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit beams of radiation. Pulsars are some of the most extreme objects in the universe, with densities that are millions of times greater than that of ordinary matter. They are also incredibly precise clocks, with some pulsars rotating hundreds of times per second. The study of pulsars has led to a better understanding of the behavior of matter under extreme conditions, and has also provided a new tool for studying the structure of the universe. By observing the timing of pulsar signals, astronomers can detect the presence of gravitational waves, which are ripples in the fabric of spacetime caused by the motion of massive objects. But the study of pulsars and exoplanets is not just about scientific discovery. It is also about inspiring the next generation of scientists and explorers. The search for exoplanets and the study of pulsars capture the imagination and inspire wonder about the universe and our place in it. One of the most fascinating aspects of astronomy is the sheer scale of the universe. The distances between stars and galaxies are so vast that they are difficult to comprehend. But this vastness also means that there is an almost infinite number of worlds to explore and discover. The search for exoplanets and the study of pulsars are just the beginning of a new era of exploration and discovery. With new technologies and techniques being developed all the time, there is no telling what we will discover next. But one thing is certain: the universe is full of wonders, and there is still so much to learn and explore.
