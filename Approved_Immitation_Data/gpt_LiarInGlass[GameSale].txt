Hey there! I'm interested in the New 3DS XL that you have for sale. Is it still available? If so, I would prefer the black one. I can pay via PayPal, but I'm currently at work and won't be able to do so until tomorrow. I have Saturday off, so we could finish the transaction then if that works for you. I noticed that you mentioned accepting Amazon as well. Do you accept Amazon gift cards? I share a PayPal account with someone else, so Amazon would be easier for me. I can do an electronic gift card right now if that works for you. Just let me know. I've been on the lookout for a good deal on the New 3DS for a while now, so I'm definitely interested in purchasing from you. I've been a member of this community for almost five years and have done a lot of trades and sales, so you can check my feedback if you'd like. I'm located in Texas, so shipping shouldn't be an issue. If we go the Amazon route, I would be willing to offer $155 for the console since we won't have to deal with fees. However, if you prefer PayPal, that's fine too. Just let me know. Before we finalize the transaction, could you please send me some pictures of the item? I want to make sure it's in good condition before I make the purchase. Thanks for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you soon! Update: Thanks for sending over the pictures! That's the exact model I had before I sold it, so I'm going to wait until I can find a new one. I'm really looking for the New 3DS XL instead of the regular one. Thanks for your time though! Hey there! I noticed that you have a 3DS XL for sale. Is it still available? If so, I'm definitely interested. However, I'm looking for the New 3DS XL specifically. If the 3DS XL is in good condition and sold at a good price, I would still consider purchasing it though. Could you please send me some pictures of the SNES and controllers? I'm interested in purchasing those as well. Thanks for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you soon! Update: Thanks for sending over the pictures! I'm going to have to pass on the SNES and controllers for now, but I appreciate your time. Hey there! I noticed that you have a PS2 and PS3 for sale. I'm interested in both, but could you please send me some pictures of the items? I want to make sure they're in good condition before I make the purchase. Thanks for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you soon! Update: Thanks for sending over the pictures! I'm definitely interested in the PS2 bundle. However, I'm still deciding on the PS3. Could you please let me know what you're asking for it? Hey there! I noticed that you have a 3DS for sale. I'm interested, but I was wondering if you have the box or anything for it? I'm willing to pay $120 shipped for the console and SSB if you don't have the box. However, if you do have the box, I would be willing to pay more. I know you're asking for $130, but I could just grab a refurbished system from Nintendo with a whole year warranty in case of issues from them from the Nintendo Store online for the same price you're asking. Let me know if you're willing to work something out. Thanks for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you soon! Update: Thanks for letting me know that you don't have the box. I'm still interested in purchasing, but would you be willing to drop the price down to $125? That would beat the Nintendo store price and leave me with some extra money for shipping. Hey there! I noticed that you're looking for some unicorns. What are you specifically looking for? I might be able to help you out. Thanks for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you soon! Update: Thanks for letting me know what you're looking for. Unfortunately, I don't have any of those at the moment. If I come across any, I'll definitely let you know. Hey there! I just sent over payment for the New 3DS XL. Could you please confirm and add tracking info in a PM and on PayPal? You can do so by going into the info of the payment and adding shipping details. Thanks for your time and I look forward to receiving the item soon! Update: Thanks for confirming and adding the tracking info! I appreciate your promptness. Hey there! I noticed that you have some amiibos for sale. I'm interested in Bowser, SSB Luigi, and SMB Luigi and Yoshi if they're all NIB and in good condition. Would you be willing to work out a deal since I'm interested in purchasing all of them? Thanks for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you soon! Update: Thanks for letting me know that they're all NIB and in good condition. I'm willing to pay $45 for all of them. After shipping, that will leave me with close to $40 to use for what I need. Let me know if you're willing to do that. Hey there! I noticed that you have some Wave 4 amiibos available for purchase or trade. I'm definitely interested in purchasing or trading for some. I'm not a scalper, so I'm not looking to jack up the prices a lot. For Marth, I think $30 is a good general price. I'm willing to pay $60 for both NA NIB Lucina and Marth. I have Marth in hand, and I'll have a Lucina on release day. Both NA and NIB. You can check my feedback if needed. Thanks for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you soon! Update: Thanks for letting me know that you're willing to sell both for $60. I'm definitely interested in purchasing. Let me know when you have the Lucina in hand and we can finalize the transaction.

Thanks for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you soon! Update: Thanks for letting me know that you're willing to accept an Amazon gift card. I'm still deciding on whether or not I can make the purchase, but if it's still available by tomorrow, I'll definitely let you know. Hey there! I noticed that you're selling a code for a game that can be shipped via Amazon. I'm interested, but I'm a little confused on how it works. Could you please explain it to me? Thanks for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you soon! Update: Thanks for explaining how it works. I'm still deciding on whether or not I want to make the purchase, but I appreciate your time.
