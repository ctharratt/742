Serves 4 Pot pies are a classic comfort food that never goes out of style. They are perfect for a cozy night in or a family dinner. This recipe for chicken pot pie is easy to follow and will leave you with a delicious and hearty meal. To start, you will need 2 pounds of cooked boneless, skinless chicken that has been shredded. Season the chicken with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. In a large, tall saucepan, melt 4 tablespoons of unsalted butter at room temperature. Add 4 tablespoons of all-purpose flour and whisk to ensure there are no lumps before adding 2 cups of good-quality canned chicken broth. Cook out this mixture for 5-10 minutes while continuously stirring. Check the consistency by dipping the back of a spoon into the sauce and running your finger along the spoon. You want the sauce to cling to the spoon and not run over the swipe you made. Continue to cook and stir the sauce over medium heat until you reach the correct consistency. Season the sauce with the salt, pepper, and cayenne (if using). Taste the sauce and see if your sauce needs more seasoning. Next, add 1-2 tablespoons of heavy cream and stir to combine. Then, add the shredded chicken, 1/2 pound of red-skinned potatoes cut into 1/2-inch pieces, 1/2 pound of carrots peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces, 1 medium yellow onion peeled and diced, 2 minced garlic cloves, and a pinch of cayenne (optional) to the sauce. Cook the vegetables in the sauce for two to three minutes. Transfer the filling into a clean bowl and chill in the fridge for one hour, or until cool. Preheat the oven to 400˚F / 200 ˚C. Roll out approximately 1/2 pound of defrosted puff pastry following package instructions, using a bit of extra flour to ensure the pastry doesn’t stick to your work surface. Use a bowl or plate about an inch larger than the dish you are cooking your pot pie in as a guide to cut out your pastry. Carefully spoon in your chilled filling into your dish. Break 1 large egg in a small dish and add a tablespoon of water or cream. Whisk with a fork and brush this egg wash on the edges of your dish. Brush a little of your egg wash on the rim of your dish. Lay your pastry over the top, being careful not to stretch the pastry. Seal the edges of the pastry by lightly pushing it onto the rim of your dish to make sure it is secure. Then brush the top and sides with more egg wash. Place your pot pies on a large baking sheet and bake for 25-35 minutes. Bake until your pastry is a nice golden, dark brown and there are no more grayish raw patches. Let cool for five minutes before serving. This chicken pot pie recipe is sure to become a family favorite. It is easy to make and can be customized to your liking. You can add different vegetables or even switch out the chicken for beef or turkey. The possibilities are endless. But pot pies aren't the only comfort food out there. There are plenty of other dishes that can warm you up on a cold day or make you feel better when you're feeling down. Here are a few of my favorites: Apple Tart This apple tart recipe is simple and delicious. You will need 2/3 cup of all-purpose flour, 3 tablespoons of cold unsalted butter cut into 3 equal pieces, 1 tablespoon of canola oil, 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, 1/8 teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of ice-cold water, and 2 apples cut into slices. For the topping, you will need 2 tablespoons of sugar and 3 tablespoons of butter cut into small cubes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. For the dough, put the flour, butter, oil, sugar, and salt in a food processor and process for about 10 seconds, add the tablespoon of ice water and process for another five or six seconds, then remove from the bowl and form into a flat dough. Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and then refrigerate for 20-30 minutes. Lightly flour a work surface and roll the ball of dough into a thin layer, around 1/4 inch thick. Using a round cutter, or use a round bowl or lid as a guide and cut out into a nice round circle. Carefully transfer the dough to a large cookie sheet lined with a nonstick baking mat. Arrange the apple slices, alternating them nicely on top of the dough. Sprinkle the apple with sugar and put butter cubes on top. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the fruit is soft and the dough nicely browned. Some of the juice from the fruit will have leaked out onto the cookie sheet. Before it hardens and makes the disks stick to the sheet, lift the tart with a broad spatula and transfer them to a cooling rack or platter. Serve lukewarm or at room temperature with ice cream (optional). Breakfast Egg Muffins These breakfast egg muffins are perfect for meal prep or a quick breakfast on the go. You will need 6 oz of kielbasa sliced and quartered, 1/2 cup of diced onion, 1/2 cup of diced green pepper, 12 eggs, 3 oz of shredded cheese, and cooking spray. Brown the kielbasa in a pan, remove and add onion and green pepper. Cook until onion is tender. Spray a muffin tin (with 12 slots) with cooking spray. Put kielbasa and onion pepper mix on the bottom. Whisk the eggs, add salt and pepper, and pour over kielbasa and onion pepper mix. Top with cheese and bake at 325 for 20 minutes. Cheesy Pretzel Strawberry Jell-O Salad This cheesy pretzel strawberry Jell-O salad is a unique and delicious dessert that is sure to impress. You will need a 6 oz package of strawberry Jell-O, 2 cups of boiling water, 2 cups of salted pretzels (before crushing), 1/4 cup of granulated sugar, 1 stick (8 Tbsp) of unsalted butter, 8 oz of cream cheese softened, 1/2 cup of granulated sugar, 8 oz tub of cool whip thawed in the fridge, and 1 lb of fresh strawberries hulled and sliced. Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine strawberry Jell-O with 2 cups boiling water and stir until completely dissolved. Set aside to cool to room temp. Crush pretzels in a sturdy ziploc bag, using a rolling pin. In a medium saucepan, melt butter then add 1/4 cup sugar and stir. Mix in crushed pretzels. Transfer to a 13x9 glass casserole dish, pressing evenly over the bottom of the dish and bake 10 min at 350°F, then cool to room temp. While pretzel mix is cooling, use a hand mixer to beat cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar on med/high speed until fluffy and white. Fold in cool whip and spread over cooled pretzel crust.
