Dragon Ball Z is a classic anime that has been loved by fans for decades. The show has been through many iterations, from the original manga to the anime series, and now to the latest installment, Dragon Ball Super. Fans have been eagerly anticipating the release of the English dub of Dragon Ball Super, and there has been a lot of speculation about what the show will be like. One of the biggest questions that fans have been asking is what the word "Pinchi" means. This word has been used in the show, but it is not clear what it refers to. Some fans have speculated that it is a new term for a power level, while others think it might be a new type of transformation. Whatever it is, fans are excited to find out more about it. Another topic that has been on fans' minds is the quality of the animation in Dragon Ball Super. Many fans were disappointed with the animation in the early episodes of the show, but there is hope that the Blu-ray release will feature improved animation. Some fans have even said that they will wait to watch the English dub until the Blu-ray is released. There has also been a lot of discussion about the voices in Dragon Ball Super. Some fans prefer the original voices from the Japanese version, while others think that the voices in the English dub are better. There is no right or wrong answer, as it is a matter of personal preference. One character that has been a topic of discussion is Mr. Popo. Fans have been amazed by his speed and agility, and some have even joked that he would be great at tennis. Another character that has creeped out fans is Cell, with his creepy joint sounds and eerie introduction. Fans have also been excited about the return of Dragon Ball Z to Toonami. For many fans, Toonami was where they first discovered the show as children, and it holds a special place in their hearts. While some have complained that there is no point in watching the show on Toonami if they already own the Blu-ray, others see it as a chance to relive their childhood memories. There has also been speculation about the future of Dragon Ball Super. Fans have wondered if there will be a second round to decide who is the strongest being of both universes, and if there will be tournaments between dimensional characters. Some fans have even come up with their own ideas for a Dragon Ball Z video game, with levels based on different seasons and power-ups based on Super Saiyan upgrades. One character that has been a topic of discussion is Vegeta. Fans have wondered why he cares about Goku, and some have speculated that it is because of his Saiyan blood. Others think that he used to respect Goku when he went Super Saiyan 2 and killed Cell, but that he no longer respects him as a scholar. There has also been discussion about the English dub of Dragon Ball Super. Some fans have chosen to wait for the English dub before making any judgments about the show, while others have already seen the Japanese version and have formed their own opinions. Some fans have even speculated about what the show will be like once it is dubbed in English. Overall, Dragon Ball Z is a beloved anime that has captured the hearts of fans around the world. With the release of Dragon Ball Super, fans have been eagerly anticipating the next chapter in the story of Goku and his friends. While there has been some disappointment with the animation and voices in the show, fans remain hopeful that the show will continue to be a classic for years to come.
