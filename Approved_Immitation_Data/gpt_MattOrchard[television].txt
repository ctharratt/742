Oh my god, did you guys hear the news? South Park got renewed for three more seasons! I mean, I know it's not really surprising considering how popular the show is, but it's still great to hear. And Comedy Central deserves some major props for sticking with quality over ratings. I mean, they could have easily just gone for the easy laughs and cheap jokes, but they didn't. They stuck with Trey and Matt and their vision, and it's paid off big time. But here's the thing that's been bugging me - how is it that so many people still don't know about this amazing show? I mean, I get that it's not for everyone, but come on. It's been on for over 20 years now, and it's still one of the funniest and most relevant shows on TV. And yet, news of its renewal generates enough enthusiasm to get upvoted to the front page? What gives? And don't even get me started on the new guy they hired. I mean, I'm sure he's talented and all, but he's only been with the show for a few months and he's already been promoted to a full-time writer? That seems like a pretty big gamble to me. I mean, sure, he's young and fresh and all that, but what if he can't handle the pressure? What if he can't come up with the same level of biting satire and social commentary that Trey and Matt have been delivering for years? And speaking of biting satire, can we talk about how sometimes the show relies too much on source material? I mean, don't get me wrong, I love it when they take on current events and news stories and all that, but sometimes it feels like they're just playing clips from a serious report and commenting on them without really making a joke. Or if they do make a joke, it's a really feeble one. It's like they're disguising commentary as satire, you know? Take that recent segment where they just kept showing that video of Keifer Sutherland jumping on a Christmas tree. I mean, yeah, it was funny the first time, but after the third or fourth time, it just got old. And it felt like they were just trying to fill time or something. And don't even get me started on the TV Evangelist bit. That was pure gold. But it's not all bad, you know? If you go back and watch some of the random episodes from seasons 4-9, you'll see that the quality hasn't really dropped that much. Sure, it's not as groundbreaking as it used to be, but it's still one of the funniest shows on TV. In fact, I'd say that South Park's quality arch goes something like this: seasons 1-3 were irreverent and groundbreaking, seasons 4-9 were the best show that has ever been on television, seasons 10-13ish were not as good as its peak era but still the funniest show currently on television, and seasons 14-present are good relative to other TV comedies but no longer the funniest show on TV. I mean, don't get me wrong, I still love the show and I'll definitely keep watching, but I think it's time for Trey and Matt to move on to other things. And that's where the new guy comes in, I guess. Maybe he'll bring some fresh ideas and perspectives to the show. Maybe he'll be the one to take it to the next level. Or maybe he'll just be another writer who comes and goes without making much of an impact. Who knows? But here's the thing that's been bugging me - why did they hire a 31-year-old virtual unknown who's only done a few segments for them? I mean, that's pretty progressive of them, I guess, but it's also a huge gamble. Maybe they're trying to save money by giving him peanuts for a while and coasting on the brand until he proves himself and they have to give him a raise. Or maybe they're just confident that he won't sink the ship. Either way, it's a risky move. And don't even get me started on how long it takes for Trey and Matt to do anything outside of South Park. I mean, I get that they're committed to the show and all that, but it takes years upon years for any side projects to come to fruition. I'd love it if they had more time to make new things. I mean, everything they've done outside of South Park has been great, from The Book of Mormon to Team America: World Police. And I'm sure they have plenty of other ideas that they just don't have time to work on. But hey, at least we have three more seasons of South Park to look forward to. And who knows? Maybe the new guy will be the one to take the show to the next level. Maybe he'll be the one to bring back that irreverent and groundbreaking spirit that made the show so great in the first place. Or maybe he'll just be another writer who comes and goes without making much of an impact. Either way, I'll be watching.
