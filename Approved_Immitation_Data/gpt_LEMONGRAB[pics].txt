Considering HER username is ElaineMae... Just saying. Gotta stand up for other women Redditors, who are constantly mistaken for overweight older men who still live in their parents basement. Women can be losers too! It's not fair to assume that just because someone is a woman, they automatically have their life together. We all have our struggles and challenges, and it's important to support each other regardless of gender. Hmmm... For some reason when I picture a guy straddling a stationary ice-sculpture... "Bad ass" isn't the way is describe it. I mean, sure, it takes some skill and balance to straddle an ice sculpture, but it's not exactly the most impressive feat. I'd be more impressed if he was doing some crazy acrobatics or something. I hate that game so much... It's SO hard to control that jerk! I'm talking about that stupid game where you have to guide a little dot through a maze without touching the walls. It's so frustrating because the dot moves so fast and it's really hard to control. I've probably spent hours playing that game and I still can't get past the first level. Apparently Reddit is very touchy when it comes to playing miniature-ring chess... I mean, I get it. People are passionate about their hobbies and interests, and they don't like it when others make fun of them or belittle them. But at the same time, it's important to have a sense of humor and not take things too seriously. We're all just here to have fun and connect with others who share our interests. Why are all your girlfriends so grumpy?? I don't know about you, but I've definitely had my fair share of grumpy girlfriends. It's not always easy to deal with, but I think it's important to be patient and understanding. Maybe they're going through something tough and just need some extra support. Or maybe they're just having a bad day and need some space. Either way, it's important to communicate and try to work through any issues together. Yep the beak was the first thing I noticed. The truth is out there. Took me forever too. I kept looking for two big dolphins, but they are small, and there are about 5 of them. All in the negative space around the couple. But they only kinda look like dolphins. It's funny how our brains can play tricks on us like that. We see what we want to see, or what we expect to see, even if it's not really there. It's a good reminder to always keep an open mind and be willing to look at things from different perspectives. Why are you NOT a whale? This is a question that has plagued me for years. I mean, I love whales. They're majestic creatures and they seem so peaceful and serene. But alas, I am not a whale. I'm just a regular old human, trying to make my way in the world. And both accounts are 2 years old. This is something that I find really interesting about Reddit. There are so many users who have been here for years, building up their karma and contributing to the community. It's like a little online family, with its own inside jokes and traditions. I think that's part of what makes Reddit so special. This fish knows trees. I'm not sure what this means, but it sounds like something that would be on a t-shirt or a bumper sticker. Maybe it's a reference to some obscure meme or inside joke that I'm not cool enough to know about. Or maybe it's just a random phrase that someone came up with. Either way, it's kind of funny. Perfect. The way he is holding his hand is begging to have things shopped in. I'm assuming this is a reference to a photo or a meme or something. It's funny how certain images or phrases can become so popular and widespread on the internet. It's like we're all part of this big, interconnected web of inside jokes and references. Until they bite your with their razor-sharp deer teeth. Wait, deer have teeth? I thought they just had those little nubs that they use to chew on grass and leaves. I guess you learn something new every day. You have just received one stamp on your Woosh Card, sir/ma'am. This point will drop off in about a year. Have a nice day and Woosh with caution. I have no idea what this means, but it sounds ominous. Is Woosh some kind of secret society or cult that I'm not aware of? Should I be worried? Did you know? At Subway, ducks eat for free. This is definitely not true, but it's a funny image to imagine. Can you imagine a bunch of ducks waddling into a Subway and ordering sandwiches? It's like something out of a cartoon. The force of the whole car... Which appears to be made of bendy plastic sticks and rubber bands. I'm not sure what kind of car this is, but it sounds like it's not very sturdy. Maybe it's one of those toy cars that kids play with, or maybe it's just a really old and beat-up car. Either way, it doesn't sound like it would hold up very well in a crash. Yeah like the weird pustules all over the dogs mouth and various parts of the primates? That is not something I see when I look in the mirror. I'm not sure what this is referring to, but it sounds gross. I'm not a big fan of pustules or any kind of skin condition, really. Oh my god. That is a real subreddit. I wasn't shocked by the one with "cute dead females", or the one about sex with dogs. But this one shocked me. I'm not sure what subreddit this is referring to, but it sounds like it's something pretty disturbing. It's scary to think that there are people out there who are into some really messed up stuff. The guy on the left has the perfect "white people are silly" look on his face. Edit: I don't know my rights and lefts. This made me laugh out loud. It's so true that sometimes we get our lefts and rights mixed up, especially when we're in a hurry or under stress. But it's important to take a deep breath and slow down, so we don't end up looking silly. To be fair, most girls' boobs aren't symmetrical. This is something that a lot of people don't realize. We tend to think of breasts as these perfectly round, symmetrical objects, but in reality, they come in all shapes and sizes. It's important to remember that everyone's body is different, and there's no such thing as a "perfect" body. Why does she have panty liners under her boobs? This is a question that I've never thought to ask, but now I'm curious. Maybe it's for sweat or chafing? Or maybe it's just a personal preference. Either way, it's interesting to think about the different ways that people take care of their bodies. Weirdest novelty account ever. I'm not sure what this is referring to, but it sounds like it's something that's pretty out there. There are so many different types of accounts on Reddit, from serious and informative to silly and irreverent. It's part of what makes the site so diverse and interesting. Whoa now. Are we talking about James Marsters, like the same actor who played Spike on Buffy The Vampire Slayer?? Because if so, that's really cool and I might have to check that out. He has always been one of my favorite actors. It might take me awhile to get used to his regular accent though... I'm assuming this is a reference to some kind of movie or TV show that James Marsters is in. I'm not familiar with his work, but it sounds like he's a pretty popular actor. I used to have a serious problem with Pepsi. Like drinking 5-6 a day wasn't out of the ordinary. I know it's silly but I really hate drinking water. I can definitely relate to this. I used to be addicted to soda, and I would drink multiple cans a day. It's hard to break the habit, but it's so important for our health. I'm glad that you were able to make a change and start drinking healthier beverages. But when i turned 25 as a 5'4 female, and I stopped to realize my weight got to be around 140 I decided something needed to change. Literally ALL I changed was to stop drinking pop, and I started drinking some of those vitaminwaters that have 0 calories. I know those still aren't the best for you, but it was the closest to water I was willing to get! After about a year and a half I've lost 35 pounds and I feel amazing. Now when I drink the occasional Pepsi it makes me feel terrible. So I think it's great that you've started to wean yourself off of sodas, and definitely think about getting rid of them altogether! This is really inspiring. It's amazing how making small changes to our diet and lifestyle can have such a big impact on our health. I'm glad that you were able to make a positive change and feel better about yourself. I agree completely. And you're right, it doesn't make sense from their standpoint... If I hear sirens, the first thing I do is turn the radio OFF so I can find out which way it's coming from. This is a good point. When we hear sirens, our first instinct is often to turn down the radio or stop talking, so we can hear where the sound is coming from. It's important to be
