WW2 was a crazy time, man. I mean, ship bourne AA? What even was that? It didn't seem to do much good, that's for sure. But maybe things are different now, who knows? I mean, a ship is a pretty big target, right? It's like a sitting duck out there on the ocean. But then again, it's not like it can hide in a jungle or a city, or even underwater for that matter. So, if you have air superiority, you're pretty much in control of the battlefield. But what if your enemy can hide? I mean, sure, they might be more careful if they know there's a threat, but who knows? And then there's the whole treaty thing. I think the UK inherits the legal instrument or something like that. But back in the day, our land mass was huge. We had Canada, Australia, India...the sun never set on the British Empire, you know? But I guess that's all in the past now. Speaking of the past, did you know that the Royal Navy used to have a doctrine of always having more battleships than the world's second and third largest fleets put together? That's crazy, man. And they even had a Commander in Chief Atlantic Fleet, known as the C in C A-Fleet. I mean, who comes up with these names? "Sink-a-fleet"? That's just asking for trouble. But enough about war and ships and stuff. Let's talk about gold and silver. I mean, they're pretty cool, right? And oil too, although I guess that's not really an ore. It's more like a liquid that comes out of the ground. But did you hear about Scotland and their oil reserves? Apparently, they have trillions of pounds worth of oil reserves, and a lot of it belongs to Orkney and Shetland. That's crazy, man. I wonder what's going to happen with all that. And then there's the whole thing with uncontacted tribes. It's like, what do you even do with that? You don't want to make them seem weird or exotic or animalistic, but at the same time, they're so different from us. I remember hearing about this tribe on the Andaman Islands that was supposedly uncontacted, but when researchers finally managed to visit them, they found them sitting on the floor of one hut watching TV. I mean, what even is that? And then there's Afghanistan. I don't know the first thing about it, but apparently, it's full of terrorists. At least, that's what some people say. Speaking as a mother, I just want everyone to be safe, you know? But let's talk about something more fun, like rugby. I'm Scottish, so of course, I support Scotland. We may not be the best team out there, but we play fun rugby, mostly. I remember watching them back in '91, playing pretty poor sloggy rugby based around Gavin's boot. But then in '94, they started playing exciting mercurial fast rucking rugby based around Rob Wainwright and Gregor Townsend's eclectic talents. And then there was a really grim decade and a bit, but in the last four years, they've been really fun to watch. Attacking lines, sense of adventure, Stuart Hogg, and nowadays Seymor and Bennet. Of course, we've never actually won anything or been that internationally competitive, but that's part of our charm, you know? We're the romantic, perpetually unlucky, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory time and again, glorious losers. And then there's England. They've been utterly unwatchably dreary and tedious from 1991 until about 2013, and then again from the point they took Burgess off in the Wales game until today. If they find an openside flanker and allow Joseph and Watson more of the ball, then there's a chance they might become watchable again. But the way they played against Italy doesn't suggest a return to watchability any time soon. Scoring tries doesn't automatically make you exciting if you score tries in the manner of an accountant. Failing to score tries doesn't automatically make you boring if you fail to score tries in the manner of a flaming runaway train packed with explosives. But enough about rugby. Let's talk about T20. It's like penalty shootouts in football, you know? It's exciting, but it's not really the same as the real thing. Test cricket is like chess, man. It's all about strategy and depth. T20 is more like noughts and crosses. Sure, it's fun, but it's not the same. And then there's rugby league. The NZ team is All Black in both Union and League, but the Union team is more famous. League has more action, but it's very stop/start, and so I don't think it has the same depth of strategy as Union. Union is also a global sport, whereas League only really took off in Northern England and Australia (although the NZ team is very good). It comes down to personal preference, but for me, the constant stopping and starting of league is a real turn off. Union is ace. And finally, let's talk about Elbert. I was wondering if it was hard to get to or something, but apparently, if you time it right, you can play well with a high backlift. Just ask Brian Lara. And did you know that he has a really strong and fairly pleasant Irish accent? That ra ra posh English voice was just him doing a voice for TV. Maybe that's what makes it a thing you wouldn't believe. Anyway, that's enough rambling for now. If you want to learn more about rugby, head over to /r/rugbyunion. And if you want to learn more about anything else, well, I don't really know what to tell you. Just keep reading, I guess.
