Sorry, I just really didn't know how to explain it to find the name. Have you thought about online dating? You might be more relaxed on the internet. Your first hurdle here isn't your virginity or baldness, it's your self-esteem. Sounds corny, but it's true. It's important to remember that everyone has insecurities, and it's okay to have them. But it's also important to work on them and not let them hold you back from experiencing life and love. When it comes to online dating, it can be a great way to meet new people and potentially find a romantic partner. It allows you to connect with others from the comfort of your own home, which can be less intimidating than meeting someone in person. Plus, you can take your time getting to know someone before deciding to meet up in real life. But it's important to approach online dating with a healthy mindset. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to find someone right away, and don't get discouraged if you don't have immediate success. It can take time to find the right person, and that's okay. In terms of your virginity and baldness, remember that these are just physical attributes and don't define who you are as a person. It's important to focus on your positive qualities and what makes you unique. Confidence is attractive, so work on building up your self-esteem and embracing who you are. Now, onto the topic of blowjobs. It sounds like you're feeling a bit insecure about your ability to please your partner in this way. First of all, it's important to remember that everyone has different preferences when it comes to sexual acts. Just because your partner may not enjoy blowjobs as much as you thought they would doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong. Communication is key in any sexual relationship. Talk to your partner about what they do and don't enjoy, and ask for feedback on what you can do to improve. It's also important to remember that sex is a two-way street, and both partners should be focused on pleasing each other. If your partner is complaining about your performance, it's important to address the issue and work on finding a solution together. But if they're just not into blowjobs, that's okay too. There are plenty of other ways to please each other sexually. As for the idea of a threesome with your wife and her friend, it's important to approach this with caution. Threesomes can be a fun and exciting experience, but they can also be complicated and potentially damaging to a relationship if not handled properly. Before agreeing to anything, make sure you and your wife have a clear understanding of what you both want and what your boundaries are. It's also important to make sure the friend is on board and comfortable with the idea. Remember that consent is key in any sexual situation, and all parties involved should feel comfortable and respected. If you're not sure if a threesome is right for you, take some time to think about it and discuss it with your partner before making any decisions. In terms of your attraction to men, it's important to remember that sexuality is fluid and can change over time. It's okay to explore your feelings and figure out what you're attracted to. But it's also important to be honest with yourself and your partner about your desires. If you're feeling stuck in your own little world and struggling with self-esteem issues, it may be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor. They can help you work through your feelings and develop a healthier mindset. Overall, it's important to remember that everyone has their own insecurities and struggles. But with a little self-reflection and communication, you can work through these issues and find happiness and fulfillment in your relationships and in life.
