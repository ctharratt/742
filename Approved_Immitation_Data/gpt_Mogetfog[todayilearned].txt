Oh man, immortality. It's a concept that has fascinated humans for centuries. The idea of living forever, never aging, never dying. It's like the ultimate power trip, right? But is it really all it's cracked up to be? Let's say you could achieve immortality. You could live for an infinite number of years. That's a long time, my friend. And sure, at first it might seem like the coolest thing ever. You could see the world change and evolve over time. You could witness history being made. You could even mess with future archaeologists by leaving behind weird structures and items. But eventually, wouldn't it get old? I mean, think about it. You would have an infinite amount of time to get bored. And what happens when you get tired of life? When you've seen and done everything there is to see and do? Then what? Sure, you could spend eons contemplating how to end your life. But would that really be satisfying? To spend an eternity just waiting to die? And what if you couldn't die? What if you were stuck in an eternal existence, unable to escape it? That sounds like a nightmare to me. And let's not forget about the whole copying your consciousness thing. Sure, it might seem like a way to achieve immortality, but is it really you? Your consciousness still resides in your body, no matter how much you try to think like the copy or feel what the copy is feeling. It's like creating a whole new consensus that is exactly like you, but not you. It's just a memory file of you copied from your brain. Technically, it would not be you, just a copy. And why would someone want to achieve this type of immortality anyway? It's not like you would actually be living forever. You would just be a file, a memory, a copy of what you once were. But then again, maybe I'm just not seeing the appeal. Maybe there are people out there who would love to be immortal. To see the world change and evolve over time. To witness history being made. To mess with future archaeologists by leaving behind weird structures and items. And hey, if that's what you want, more power to you. But for me, I think I'll stick to my mortal existence. It might not be forever, but at least it's real. Now, let's talk about comics. Specifically, Marvel comics. If you're new to the world of comics, it can be pretty intimidating. There are so many characters, so many series, so many issues. Where do you even start? Well, my friend, I have some tips for you. First of all, pick a character you're interested in and start at the beginning of their most recent comic run. It's kind of like watching a TV show after it's been on for a few seasons. You don't know what the backstory is, and you don't know how they got there, but the story is entertaining and you'll start to pick up context clues about past events. Plus, every issue has a recap page telling you the story thus far and giving insight into any past events that affect the current story. And don't be afraid to jump around a bit. Marvel has run large story arcs that span the whole universe, not just one series. Every series will touch on it in some way, whether it's a major part of the story or just the character dealing with the local aftermath of the event. It's common for a series to hint at things going on in the universe, then suddenly jump to a whole new story involving many different characters for a few issues while the universe-wide arc plays out. These issues always clearly state they are part of the arc and give a short background on it. It can get kind of confusing if you aren't ready for it, but it's also a great way to see how all the different characters and series fit together in the Marvel universe. Some major arcs to look for are The Secret Wars, where every universe in the Marvel multiverse is dying; Axis, where a large group of heroes turn evil and a large group of villains turn good; Civil War, where heroes fight each other over a government requirement to register themselves after a major superhero-related tragedy (this is what the next Captain America movie is going to be based on); and Secret Invasion, where shape-shifting aliens named the Skrulls have invaded the world and are trying to take it over from the inside. And one final note: do not speak the name of that abomination of a movie. You know the one I'm talking about. We do not speak of it, for to speak its dreaded name means to summon its presence and usher in a new age of bad movie adaptations. Thankfully, the great messiah known as Days of Future Past sacrificed a part of itself in order to retcon the movie universe and make the happenings of that dreaded movie irrelevant. Deadpool will be the first canon movie that Wade Wilson appears in, and I for one am excited to see it. And now, let's talk about Chad and Edmund. These two are an unlikely pair, but together they form a dynamic duo that gets into all sorts of wacky scenarios. Chad is the goofy American fish out of water, while Edmund is the stuffy British butler type. In the pilot episode, Chad ends up in England by some plot coincidence, like mixed up transfer papers or getting on the wrong plane. His boss is fed up with his shenanigans, but gives him one last chance to redeem himself. And that chance is in England. Cue the studio audience laughter. Chad and Edmund have to figure out where someone's father is, and Chad comes up with a brilliant plan: he'll give the person a visa form and on it, one of the questions will be "where does your father live?" Edmund thinks it's a terrible idea, but Chad is convinced it will work. And you know what? It does. Cue more studio audience laughter. But then things take a turn for the worse when Chad tries to trick someone into thinking he can be trusted by wearing a turban and beard. Edmund is not amused. And that's just the pilot episode. Imagine all the wacky scenarios these two could get into over the course of a whole series. It's like a sitcom involving a quirky CIA agent living in England with his very dry-humored British intelligence partner. I would watch the heck out of that show. In conclusion, immortality might seem like the ultimate power trip, but is it really all it's cracked up to be? And if you're new to comics, don't be intimidated. Pick a character you're interested in and start at the beginning of their most recent comic run. And for the love of all that is holy, do not speak the name of that abomination of a movie.
