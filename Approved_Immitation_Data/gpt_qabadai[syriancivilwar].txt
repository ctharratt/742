Jordan has been a reliable ally of the West in the Middle East, but it is facing a growing problem of young men joining extremist groups such as ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front in neighbouring Syria and Iraq. The country has become a major source of foreign fighters, ranking third after Saudi Arabia and Tunisia. Jordanian authorities and researchers on radical Islamists estimate that between 1,500 and 2,000 Jordanians have joined these groups in recent years, giving the tiny monarchy an outsize representation. The country has recently intensified its clampdown on perceived sources of extremism, but some Jordanians are rankled by the monarchy’s friendly ties with neighbour Israel and its harsh treatment of homegrown Islamists. Concern is also growing over efforts to marginalise the main political opposition—the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood—and critics say the government’s counterterrorism policies are actually stoking the extremism they intend to curb. The transformation of Mohammad Dalaeen from a promising medical student to an ISIS fighter underscores the challenges for the pro-Western Jordanian monarchy in stopping young men from crossing the borders to join extremist groups in neighbouring Syria and Iraq. In January, Dalaeen joined his parliamentarian father in a protest against ISIS after the militants captured a childhood acquaintance who became a Jordanian fighter pilot. Nine months later, the 23-year-old carried out a suicide bombing for the extremist group. Dalaeen was the second son of a parliamentarian to die as a member of either ISIS or the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front in Syria this year. “ISIS has turned into a role model, one that has become appealing for educated people, for doctors, for sons of MPs,” said Hassan Abu Hanieh, an independent researcher and expert on Islamist groups. Jordan is the birthplace of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Sunni extremist who founded al Qaeda in Iraq—the precursor to ISIS. Young Jordanian men have become reliable recruits for extremist groups owing to the small country’s proximity to the battlefields. High poverty rates and constraints on political expression have also compelled some to leave, according to Abu Hanieh. But Dalaeen’s case shows that even those who are well-off and whose families are part of the political establishment can be drawn to violence. Jordanian government officials have said the weakening of the Muslim Brotherhood was a result of splits within the group. They defended their measures, saying they were governed by the rule of law. In the past year, Jordanian security authorities have amended and moved to aggressively enforce a sweeping antiterrorism law adopted in June 2014. Criticism of Jordan’s regional and international allies has become an offence punishable under that law, as is use of social media deemed inappropriate. Human Rights Watch says the amended law severely restricts free speech and exposes peaceful critics of the government to prosecution in the name of fighting terrorism. According to Dalaeen’s father, his son’s interest in ISIS appears to have resulted from relationships he cultivated while studying in Ukraine. In Ukraine, the young man married and from there began mingling with neighbours from Chechnya, Azerbaijan and Tunisia, his father said. On visits home to Jordan, the family would debate whether ISIS was a terrorist organisation and the role of Jordan in fighting the group—particularly after the militants burned captured Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kassasbeh alive while he was locked in a cage and jarred the nation. After the young pilot was killed, his childhood acquaintance Dalaeen appeared repulsed by ISIS, his father said. “There must be something wrong with them,” he recalled his son saying. The elder Dalaeen sent his son back to Ukraine to continue his studies. But when he returned for a visit in June, the father said he recoiled at his son’s long beard and unkempt hair. “I told him: ‘You don’t look like a student. You look like a monster.’ ” The two men spoke on a bench in a garden, where Dalaeen made his intentions explicit. He wanted to become a martyr and go to heaven, his father said. Dalaeen then cut off communication with his father, speaking only to his mother and a brother in brief Facebook messages. “His father is an infidel because he is in parliament drafting laws against God’s law,” his father said, recalling what his son had told the brother weeks before the son died. The last time the family heard from him was in August, when the son boasted that he had joined ISIS in their Iraqi stronghold of Mosul “living and sleeping comfortably.” They said the next time they heard about their son was when an ISIS-linked television channel showed a picture of Dalaeen. Under his smiling face was the nom de guerre “Abu Baraa, the Jordanian.” The medical student was one of three suicide bombers who drove explosive-rigged cars into an Iraqi army barracks in the city of Ramadi, according to a claim of responsibility by ISIS. Jordan has recently intensified its clampdown on perceived sources of extremism. Over the past year, the government has barred preachers who delivered fiery sermons that incite against other religions or promote an austere Islamic ideology. It has also made building new mosques more difficult to prevent unlicensed preachers from developing small but dedicated followings outside of state control. The government estimated 500 of the Jordanian foreign fighters had been killed while another 500 have returned. Since June 2014 when Jordan amended its anti-terrorism law until August this year, the government said 150 people were facing charges of attempting to join militant groups, recruiting for armed groups or promoting extremist ideology. But some Jordanians are rankled by the monarchy’s friendly ties with neighbour Israel and its harsh treatment of homegrown Islamists. Concern is also growing over efforts to marginalise the main political opposition—the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood—and critics say the government’s counterterrorism policies are actually stoking the extremism they intend to curb.
