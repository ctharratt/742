You haven't said anything. You haven't rebutted anything I've said. All you've done is provide a vague description of your support for capitalism and the current system of private property ownership. But let's be clear, this system only works for those who hold the power and wealth. The average person has no means to survive without state intervention or charity. And even then, they are at the mercy of those who hold the power. You claim that suppressing private property ownership would require violence, but what about the violence required to maintain absentee ownership? The police and military exist to protect the interests of those who hold the power and wealth. And let's not forget that businesses themselves are "States" who impose violence with compliant agreement of those who carry it out (police and military), who are animated for the purpose of protecting property from those who created it. These organizations are totalitarian "States", with top-down power structures with no democracy. Anarchism, on the other hand, is simply organization over production and distribution by those who produce. It includes democratic control over the economy, not totalitarian control. Being paid a wage is, apparently, "wage slavery," and owning property is "theft of labor." The capitalist is a useless factor of production as its only role is as an intermediary. All commodities are labor power or products of labor power. Hence labor creates all wealth. No laborer would voluntarily exchange his power unless he received the full value of his labor. What makes him do so? The need to survive. The capitalist hires a worker only if they are able to increase their wealth from the arrangement. The increase comes from the application of labor power. In order to profit, the capitalist must pay less than the value of goods they produce. What about the other factors of production, you say? They are all products of previously applied labor power. The workers built the factory, they built the cars, they mined the ore, they built the machines to extract the ore, they created the electricity. The only reason capital is needed is because of the property regime imposed by violence, currently carried out by the nation-state. When the typical person rents themselves to an employer, they are not in control of their own labor process, but are made into a cog of a profit-making machine. Their movements, process, and time are controlled by the employer. If they fail to follow orders, they must find another employer or starve. This is not freedom, this is wage slavery. You claim that production can exist outside the realm of private property (i.e. Capital), but production cannot exist without labor. This makes the capitalist a useless factor of production as its only role is as an intermediary. All commodities are labor power or products of labor power. Hence labor creates all wealth. No laborer would voluntarily exchange his power unless he received the full value of his labor. What makes him do so? The need to survive. You ask how anarchists engage in wholesale violence and what opinions did I misrepresent? The truth is, anarchists do not engage in wholesale violence. Anarchism is about organizing production and distribution by those who produce. It includes democratic control over the economy, not totalitarian control. As for the opinions you misrepresent, you claim that being paid a wage or salary for a task is not slavery. But the truth is, wage slavery is a real thing. When a person is forced to rent themselves to an employer in order to survive, they are not free. They are slaves to the system. You claim that capitalism is necessary for production to increase, but this is simply not true. Capitalism accumulates through theft of value from labor. And what about the externalities of the market? How did the government keep the working day at 16 hours? What specifically? Protectionism kept us from following our competitive advantage, fur production. Every industrial nation today developed from import substitution. Name one that didn't. You ask what will restrict capitalists from paying people as little as possible and hiring scabs to evade unions. The answer is simple: democratic control over the economy. When workers have a say in how production and distribution are organized, they can ensure that their rights are protected. And as for ramping up production to include the unemployed without effective demand, the answer is again simple: democratic control over the economy. When workers have a say in how production and distribution are organized, they can ensure that everyone's needs are met. You claim that capitalists make more profit when information is not free, but the truth is, free information is essential for a functioning democracy. And as for giving back all wealth to workers who created it and had it stolen from them, the answer is again simple: democratic control over the economy. When workers have a say in how production and distribution are organized, they can ensure that everyone's needs are met. In conclusion, the current system of private property ownership and capitalism only works for those who hold the power and wealth. The average person has no means to survive without state intervention or charity. Anarchism, on the other hand, is about organizing production and distribution by those who produce. It includes democratic control over the economy, not totalitarian control. When workers have a say in how production and distribution are organized, they can ensure that everyone's needs are met. It's time to abolish the current system and extend effective control over production to the workers.
