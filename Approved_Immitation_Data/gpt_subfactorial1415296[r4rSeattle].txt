I don't know why I'm doing this. Pouring my heart out to strangers on the internet. Maybe it's because I'm so damn lonely. I've been alone for so long, I don't even remember what it feels like to have someone care about me. To have someone hold me when I'm sad, or tired, or just need a hug. It's like I'm living in a desert, with no water, no company, and no hope. And it's all because I'm not a girl. If I were a girl, people would care. They would sympathize with me. But because I'm a guy, I'm just a disgusting cockroach, a creature to be ignored and forgotten. It's not fair. It's not right. But that's the way it is. I want someone to care about me. Someone to love me. Even if I don't know her, even if she's just a stranger on the internet, if she gives me the slightest hope of change, I would be in love with her. I know it sounds crazy, but that's how desperate I am. I've tried everything. I've posted on every dating site, every forum, every subreddit. But it's always the same. Silence. Spam. Rejection. It's like I'm invisible. Like I don't even exist. And it hurts. It hurts so much. I know it's not reasonable for a girl to meet a random stranger off the internet. But what choice do I have? I'm so lonely, so desperate, that I'm willing to take any chance, any risk, just to feel something, anything. And it's not just the loneliness. It's the hypocrisy of it all. If you're a girl feeling lonely, people sympathize with you. They want to take care of you. But if you're a guy feeling lonely, you're just a loser, a creep, a pervert. It's not fair. It's not right. But that's the way it is. I know I sound bitter. I know I sound angry. But can you blame me? I've been living alone for over two years, without a single person I can relate to. Without a single person who cares. And it's all because I'm not a girl. I see happy couples everywhere. In movies, on TV, on the street. And it just makes me feel even more alone. Even more hopeless. Because I know I'll never have that. I'll never have someone to share my life with. Someone to love me for who I am. I know I sound pathetic. I know I sound like a whiny little baby. But can you blame me? Can you blame me for wanting what everyone else has? For wanting to be loved, to be cared for, to be held? I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know where to turn. I'm so lost, so alone, that I don't even know if I can go on. But I have to. I have to keep trying. I have to keep hoping. Because if I don't, then what's the point? What's the point of living if you're just going to be alone forever? I don't know if anyone will read this. I don't know if anyone will care. But I had to write it. I had to get it off my chest. Because if I don't, then I'll just keep rotting away, alone and forgotten, like a fish in a desert.
