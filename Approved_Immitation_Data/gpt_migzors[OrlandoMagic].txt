To all the Magic fans out there, it's time to face the truth. We are not a playoff team. It's painful to admit, but it's the reality of the situation. We have some talented players, but we lack consistency and the ability to defend the three-point line. It seems like every game, there is one player on the opposing team who just can't miss from beyond the arc. And it's not just one game, it's happening quite often. We also struggle to defend the three ourselves, which is a major problem in today's NBA. Let's take a look at some of the teams that we simply cannot beat: Golden State (obviously), San Antonio, and Cleveland. These are the top teams in the league, and we just don't have what it takes to compete with them. I hate to say it, but we're going to lose. Look at the way we've played in the last few games. We can't hit a three-pointer to save our lives. Does that mean we'll lose every game? No, not necessarily. But it does mean that we will not be competitive against the teams that we need to beat to get into the playoffs. I fear a massacre on Friday. Unless we start hitting our threes, which we should be able to do with players like Fournier, Frye, and Oladipo (and to a lesser extent, Hezonja), we're in trouble. So yes, it's incredibly important for us to win. But do the last few games give you confidence that we can do it? Probably not. I know some of you may be in denial, but it's time to face the facts. We need to make some changes if we want to be a playoff team. We need to improve our three-point shooting and our defense. We need to find a way to beat the top teams in the league. Now, let's talk about the recent game against the Rockets. It was a tough loss, but there were some positives to take away from it. Harkless played well, cutting down the baseline multiple times and getting some easy dunks. He was also aggressive on defense and had multiple steals in a short span of time. Elf also had a great game, nabbing his first triple-double. It's always exciting to see a player achieve a milestone like that. But there were also some negatives. We struggled to defend the three-point line once again, and we made some questionable coaching decisions. Why did Borrego sit Tobes and Hark in the fourth quarter? Were they fatigued or injured? It's hard to say, but it was a baffling move. Other teams don't seem to have this problem. They stick with a solid starting five and bring players back in as soon as they're ready to go. They don't sit them at the end of a close game for no reason. We need to figure out our rotation and stick with it. We can't afford to make these kinds of mistakes if we want to be a playoff team. Now, let's talk about the upcoming draft. There's been a lot of talk about Stanley Johnson and whether or not we should draft him. Some people think that he's the best player available and that we should take him, while others think that we should focus on filling our other needs. Personally, I'm not sure what to think. I'm the type of person who will lean towards one side if someone presents a good argument, but then I'll lean towards the other side if someone else presents a strong case. It's hard to say who the better talent is, especially when it comes to college players. But if SJ shows as much talent and ability as Tobias, then I hope we do draft him. He's young, talented, and has time to grow with the rest of our young franchise. But we need to be careful. We don't want to draft him just because he's the best player available. We need to make sure that he fits our team and our needs. Speaking of needs, we need to figure out what those are. We have some talented players, but we also have some glaring weaknesses. We need to improve our three-point shooting and our defense, and we need to establish a solid starting five. This off-season will be crucial for us. We need to make some smart moves and improve our team if we want to be a playoff team next year. In conclusion, it's time for us to face the truth. We are not a playoff team. We have some talented players, but we lack consistency and the ability to defend the three-point line. We need to make some changes if we want to be competitive with the top teams in the league. But there's still hope. We have some exciting young players, and we have the potential to turn things around. We just need to make some smart moves and improve our team. So let's stay positive and keep supporting our Magic. We may not be a playoff team this year, but we can still make progress and build towards a brighter future.
