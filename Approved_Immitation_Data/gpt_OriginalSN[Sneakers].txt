Yo, what's good sneakerheads? I see you got yourself some Yeezys. Nice pickup, but let's be real, they ain't classics. They may be head turners right now, but in 10 years, who knows if anyone will even remember Kanye West. I mean, the dude got famous through Jay Z, who is a classic artist. And let's not forget, most people never even heard of Don C before his Blues Clues 2s came out.  Drake? Yeah, he's hot right now, but in 10 years, he'll be pushing 40 and probably irrelevant. The term classics is reserved for the real OGs like Air Force 1s, 6in Timbs, OG colorway Jordans, converse, adidas all star, nike cortez, Air Max, and so on. Those are the shoes that have stood the test of time and will continue to do so.  Now, don't get me wrong, wear your heat when it's popular. But let's not pretend like Yeezys are on the same level as the classics. It's all hype, an artificially created beef between two corporations to drive sales. And if anything, it might cause unnecessary animosity between Jordan and Yeezy fans, which is just stupid and irrelevant.  I know some of the biggest Yeezy fans who followed him since his Beanie Siegel days (pre-Jay Z) and even they are appalled by his sneakers. Sales numbers don't even matter because mostly resellers with bots are buying up Jays and Yeezys, not their real fans. So, sales figures aren't indications of popularity among the two brands or people.  If you're a true sneakerhead, you buy Jordans for what they represent. The 6 championships, 10 scoring titles, 5-time MVP, 10-time first team offense, 9-time first team defense, GOAT. That's what makes Jordans classics. We're not comparing 2pac/Biggie Hail Mary 1s or Juicy 350s to Space Jam 11s. It's not even in the same genre (basketball vs hiphop?).  So, let's not get caught up in the hype and remember what really makes a shoe a classic. It's not just about the brand or the celebrity behind it. It's about the history and the impact it has had on the culture.  And let's not forget, wear your shoes however you want. But if you're going to talk about them, at least know what you're talking about. Don't be easing yourself with no lube, ya feel me?  In conclusion, Yeezys may be hot right now, but they ain't classics. Stick to the OGs if you want to be a true sneakerhead. And let's not get caught up in the beef between Jordan and Yeezy fans. It's all just hype and irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. So, wear your heat when it's popular, but don't forget about the classics that have stood the test of time.
