It's funny how people always say that blood is thicker than water, but in reality, it's not always the case. Sometimes, the people who are supposed to love and support you the most are the ones who hurt you the most. And when you try to open up to them and tell them how they've hurt you, they turn it around on you and make you feel like you're the problem. I know this all too well because I've been there. I've had to deal with toxic family members who have hurt me in ways that I never thought possible. And when I tried to confront them about it, they made me feel like I was the one who was causing all the problems. It's taken me a long time to realize that sometimes, you just have to cut people out of your life. It's not easy, but it's necessary for your own well-being. You can't keep holding onto toxic relationships just because they're family. You have to do what's best for you. For me, it was cutting off contact with my mother. She was always emotionally abusive and manipulative, and it took me a long time to realize that I didn't have to put up with it anymore. I remember the first time I stood up to her and told her that I wasn't going to take her abuse anymore. She called me a bitch and told me that I was the problem. But I knew deep down that I wasn't the problem. She was. It's been years since I've spoken to her, and I don't regret it one bit. I've been able to move on with my life and focus on the relationships that matter. I've built a family of my own with people who love and support me unconditionally. And I know that I'm better off without her toxic presence in my life. But cutting people out of your life isn't always easy. Sometimes, it means cutting off other family members too. I had to cut off my aunt and uncle because they were enablers of my mother's behavior. They would always take her side and make excuses for her, even when she was clearly in the wrong. It was hard to let them go, but I knew that I couldn't have them in my life if they were going to continue to support my mother's toxic behavior. It's not just about cutting people off, though. It's also about learning how to let go of the past. When you've been hurt by someone, it's easy to hold onto that pain and let it consume you. But the truth is, holding onto that pain only hurts you in the long run. You have to learn how to let go and move on. For me, that meant burying the memories deep down and trying to forget about them. It's not healthy, I know, but it's the only way I've been able to cope. I don't think about the traumatic things that happened to me because it's too painful. But I know that they happened, and I know that they've shaped who I am today. It's not just about forgetting, though. It's also about forgiving. Forgiving the people who have hurt you is one of the hardest things you'll ever have to do, but it's also one of the most important. Forgiveness doesn't mean forgetting what happened or excusing their behavior. It means letting go of the anger and resentment and moving on with your life. I've forgiven my mother for what she's done to me, but that doesn't mean that I'll ever forget. It doesn't mean that I'll ever let her back into my life. But it does mean that I've been able to let go of the anger and resentment and move on with my life. At the end of the day, you have to do what's best for you. You have to surround yourself with people who love and support you unconditionally. You have to let go of the toxic relationships and the pain of the past. And you have to forgive, not for their sake, but for your own. It's not easy, but it's worth it. Trust me.
