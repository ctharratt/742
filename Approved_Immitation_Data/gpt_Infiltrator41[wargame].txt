I have a friend who is a bit of a sore loser when it comes to online games. He's German, so maybe that has something to do with it. He's a strategy genius, though, and could probably write a thesis on Civ 4. But he only plays games he knows he can win, and he won't play anything that involves war or combat. He's content to stick to the computer and avoid any real challenges. But if you've played any Arma or Wargame title co-operatively in the past 5 years, you've probably seen this video at least once. It's a hilarious take on the tactical genre, and it's a great example of how to have fun with a game without taking it too seriously. I got a kick out of watching it deploy to fire, and I'm sure you will too. When my friend and I play games together, he always insists on playing the same game over and over again. He's so good at it that he always wins, but it gets boring after a while. I've tried to get him to play other games, but he's always reluctant. He's afraid of losing, I think, and he doesn't want to risk his reputation as a strategy master. But I think that's a mistake. Playing games that challenge you is the only way to get better. If you only play games you know you can win, you'll never improve. You'll never learn new strategies or tactics, and you'll never be able to adapt to new situations. You'll be stuck in a rut, always playing the same game and always winning, but never really growing as a player. That's why I love games like Arma and Wargame. They're challenging, but they're also a lot of fun. You have to think on your feet, adapt to new situations, and work together with your team to achieve your objectives. It's not just about winning or losing, it's about the experience of playing the game and the satisfaction of working together to achieve a common goal. Of course, there are always going to be people who take games too seriously. They get angry when they lose, they blame their teammates for their mistakes, and they refuse to play with anyone who isn't as good as they are. But that's not what gaming is about. It's about having fun, making friends, and enjoying the experience of playing together. So if you're like my friend and you only play games you know you can win, I encourage you to try something new. Take a risk, try a new game, and see what happens. You might surprise yourself and discover a new favorite game. And even if you don't win, you'll still have a great time playing with your friends and learning new strategies and tactics. In the end, it's not about winning or losing. It's about the experience of playing the game and the friendships you make along the way. So don't be afraid to take a risk and try something new. You might just discover a whole new world of gaming that you never knew existed.
