Well, let me just start by saying that I am not one to shy away from expressing my opinions, especially when it comes to the world of competitive gaming. And let me tell you, I have seen some things that have really rubbed me the wrong way. For starters, there is this whole issue of publicly announcing mistakes and then making smart ass comments about it. I mean, come on, is that really necessary? It just makes you look like a total jerk. And don't even get me started on people who ask for more sign-ups right after making a snarky remark. That's just hypocritical. And then there are the people who make a big deal out of nothing. I mean, sure, if someone makes a mistake, it's okay to point it out, but there's no need to make a big fuss about it. I remember this one time when someone told me about a mistake I made, but they didn't seem to care too much about it, so I didn't think it was a big deal. But then someone else went and publicly announced my mistake and made a smart ass comment about it. That was just plain dickish. But you know what really grinds my gears? When people don't take responsibility for their actions. I mean, if you have a problem with something, just come to me personally and we can talk it out. Don't just blow it off with an "ok." That's just disrespectful. Now, let's talk about the game itself. I've been playing for a while now, and I have to say, there's still so much I don't know. I mean, I didn't even realize they nerfed Pit that much. No wonder some of the stuff I've been trying to replicate from older videos has been so ridiculously hard. But you know what? I'm not giving up. I love Pit's play style, and I really want him to be my main. I've been watching videos and practicing as much as I can, and I can already see the improvement I've made. But I know there's still so much more to learn. In fact, my first competitive match ever was actually on stream, and let me tell you, it was pretty bad. But you know what? I'm not ashamed of it. I know I have a lot to learn, and I'm willing to put in the work to get better. And you know what else? I love my last name. It's unique and it sets me apart from everyone else. But you know what doesn't set me apart? Being a confrontational person. I don't like conflict, but I also don't like when people disrespect me or others. That's why I went up to someone after a tournament and told them that I didn't appreciate how they handled a situation. And you know what they did? They just blew it off with an "ok." That's not how you handle things. But you know what? I'm not going to let that get me down. I'm going to keep practicing and learning and improving. And who knows? Maybe one day I'll be the one making snarky comments and publicly announcing mistakes. But you know what? I'll do it with class and respect, because that's what this community deserves.
