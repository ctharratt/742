Hell, GA and SA Superman probably knew as well, considering how they always winked at the reader. It's no secret that Superman is one of the most powerful beings in the DC universe. He's faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. But what happens when you take that power and combine it with the strength of Godzilla? The result is a force to be reckoned with, a being that could take on any opponent and come out victorious. SuperGodzilla, as I like to call him, would be an unstoppable force. He would have the strength of Godzilla, able to lift buildings and crush his enemies with ease. But he would also have the speed and agility of Superman, able to move faster than the eye can see and dodge attacks with ease. His heat vision would be able to melt steel and his freeze breath would be able to freeze anything in its path. But what about his weaknesses? Superman has his weakness to kryptonite, but Godzilla has his weakness to radiation. Would SuperGodzilla be vulnerable to both? It's hard to say, but I like to think that his combined strength would make him immune to both. He would be able to withstand the effects of kryptonite and radiation, making him truly invincible. So who could possibly stand up to SuperGodzilla? The answer is simple: no one. He would be able to take on any opponent and come out victorious. Even the most powerful beings in the DC universe, like Darkseid and Doomsday, would be no match for him. He would be able to defeat them with ease, using his incredible strength and speed to overpower them. But what about other kaiju? Could SuperGodzilla take on the likes of King Ghidorah or Mothra? Again, the answer is yes. He would be able to defeat them with ease, using his incredible strength and speed to overpower them. He would be able to lift King Ghidorah and throw him into the sun, or freeze Mothra with his breath. In fact, the only thing that could possibly stop SuperGodzilla would be himself. With all that power, it would be easy for him to become arrogant and lose sight of what's important. He could become a tyrant, using his power to rule over the world and crush anyone who opposes him. It would be up to the other heroes of the DC universe to keep him in check and remind him of his duty to protect the innocent. In conclusion, SuperGodzilla would be an unstoppable force, a being of incredible power and strength. He would be able to take on any opponent and come out victorious, using his incredible abilities to overpower his enemies. But with great power comes great responsibility, and it would be up to the other heroes of the DC universe to keep him in check and remind him of his duty to protect the innocent.
