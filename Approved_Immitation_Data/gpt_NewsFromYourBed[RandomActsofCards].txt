Hey there! I have a bunch of cat birthday cards that I would love to send out to anyone who wants one! Just shoot me your address and I'll get one in the mail to you ASAP. I also have some other cards and postcards, including one of a street with a stoplight and some old cars on it. It looks like it's from the 70s or something, and it's just a shot down a street with a few old trucks and some little stores. If you're interested in that one, let me know and I'll send it your way. I'm guessing Rogers is a small town? That's the vibe I got from the postcard. It's kind of cool to see what things looked like back in the day, though. I wish I still had it so I could show you a picture, but I already sent it off. Oh well! If you're looking for something a little more personalized, I can definitely do that too. Just let me know the address and some of your favorite things, and I'll make sure to include them in the card. If you have any favorite animals, I have some pictures of those too that I can send along. Or, if you just want a photo that I'm really proud of, I can do that too! And if you're feeling really adventurous, I can even make you a bracelet to go along with the card. Just let me know what colors you like and I'll whip something up for you. Or, if you're not into bracelets, that's totally fine too. I'm happy to just send a card. If you're not sure what to do with a blank card, don't worry! There are no rules. Just fold some paper in half and do whatever you want. Draw, write, put on stickers, whatever! It's your card, so make it your own. I love this idea of sending cards and postcards to people. It's such a simple way to brighten someone's day and let them know that you're thinking of them. If you want a card or postcard from me, just PM me your address and I'll get one in the mail to you as soon as I can. And if you're looking for something specific, let me know! I have a lot of different interests, so I might have something that you'll like. I'm a big fan of Calvin and Hobbes, Snoopy, cats, Disney, music, and books, so if any of those things interest you, let me know and I'll see what I can do. I also have some cards that my mom made that are really cute. They all have animals on them, so if you're looking for something like that, just let me know and I'll send one your way. I'm from Texas, so if you're looking for a postcard or card from here, I can definitely help you out. I have a few different ones to choose from, so just let me know what you're interested in. And if you're looking for something to send to a friend or loved one, I can definitely help you out with that too. Just let me know their favorite colors and I'll make sure to include them in the card. My favorite book is Alice in Wonderland because I love Alice. She just has such funny and quirky thought processes, and her personality always makes me chuckle out loud while reading the book. Really, all the characters are quite funny and odd, which is part of what makes the book so great. If you're looking for a good quote from the book, let me know and I'll see what I can find. And if you're interested in getting a card or postcard from me, just PM me your address and favorite colors and I'll get one in the mail to you as soon as I can. I recently sent out a Texas postcard to someone, so if you're looking for one of those, let me know and I'll see if I have any left. And if you're looking for something a little more nature-y, I have a postcard like that too that I can send your way. Polar bears are my favorite animals, so if you have a postcard or card with one on it, I would love to claim it! And if you're curious, if I could be any animal, I would probably want to be an otter. They just look so playful and fun, and I love swimming, so it seems like a good fit. Anyway, if you're interested in getting a card or postcard from me, just PM me your address and let me know what you're interested in. I'm always happy to send something out to brighten someone's day!
