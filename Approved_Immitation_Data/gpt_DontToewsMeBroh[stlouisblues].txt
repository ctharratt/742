Alright, let's talk about Pietrangelo. I know some of you are big fans of him, but let's be real here, he's not the elite defenseman that some of you make him out to be. Sure, he's the captain of the team and gets a lot of ice time, but that doesn't automatically make him a top-tier player. First of all, let's talk about his offensive production. It's not great. In fact, there are 32 other defensemen in the league who have more points than him, and 30 of them have played less minutes. That's not exactly the mark of an elite player. And don't even get me started on his plus-minus. It's the lowest on the team, aside from Scott Gomez. That's not exactly a great stat to have if you're supposed to be a defensive defenseman. Now, I know some of you are going to argue that plus-minus isn't a great stat to judge players across different teams, but it's a good stat to judge players on the same team by. And when you look at the other defensemen on the Blues, Pietrangelo is clearly not performing as well as he should be. And let's not forget about his contract. He's making $6 million a year, which is a lot of money for a player who isn't producing as much as he should be. There are other "shut down defensemen" in the league who are making less money and performing better than Pietrangelo. Now, I know some of you are going to argue that he's a smart player and a good passer, but that's not enough to make him an elite defenseman. He can't hit, he can't shoot, and he has no creativity. Those are all important skills for a defenseman to have, and Pietrangelo just doesn't have them. And let's not forget about his performance in the playoffs. He's been a non-factor in the playoffs for the past few years, and that's not what you want from your captain and supposed "elite defenseman." If he can't step up in the playoffs, then what good is he? Now, I know some of you are going to argue that he's been hurt for half the season, but that's not an excuse. He's still playing, and he's still not producing as much as he should be. And even when he's healthy, he's not performing at an elite level. So, what's the solution? Well, I think the Blues should either trade him or try to renegotiate his contract. He's just not worth $6 million a year, and there are other defensemen out there who are performing better and making less money. And let's not forget about the All-Star game. Some of you are arguing that he deserves to be there, but I just don't see it. There are plenty of other defensemen in the league who are more deserving of an All-Star nod than Pietrangelo. Just look at the list of defensemen I provided earlier. They're all playing against the best lines on the opposing teams, and they're all producing more than Pietrangelo. In conclusion, Pietrangelo is just not the elite defenseman that some of you make him out to be. He's not producing as much as he should be, he's not performing well in the playoffs, and he's just not worth $6 million a year. The Blues should either trade him or try to renegotiate his contract, because he's just not living up to his potential.
