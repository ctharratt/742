When it comes to playing Payday 2, there are a lot of different builds and strategies that players can use to succeed. However, not all builds are created equal, and some are more effective than others. In this guide, we'll take a look at some of the best builds for different playstyles and difficulties, as well as some general tips for success. First, let's talk about the different playstyles that players can use in Payday 2. There are four main playstyles: loud, stealth, hybrid, and support. Loud builds are focused on dealing as much damage as possible and surviving in the face of overwhelming enemy fire. Stealth builds are focused on avoiding detection and completing objectives without alerting guards or triggering alarms. Hybrid builds are a mix of loud and stealth, allowing players to switch between the two as needed. Support builds are focused on providing assistance to the rest of the team, such as healing, reviving, or providing cover fire. For loud builds, the best option is usually a techforcer build with the Muscle perk deck. This build focuses on using heavy armor and powerful weapons to deal with enemies head-on. The key skill to have is Overkill, which allows shotguns to deal massive damage at close range. The best shotgun to use is the Locomotive 12G, which can deal huge amounts of damage with the right mods. Other important skills to have include Iron Man, which increases armor recovery rate, and Bulletproof, which increases armor durability. For weapons, players should use a high-damage assault rifle like the CAR-4 or AK, as well as a shotgun for close-range combat. For stealth builds, the best option is usually a mastermind/fugitive build with the Burglar perk deck. This build focuses on using silenced weapons and stealth skills to avoid detection and complete objectives. The key skill to have is ECM Specialist, which allows players to disable cameras and open doors silently. Other important skills to have include Shinobi, which increases movement speed and reduces detection risk, and Sixth Sense, which highlights enemies through walls. For weapons, players should use silenced pistols or SMGs, as well as a melee weapon for silent takedowns. For hybrid builds, the best option is usually a mastermind/technician build with the Rogue perk deck. This build focuses on using a mix of loud and stealth skills to complete objectives. The key skill to have is Inspire, which allows players to revive teammates from a distance and increase their movement speed. Other important skills to have include Silent Drilling, which allows players to drill silently, and Bulletproof, which increases armor durability. For weapons, players should use a high-damage assault rifle like the CAR-4 or AK, as well as a silenced pistol or SMG for stealth. For support builds, the best option is usually a mastermind/medic build with the Crew Chief perk deck. This build focuses on providing healing and support to the rest of the team. The key skill to have is Combat Medic, which allows players to revive teammates with more health and reduce their bleedout time. Other important skills to have include Inspire, which allows players to revive teammates from a distance and increase their movement speed, and Uppers, which allows players to throw health packs to teammates. For weapons, players should use a high-damage assault rifle like the CAR-4 or AK, as well as a shotgun or SMG for close-range combat. Now that we've covered the different playstyles and builds, let's talk about some general tips for success in Payday 2. First, it's important to always aim for the head. Headshots deal more damage and can take down enemies more quickly. Second, when getting tazed, try to find the tazer highlighting you and highlight him with the F key. This will make it easier for your teammates to take him down. Third, don't ignore snipers. They will shine their red laser at you, so follow the laser and take them out before they can do too much damage. Fourth, always have a deployable equipped, such as ammo bags, med bags, or trip mines. These can be a lifesaver in tough situations. Finally, don't be afraid to experiment with different builds and weapons. Payday 2 is a game that rewards creativity and experimentation, so try out different strategies and see what works best for you. In conclusion, Payday 2 is a game that offers a lot of different playstyles and builds for players to choose from. Whether you prefer loud, stealth, hybrid, or support, there is a build that will suit your playstyle. By following these tips and experimenting with different strategies, players can become successful heisters and take on even the toughest challenges.
