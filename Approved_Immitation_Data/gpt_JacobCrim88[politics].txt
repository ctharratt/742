So, I'm going to Dogfish brewery tomorrow and I'm pretty excited about it. I've read that at the end of the tour, you get a little four sampler, but two of them have to be the 90 Minute and something else that I do enjoy. So, the other two spots I have no idea, but I would love to try something I've never had before, like World Wide Stout or Bitches Brew. I've been looking forward to this for a while now, but of course, bum fuck North Carolina is not on that list. We can never have good things. I know what happened with socialism and communism in other countries, but I just do not believe that parts of either system injected into our system will cause for total decay. I might be paranoid about some things, but not socialism or communism. It's like saying all pizza sucks because of Pizza Hut. And I hear it's a great beer state. I need to visit. My dad and I went for lunch last week, and he was explaining to me how when he was growing up, they were all afraid of socialism and communism. And it boggles his mind how well a socialist like Bernie Sanders is doing. He couldn't comprehend that WE did not live through all that propaganda bullshit, so we have no reason to be afraid. After Romney, I thought they would do that, but it seems like they generally don't give a fuck about the youth vote. My girlfriend's old roommate made a good point about how it is smart of Hillary, in a political viewpoint, to change with polls. But it really makes it appear that Hillary has no beliefs of her own. What do you expect from a group of voters who grew up during the George W. Bush years? I would think mainly old people. And why is that a big deal in 2016? To paint him as some sort of sleeper cell communist? What is a "sister city"? I see this thrown up all the time as a negative against him. Why? Because I want to watch Trump have his guns focused on less candidates and thus be stronger. I just can't wait to watch a GOP debate with Trump and two other people on stage. I am more shocked that this show is still on air. I'm hoping one day he can return to form. If he even wants to. I've been saying this since the first debate. But hopefully the next time they face each other on stage, Bernie comes with the fire. What I cannot wrap my head around is how or why the DNC put all of their money on black with Clinton. There are a dozen other supremely qualified candidates who could have run this cycle. This is also what I do not understand. There was no one else that the DNC could get behind other than HRC, really? Because that makes sense. It is just another Republican conspiracy. /s I was at a concert recently, and the line for the ladies' restroom was about a mile long. The men's line was long too. When I finally got inside, still waiting, two ladies come out of one of the stalls and got a few laughs from the guys. One of them exclaimed, "Hey! When you gotta go, you gotta go!" No one was offended. I know I wouldn't. Last thing I want to see is a girl taking a shit. Uh, because he doesn't want to send future vets into useless wars? That GWB photo is nightmare-inducing. Why is that though? Why are boomers the worst? Because that's been the propaganda towards the party for decades. It hurts now. But watching her lose to Trump will be a gleeful experience. At this point, I'm not going to be surprised when he is president. This will be my third time voting (28 yo). I guess I don't understand Hillary's momentum since I cannot understand why anyone would vote for her. Which is why you can't trust her. Anderson was right to ask if she would say anything to get votes. Watching her crash and burn against Trump will be a glorious event. While he is throwing cash at her on the debate stage and she doesn't know whether to accept it or not. Which will make it that much sweeter if she is the nominee and loses. As a Bernie supporter, I do not understand why after three states, a lot of his supporters are freaking the fuck out. Sure, she'll have momentum, I guess. I guess because I don't see anyone jumping ship to her. It's a Marathon y'all. EDIT: plus each week her campaign shoots itself in the foot. I can't wait to hear the crickets from the smug Hillary supporters when Trump is our new president. That's the thing that boggles my mind. How could anyone with her track record be in contention for "best option"? And it is every election cycle, I wonder if that ever stops being a thing. Yet she refuses to hold herself to a higher standard than them. Because she is basically one of them. When compared to a bunch of religious extremists wanting to start a war over religious extremism who still believe in Reaganomics, yes. So no sane candidate. Guess I should have added that bit too. But at least he can reminisce about being poor. Can any of the other candidates do the same? I doubt it. I wonder if Hillary implodes if she loses again. I've waited for the two-party system to die for a while. Glad it might finally happen. He drove around in a rusted-out, Bondo-covered VW bug with no working windshield wipers. Friends said he was “always poor” and his “electricity was turned off a lot.” So he really is one of us. I swear some Republicans care more about Israel than their own country. Meanwhile, HRC is asking "what is the internet?" The selfie with the Kim/Kanye and now this. She is even out of touch with celebrities that people actually like. Every specialist clinic I've ever worked at, be it pain medicine or gastroenterology, had at least a three-month waiting period for new patient appointments. But it was more like six months. Like many have said, even if she wins the nomination, it's doubtful she beats Trump. Most of Bernie's supporters do not care about the Party. She just wants the title. The truth, like her views, changes through time. They're just upset he used the system in place, and now she isn't cake-walking to the nomination. It goes well! Hope the same for you. Flip her hair into their face. Oh geez. Some do. My best friend is gay, and he despises her and gets so upset when any LGBT folks support her. Anti-Trump = Anti-White. You are now blocked from r/conservative. We are all mixed accent people. He will just dangle some money from a fishing pole when debating her on stage. So her main attacks on Bernie are: Obama, Guns, and his ideas are too big. Ok. My dad will send me articles like this. Because socialism is the same everywhere, am I right? She wasn't for marriage equality until three years ago. And is still against marijuana legalization. I think most Bernie supporters hate Trump and Hillary equally. Five years ago, that would be a yes. SC also booed Ron Paul for quoting the Golden Rule for foreign policy. Trump will destroy her in a debate. I firmly believe that. And I understand that. But politics is a game.
