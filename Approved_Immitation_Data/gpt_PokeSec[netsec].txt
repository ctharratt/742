Bug bounties have become an increasingly popular way for companies to incentivize security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities in their systems. The idea is simple: offer a reward to anyone who can find and report a security flaw, and in return, the company gets to fix the issue before it can be exploited by malicious actors. It's a win-win situation, right? Well, not always. Recently, there has been some controversy surrounding bug bounties, particularly in the case of ING Bank. ING Bank is a Dutch multinational banking and financial services corporation that offers a bug bounty program to security researchers. The program promises to reward researchers who find and report vulnerabilities in ING's systems, with rewards ranging from €100 to €5,000. However, one security researcher who found a critical vulnerability in ING's mobile banking app was left disappointed when the bank refused to pay him the promised reward. The researcher, who goes by the name "Wouter" online, discovered a vulnerability that allowed an attacker to bypass the app's two-factor authentication and gain access to a user's account. Wouter reported the vulnerability to ING, but the bank refused to pay him the promised reward of €1,000, claiming that the vulnerability was not severe enough to warrant a reward. This incident has sparked a debate about the effectiveness of bug bounty programs and whether they are worth the time and effort for security researchers. Some argue that bug bounties are a valuable tool for companies to improve their security posture and incentivize researchers to find and report vulnerabilities. Others argue that bug bounties are often more trouble than they're worth, with companies failing to pay out rewards or failing to take reported vulnerabilities seriously. So, what's the truth? Are bug bounties a valuable tool for improving security, or are they just a way for companies to save money on security testing? The answer, as with most things in security, is "it depends." Bug bounties can be a valuable tool for companies that are serious about security and are willing to invest in it. By offering rewards to security researchers, companies can tap into a vast pool of talent and expertise that they might not otherwise have access to. This can help them identify vulnerabilities that they might have missed otherwise and improve their overall security posture. However, bug bounties are not a silver bullet. They require a significant investment of time and resources on the part of the company, both in terms of setting up the program and in terms of triaging and fixing reported vulnerabilities. Companies that are not willing to invest in security in other ways are unlikely to see much benefit from a bug bounty program. Additionally, bug bounties can be a double-edged sword. While they can incentivize researchers to find and report vulnerabilities, they can also incentivize researchers to focus on finding low-hanging fruit rather than more complex vulnerabilities. This can lead to a false sense of security, with companies believing that their systems are secure because no one has found any vulnerabilities through the bug bounty program, when in reality, more sophisticated attackers may be able to find vulnerabilities that the bug bounty hunters missed. Another issue with bug bounties is that they can create a perverse incentive for companies to downplay the severity of reported vulnerabilities in order to avoid paying out rewards. This is what happened in the case of ING Bank, where the company refused to pay out a reward for a critical vulnerability because they deemed it to be not severe enough. This kind of behavior can erode trust between security researchers and companies and discourage researchers from reporting vulnerabilities in the future. So, what can companies do to ensure that their bug bounty programs are effective and don't create unintended consequences? Here are a few suggestions: 1. Invest in security in other ways. Bug bounties should not be the only way that companies invest in security. Companies should also invest in secure development practices, regular security testing, and ongoing security training for their employees. 2. Take reported vulnerabilities seriously. Companies should have a clear process for triaging and fixing reported vulnerabilities, and they should take all reported vulnerabilities seriously, regardless of whether they were found through the bug bounty program or not. 3. Be transparent about rewards. Companies should be clear about the rewards that they offer for reported vulnerabilities and should honor those rewards when vulnerabilities are reported. 4. Foster a culture of security. Companies should foster a culture of security within their organizations, where security is seen as everyone's responsibility and not just the responsibility of the security team. In conclusion, bug bounties can be a valuable tool for companies that are serious about security and are willing to invest in it. However, they are not a silver bullet and require a significant investment of time and resources on the part of the company. Companies that are not willing to invest in security in other ways are unlikely to see much benefit from a bug bounty program. Additionally, bug bounties can create unintended consequences, such as incentivizing researchers to focus on low-hanging fruit and eroding trust between researchers and companies. To ensure that bug bounty programs are effective, companies should invest in security in other ways, take reported vulnerabilities seriously, be transparent about rewards, and foster a culture of security within their organizations.
