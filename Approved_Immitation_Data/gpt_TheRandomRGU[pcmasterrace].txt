Review embargoes have been a hot topic in the gaming industry for quite some time now. For those who are not familiar with the term, a review embargo is an agreement between a game publisher and the media outlets that they provide review copies to, which prevents the outlets from publishing their reviews until a certain date and time. This is done to ensure that all reviews are released at the same time, and to give the publisher some control over the narrative surrounding their game. However, many gamers and critics have criticized review embargoes as being anti-consumer. The argument is that by preventing reviews from being released until after the game is already available for purchase, publishers are essentially hiding any negative aspects of the game and trying to trick consumers into buying it before they know what they are getting into. While I can understand this argument, I don't necessarily agree with it. Review embargoes are a necessary evil in the gaming industry, and they serve an important purpose. For one thing, they help to prevent spoilers from leaking out before the game is released. This is especially important for story-driven games, where the narrative is a key part of the experience. If reviewers were allowed to publish their reviews before the game was released, there would be a risk of major plot points being revealed, which would ruin the experience for many players. Additionally, review embargoes give publishers some control over the narrative surrounding their game. This is important because the initial reception of a game can have a major impact on its sales. If a game is universally panned by critics, it is unlikely to sell well, regardless of how good it actually is. By controlling when reviews are released, publishers can ensure that the initial reception of their game is positive, which can help to boost sales. Of course, this does not mean that review embargoes are perfect. There have been cases where publishers have used them to hide major flaws in their games, or to prevent negative reviews from being published. This is obviously not acceptable, and it is important for media outlets to be transparent about any agreements they have with publishers. At the end of the day, review embargoes are a necessary part of the gaming industry. While they may be frustrating for some consumers, they serve an important purpose in preventing spoilers and giving publishers some control over the narrative surrounding their games. As long as they are used responsibly, there is no reason to believe that they are anti-consumer.
