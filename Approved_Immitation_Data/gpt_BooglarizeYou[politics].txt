Well, well, well. Another day, another shit show with the Republican party. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion. And don't even get me started on Wolf Blitzer. That guy couldn't intimidate a bowel of cold oatmeal. But let's talk about the real issue here: the poorly educated, fearful, and hateful protestants who want the world to come to an end so their zombie sky dictator will come back to life. These wackadoodle American protestants have a real hard on for the apocalypse, Jesus coming back, and all that BS. And enough with Israel already, for fuck's sake. Most of the Republican base doesn't even know what they're talking about. They just parrot whatever their leaders tell them to say. But let's move on to the Democratic caucus in Nevada. It's a real shit show over there too. Peggy Rhoades, the precinct chairwoman, had to break a tie by pulling a card from a deck. And representatives from the Clinton and Sanders campaigns asked her to shuffle the cards three times before spreading them out on a table. It's like watching a game of poker, but with the fate of the country at stake. And then there are the computer problems and long lines at some caucus sites. Some caucus-goers are even leaving because of the delays. It's a real mess. And let's not forget about the voter suppression going on. Michael and Diana Jones were turned away from participating in the caucus because they registered as "confidential voters." This means their names are not available as a public record to the Democratic Party, which runs the caucuses. Michael Jones said he talked to multiple volunteers and Democratic Party staff who were unfamiliar with the issue until he was finally turned away. It's like they don't even want people to vote. But let's move on to the real issue at hand: the candidates themselves. Ted Cruz is a real piece of work. He would push a crippled war orphan in front of a bus on Christmas morning if he thought it would help his political career. And that face of his? That's the face of a guy who didn't date a lot. And don't even get me started on Jeb! Bush. What his brother did is a fuck load worse than kicking an old lady out of her house. And Marco Rubio? He's like a broken record, repeating the same tired lines over and over again. And most of the Christians that support him are ignorant, vicious, abhorrent, and gluttonous lard asses that are fueled by hate and fear. Who, if it wasn't for Obamacare, would more than likely die much sooner than they will anyway from diabetes or heart disease. And then there's Hillary Clinton. She can't come by anything honestly. She can't succeed without Debbie Wasserman Schultz's shenanigans and a massive amount of partisan pampering from the press. If a candidate's own merits can't get them in the White House, then they damn well don't belong there. And let's not forget about her cringe-worthy moment in 2007 when she put on a black accent and said, "I don't feel no ways tired." It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion. But let's move on to the real issue at hand: the fundraisers. Hillary Clinton's campaign is holding fundraisers in Mexico, expanding its offshore money operation one day after the New Hampshire primary. One of the co-hosts of the fundraising dinner is Wal-Mart lobbyist Ivan Zapien, who relocated to Mexico with the company in 2015. Clinton served on the board of Wal-Mart from 1986-1992. And let's not forget about the breakfast fundraiser at the home of Alejandra Rangel Smith, an academic who has written about public health and housing in Mexico. Later this month, Clinton's daughter Chelsea and fashion editor Anna Wintour will headline a London fundraiser for the campaign. It's like they're not even trying to hide their corruption anymore. And let's not forget about Donald Trump. He's been known to embrace some shocking words for a presidential candidate, like when he repeated the words of a female supporter who yelled out during his rally in Manchester that Ted Cruz is a "pussy." And let's not forget about his sweat problem. Somebody sponged him off earlier. And let's not forget about his obsession with Reagan. Reagan was a moron. He's like Jesus for the GOP. And let's not forget about his obsession with the military. We have the largest military in the world by a mile light year. Our technology has improved since WWII. We don't need as many planes and ships, Marco. Shut down bridges. And let's not forget about the police. They are the most mistreated people in the US. What?? And let's not forget about the fear-mongering. From white Christians far more so than Muslims. What a crock. And let's not forget about the power grids. American and Canadian power grids are already connected, by the way. In conclusion, it's like watching a train wreck in slow motion. The Republican party is a mess, the Democratic caucus in Nevada is a mess, and the candidates themselves are a mess. And let's not forget about the fundraisers and the corruption. It's like they're not even trying to hide it anymore. But let's not lose hope. We can still make a difference. We can still fight for what's right. We can still make America great again. Or at least, we can try.
