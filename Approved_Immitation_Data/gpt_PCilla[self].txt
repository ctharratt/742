I've been thinking a lot lately about the concept of love and how it's portrayed in music. Specifically, I've been thinking about the song "Baby It's Cold Outside" and the controversy surrounding it. Some people argue that the song promotes rape culture, while others argue that it's just a harmless holiday tune. I decided to listen to the song with the "rape" concept in mind, just to see how it would make me feel. And I have to admit, it was kind of funny. But at the same time, it made me realize how easy it is to twist the meaning of a song to fit a certain narrative. The truth is, if you listen to any love song and apply a "rape" or "abusive relationship" concept or mindset to it, it can be "about rape." But that doesn't mean that's what the song is actually about. It's all about interpretation and perspective. I think it's important to be aware of the messages that are being conveyed in music and other forms of media. But at the same time, we can't jump to conclusions or make assumptions without fully understanding the context and intent behind the lyrics. On a lighter note, I've also been experimenting with my hair lately. I've tried out a few different colors, including bubble gum pink and lava red. But now I've settled on auburn, which I think suits me best. It was definitely a one-time thing, but I'm glad I tried it out just to see how I liked it. My grandma wasn't too thrilled about my hair experiments, but I told her to deal with it. She huffed and puffed a bit, but eventually she got over it. I think it's important to express ourselves and try new things, even if it's not what others expect or approve of. Speaking of trying new things, I've been having some interesting dreams lately. One dream involved being flown to school on a sea otter named Superman, while another dream involved Tom Cruise being my theatre professor. I can't really pinpoint any specific trend in my dreams, but they're always entertaining. In other news, a friend of mine recently went through a tough time with her family. She found out why her mom had left the family years ago, and it was a difficult situation to navigate. But in the end, her family was able to come back together and work through their issues. I'm glad things are looking up for her. On a personal note, I've been struggling with feeling like I'm not getting what I want or need in my relationship. I'm not the type of person who asks for things or expects things from others, but sometimes I can't help but wish that my partner would do something small and meaningful for me. It's a tricky situation because I don't want to come across as selfish or entitled. I know that love doesn't come from buying things for each other, but at the same time, it would be nice to feel appreciated and valued in that way. I think it's important to communicate our needs and desires in a relationship, but it can be difficult to do so without feeling vulnerable or needy. It's a delicate balance, and one that I'm still trying to figure out. In other news, there have been some unsettling events happening in my town. There were two murders with a robbery that occurred just a few miles from my home, and the whole community is shaken up. It's a reminder that we can never be too careful or too vigilant when it comes to our safety. On a lighter note, I've been going through some major changes in my academic life. I'm currently a college sophomore, and I've changed my major five times already. It's been a stressful and confusing journey, but I'm finally starting to feel like I'm on the right path. I think it's important to give ourselves permission to explore and experiment with different career paths and academic interests. It's okay to not know what we want to do with our lives right away. The important thing is to keep trying and keep learning. In conclusion, life is full of ups and downs, twists and turns. We never know what's going to happen next, but we can always choose how we respond to the challenges and opportunities that come our way. Whether it's experimenting with our hair, navigating complex relationships, or pursuing our academic and career goals, we can always find ways to grow and learn.
