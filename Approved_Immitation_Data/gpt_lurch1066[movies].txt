List of witch films by year? Yeah, I've seen a few of those. I remember watching The Craft back in the day, that was a classic. And of course, there's Hocus Pocus, can't forget about that one. But I'm not really into the whole witch thing, to be honest. I prefer my movies to be a bit more action-packed. Speaking of which, have you seen Mad Max? I just saw it last weekend and it was insane. I mean, the action scenes were just mind-blowing. And don't even get me started on Charlize Theron, she was a total badass in that movie. I heard they're already planning a sequel, which is great news because I can't wait to see what they come up with next. But let's talk about some other movies. Bruce Almighty, now that's a classic. I remember seeing that in the theater five times, I just couldn't get enough of it. And you know what's funny? I didn't even realize that Jennifer Aniston was in it until the second time I saw it. I mean, how did I miss that? But yeah, that movie is definitely in my top 20, maybe even my top 15. If I can find a decent torrent that's dubbed, I'll definitely download it and watch it again. Now, let's talk about some TV shows. Game of Thrones, everyone's talking about it, but I just can't get into it. I mean, I've heard it's like Skyrim with boobs, which sounds great, but it's just not my thing. And Breaking Bad, I know it's supposed to be amazing, but I'm just not into the whole drug thing. I prefer my TV shows to be a bit more lighthearted, you know? Like Malcolm in the Middle, that was a great show. I've seen Bryan Cranston in a few other things, but nothing really compares to that show. And don't even get me started on Dexter. I tried to get into it, I really did, but I just couldn't. I mean, I like to watch TV shows in a day or a few days, not one episode a week. Plus, I don't even have a TV signal at home, so I rely on torrents and Netflix to watch stuff. And let me tell you, I've been burned before. I followed everyone and watched something that I didn't like, and it was a total waste of time. So now, I try to learn as little as possible about something before I watch it. I don't want the hype to build up and then be disappointed. And speaking of disappointment, let's talk about Avatar. I mean, everyone said it was the greatest thing ever, so I watched it, and it was terrible. The story had so many holes, and I didn't even like any of the characters. And don't even get me started on the length of the movie. It was like a really big demo of what they could do with effects, but the story was just bad. And the guy from the movie found an egg that somehow survived and it imprinted on him thinking it was his mom and it saved the day a lot. I mean, what was that all about? It was like the Men in Black cartoon, if you've ever seen that. But let's talk about something a bit more positive. Highlander, now that's a great movie. Sure, the effects aren't amazing, but the story is so good that it doesn't even matter. And that's what I look for in a movie, a good story. I don't care if I can see every fiber of hair on a person's head or clothes, as long as the story is good. And that's why I didn't like Avatar, the story was just bad. And let's not forget about Godzilla. I remember watching the cartoon TV show when I was a kid, and it was so bad. But the new movie was pretty good. I mean, I was expecting more screen time for Godzilla, but the other monsters were pretty cool too. And I remember the old Godzilla movies, where he had to fight a mechanical sort of Godzilla. That was pretty cool. I haven't seen any of the other ones, but I might download them and see if they're any good. So, in conclusion, I prefer my movies and TV shows to have a good story, rather than just amazing effects. And I don't like to follow the hype, I like to make my own decisions. And if I don't like something, I don't waste my time on it. Life's too short for bad movies and TV shows.
