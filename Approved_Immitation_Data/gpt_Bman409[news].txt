Well, let me tell you something about desire. James says that "desire gives birth to sin". Does that mean that every desire is sin, even if it isn't acted on? Perhaps it always does. I don't really know. The point I'm making, however, is this: there is nothing different between a homosexual sinful desire and a heterosexual sinful desire. Sin is sin. The church's response should be to welcome sinners and teach them of the redeeming power of Christ and that they can have victory over sin. If they choose to continue in sin, however, then the Bible explains the process where the church should try to help them and ultimately, if they don't want it, disassociate with them. Homosexuals, like all humans, are a creation of God and they deserve the same respect and honor, and not violence and rejection. We shouldn’t forget the way Christ responded to the sinful woman, according to the Gospels, which became his word. ‘He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.’” He's right. We are all sinners. Christ's command to the woman caught in adultery was "go and sin no more". That is what the church's message should be to those caught in a sinful lifestyle... Go and sin no more. But this idea of rejecting and spitting on them is not Christian. Christ loved sinners, but at the same time, he called them to give up sin. You cannot follow Christ and continue to willfully live in sin. Those who practice homosexuality are living in sin. Simply being attracted to a person of the same sex is not sin. Practicing homosexuality is. (Same thing goes with adultery.. it's not a sin to be attracted to a person who isn't your spouse.. it's a sin to act on it). You would think if they "caught him in the act" as the article states, they could have shot him in the head. The thing is, she is employed to teach the philosophy of the college. If she deviates from that, they have the right to fire her. It's like saying a guy who is paid to sell Ford cars has the right to write blogs about how Chevy is better. Of course, he does.. that's free speech.. but he doesn't have the right to be employed by his current employer. If she believes Allah and the Christian God are one and the same, that is her business.. but that's not the theology of her employer and she's not paid to teach that. It takes skill to work 16 hours without having to take a piss. Of course, both cars and firearms pale in comparison when compared to alcohol-related deaths. Taking a page from General George Washington, I stand corrected. Is one of them running for King? This conviction suggests to me that a person has a legal obligation to keep other people from hurting themselves. This is a dangerous precedent. So if I see a drunk woman in the street, I am legally obligated to bring her in to my home, by force if necessary? Planning your vacation based on where you can smoke legally. Sad. I'll give you props. You make a good point here. Thank you. I didn't really think about that. Thank you... So if you are locked in with the shooter in a lockdown... There's no way for you to escape unless someone opens the doors? What if the shooter kills the guy with the code and sets the joint on fire? Why are most of the key countries missing??? Where is the data on Iraqis, Saudi Arabians, Jordanians, Syrians, and Afghanis??? LOL.. it's like they left almost all of the key countries. I have no problem with Muslims from Indonesia.. or Turkey.. Really, you could restrict the ban to four countries: Saudis, Pakis, Afghans, and Syrians and you'd keep out 90% of the terrorists (or more). One thing I've always been curious about.. If you're in a building during a "lockdown", can you get out? What is a lie? An edited video? The entire internet is pretty much consumed with edited videos. Did they dub in words that weren't said?? It's a stretch to try to connect that with this madman shooting police and everyone else. Ironically, I believe all of the Planned Parenthood employees were uninjured, weren't they?? Cover to cover... TO COVER he found the secret part! So if a guy shoots a cop, does Reddit "owe the nation an apology"? I don't think so. Speech is protected. It is free. If I accuse Planned Parenthood, or the cops for that matter, of doing something unethical.. that is my opinion, and my right. That does not give you the right to shoot someone. The shooter bears the blame.. don't try to pin this on people exercising their right of free speech. Not surprising. Millennials have a very low opinion of the Constitution. Did you even read the article? The SCHOOL is the one that is giving the students that right. Of course, Reddit downvotes me for pointing out the law... WHATEVER! Smith organizers said journalists were welcome to cover the event if they agreed to explicitly state they supported the movement in their articles. Stacey Schmeidel, Smith College director of media relations, said the college supports the activists' ban on media. "It's a student event, and we respect their right to do that, although it poses problems for the traditional media," Stacey Schmeidel said. Schmeidel went on to say that the college reserves the right to remove reporters from the Student Center because it's a private campus. Hemingway is probably behind the attacks. It's all a plot to sell books. Private school, so.. they can remove you for any reason they want. It's not enough to say "we need to destroy ISIS". I would only support US ground troops back in Iraq and Syria under the following conditions: Large coalition of other nations involved, including Turkey, Western Europe, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia and Iraq, etc. These folks would be on the front lines, with the US providing mostly weapons, special ops, technological and strategic support. Clearly identified goals and terms of surrender. How do we know the war is won? What do we want from Daesh? What is it that we are trying to accomplish? Clearly define who is the legitimate ruler of the land that we would be liberating. Who is going to control and govern this land, once ISIS is destroyed? This must be determined and agreed upon ahead of time, by all nations involved. Reimbursement from the international community for the TOTAL cost of waging the war and for the medical care for all of our wounded, for the rest of their lives. (This could take the form of an annual payment for the next 100 years or whatever). This is exactly why I voted for Obama. To keep us out of unwinnable situations. I give him credit for this. I suppose you have a more reasonable explanation? I think they might have an easier time with this in the South. Those folks have been pushing for this, for years! Isn't all that burning oil bad for the environment? Maybe we could talk to them about recycling it, instead? Yeah, but if we keep it, Lockheed and Boeing can't get a billion dollars to develop a new one. So... you know.. Wall Street doesn't like that. I don't want to argue the point, but there is good religion and false religion.
