Well, well, well. It seems like the Democratic Party is in quite a pickle. The establishment has chosen Hillary Clinton as their anointed candidate, but the people are not so sure. Bernie Sanders has raised an incredible amount of money from small donations and has quickly built up volunteer support all over the country. And now, even some Democrats are starting to turn against Hillary. Take the recent incident where a woman paid $500 to interrupt a fancy gathering of rich folks to confront Hillary about something she said in the past. While it may seem hypocritical to interrupt a paid event, there are a few differences here. First, this woman was addressing something that Hillary said in the past, trying to hold her accountable. Second, Hillary is the anointed candidate with the full backing of the political machine, Wall Street, the military industry, and quite a few oligarchs. She is the overdog, and the underdogs get to gloat when she takes her lumps. But why is this such an issue? It's because the establishment chose Hillary as the designated candidate, and it's generating a ton of backlash. People are fighting hard against Hillary, and they should not just lie down and accept that the economic elite and the neocon backers have already chosen the candidate. If being a "true Democrat" means supporting Hillary, then Democrat doesn't mean anything more than blind support. And let's not forget about Hillary's track record. She has been involved in some pretty shady dealings, including her foreign policy work. Her policies are the stuff of neocon dreams and a total disaster. She supported the intervention in Libya, which has turned into a complete mess. And let's not forget about her ties to Wall Street and select oligarchs like Lady Lynn Rothschild. She has received more backing from the military industry than any candidate ever. But what about Bernie Sanders? He has been gaining a lot of support lately, and for good reason. He is anti-war and anti-big bank, which is a message that resonates with a lot of people. He would have the support of all the Democrats as well as many independents and some Republicans who like his message. And let's not forget about the recent controversy surrounding Hillary's speeches. She has been refusing to release the transcripts of her speeches to Wall Street, which has only fueled speculation about what she may have said. It's like she is trying to draw as much attention as possible to her speeches. She just makes it look like she has something to hide. If she wants to put this issue to rest, she should just release the speeches already and get it over with. But even if she does release the speeches, it may be too late. Hillary is unelectable, so not really sure what the Democratic Party is thinking. A Clinton nomination is an automatic win for the Republican nominee. She could probably beat Carson, but she has no chance against anyone else. As if any of the fervent Bernie supporters want anything to do with Hillary. Trump is closer to a liberal Democrat than Hillary. Why do you think Republican fat-cats are giving her money? Why do you think neocons like John McCain appreciate her foreign policy skills so much? They're one big happy family. And let's not forget about the recent controversy surrounding Hillary's emails. She used a private email server while she was Secretary of State, which is a huge security risk. And now, the FBI is investigating her for mishandling classified information. This is not the kind of person we want as our president. So what can the Democratic Party do? They need to start listening to the people and stop blindly supporting Hillary. They need to start supporting Bernie Sanders, who has a message that resonates with a lot of people. They need to start taking a stand against the economic elite and the neocon backers who are trying to control our government. In conclusion, the Democratic Party is in a tough spot. They have chosen Hillary as their anointed candidate, but the people are not so sure. Bernie Sanders has been gaining a lot of support lately, and for good reason. He is anti-war and anti-big bank, which is a message that resonates with a lot of people. Hillary, on the other hand, has a track record that is less than stellar. She has ties to Wall Street and select oligarchs, and her foreign policy work is a disaster. The Democratic Party needs to start listening to the people and stop blindly supporting Hillary. They need to start supporting Bernie Sanders, who has a message that resonates with a lot of people.
