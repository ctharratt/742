I remember the first time I rode on a motorcycle. It was with my ex-boyfriend, and it was on our second date. We rode down the highway, the wind whipping through our hair, and I felt so alive. It was exhilarating, and I couldn't help but feel a rush of excitement as we zoomed past cars and trucks. But apparently, that stretch of pavement was special to him. He said it was because it was where we rode on our second date. I didn't really understand why that made it special, but I guess everyone has their own reasons for why certain things hold significance to them. Speaking of significance, do you remember when Albert Haynesworth stomped on Cowboys center Andre Gurode's head? That was a crazy incident, and it resulted in a 5-game suspension for Haynesworth, which was unprecedented at the time. It's crazy to think that this happened before the Redskins gave him that ridiculous $100 million contract that turned out to be one of the worst signings in NFL history. How someone can witness someone do something so stupid and still think they're worth that kind of money is beyond me. But let's move on to something more positive. I'm so glad to see Carli Lloyd getting some love. Her talk was amazing, and there were so many great lines in it. I especially loved when she talked about how we congratulate ourselves for punching up and how unpaid shaming interns work for Google. It's so true, and it's important to recognize these issues and work towards fixing them. On a completely different note, have you ever seen an AMA request for the guy someone's girlfriend blew and did coke with in the bathroom? That's just ridiculous. I mean, who cares about that kind of stuff? It's not like it's important or relevant in any way. Speaking of irrelevant things, do you remember those basement Calvin Klein ads? They were so awful and cringe-worthy. I can't believe anyone thought they were a good idea. But let's talk about something more serious. What are your thoughts on hormonal therapy for pre-adolescents? Personally, I feel like labeling a child as trans has less to do with their gender identity and more to do with a misinterpretation, by both child and parent, of the child not conforming to gender roles. On the other hand, starting hormonal therapy early may be the best chance for the child to "pass" later in life. It's a complex issue, and I'm always curious to hear people's opinions on it. And let's not forget about Planet Fitness. I mean, who doesn't love working out while eating pizza and donuts? It's the perfect combination. But seriously, let's not feed the trolls. They're just looking for attention, and it's not worth engaging with them. Now, let's talk about something that's actually important. The bee population is in danger, and we need to do something about it. While biking electricity may not be a viable solution, perhaps it can be a gateway drug to get people interested in traditional beekeeping. We need to find ways to protect these important pollinators and ensure their survival. And speaking of survival, have you ever had to pay a ridiculous amount of money to your neighbor just to avoid a lawsuit? It's crazy how much people will try to take advantage of others. But let's not forget about the bees. We need to find ways to protect them and ensure their survival. And if that means stealing someone's 4 million dollars, then so be it. But seriously, let's not forget about the bees. We need to find ways to protect them and ensure their survival. And if that means finding a non-bee-disturbing wax remover, then let's get to work on it. And let's not forget about the importance of sportsmanship. It's frustrating when a game turns on a fluke play, but it's also part of the game. And let's not forget about the importance of learning new things, like craps. It may seem intimidating at first, but it's actually a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. And let's not forget about the importance of standing up for what's right. It's easy to turn a blind eye to injustice, but we need to speak out and make our voices heard. Whether it's standing up to carjackers or fighting against oppressive regimes, we need to do what we can to make the world a better place. And let's not forget about the importance of humor. Life can be tough, but sometimes all we need is a good laugh to get us through the day. Whether it's a silly joke or a funny meme, laughter is truly the best medicine. In conclusion, there are a lot of important issues in the world, from the bee population to social justice to sportsmanship. But no matter what, we need to remember to find joy in life and to never stop fighting for what's right. And who knows, maybe one day we'll all ride down a special stretch of pavement on a motorcycle and feel truly alive.
