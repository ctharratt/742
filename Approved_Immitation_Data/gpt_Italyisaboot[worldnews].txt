Yeah, man, it's crazy out there. The world is just a big mess of chaos and confusion. I mean, have you seen what's going on with ISIS and all that? It's like a medieval war or something. Kurds vs Turkey, Kurds vs ISIS, ISIS vs everyone, Russia/Iran/Assad vs everyone (except EU/NA powers). It's just utter chaos, man. And don't even get me started on the whole money situation. I mean, what even is money? It's just a floating currency that we all agree has value. But what happens if people stop believing in it? Then it's worthless. And if there's no life, then money has no value either. It's all just a big mess. But you know what the real problem is? Tribalism. It's like humanity's most notorious trait. We just can't help but hate things that are considered the "other". We divide into tribes over anything. If you raise a population of people on "red" land and then go raise a population on "blue" land and put a mountain between them and allow them to meet organically, they will find a way to hate each other. It's just how we are wired. And it's not just religion that causes this tribalism. It's nationalism, communism, capitalism, racism, and all those other isms. Everyone thinks their way of life is superior to everyone else's. But the truth is, it's the species' fault. The need for people to differentiate themselves from one another, and yet at the same time be a part of a group, is mildly interesting. But you know what's even more interesting? The fact that we're all just a bunch of clones. I mean, I was born in a cloning vat. And who knows how many other people out there are clones too? It's like we're all just copies of each other, but we still manage to find ways to hate each other. And then there's the whole issue of corruption. It's everywhere, man. Even in the West, you have legalized corruption at its highest since the gilded age. And can we really trust these countries to uphold and enact regulations to their fullest extent? I mean, there's just so much corruption out there. But you know what's really messed up? The fact that we're all just a bunch of animals. We like to think we're so much better than the other animals, but really, we're not. We're just as savage and brutal as they are. We just have better technology. And speaking of technology, have you seen what's going on with Venus? It's like a big greenhouse trap or something. And we have all this methane and carbon sitting under the ice caps. We're literally stepping on thin ice, man. But you know what the real problem is? The fact that we're all just a bunch of idiots. We don't know anything. We think we do, but we don't. We're just stumbling around in the dark, trying to make sense of this crazy world we live in. And you know what's really sad? The fact that we're all just going to die someday. We're all just going to fade away into nothingness. And what was the point of it all? What was the point of all this chaos and confusion? It's like we're all just spinning our wheels, going nowhere. But you know what? Despite all this, I still have hope. I still believe that we can make a difference. We can still make the world a better place. We just have to try. We have to keep pushing forward, even when it seems like everything is against us. So let's do it, man. Let's make a difference. Let's make the world a better place. Let's show everyone that we're not just a bunch of animals and idiots. Let's show them that we're capable of greatness.
