Ah, League of Legends. The game that we all love to hate and hate to love. It's a game that has brought us so much joy and frustration, and yet we keep coming back for more. But with all the good that comes with playing League, there are also some things that we just can't stand. So, let's talk about those things. First off, let's talk about the Tribunal. It's nice to know that some punished players change their ways, but let's be real here, the Tribunal is full of pointless cases that hide the real ones. Everyone seems to report for even the slightest disagreement, and it's clogging up the system. I mean, come on, every Gnar I see falls flat on his face. Normally 5 or more kills down. I might just be lucky to have not met a good Gnar yet though. At least he didn't come out the box as stupid OP as Yasuo. Windwall, Shield, High crit, and all that with no mana. Nerf pls. But let's move on to something that really grinds my gears: premade players that bully others. Some examples would be lying about who called a lane first, jointly harassing other players, lying in all chat in order to get someone reported. There's nothing worse than being stuck on a team of 4 premades that take a dislike to you for no reason. Botlane dies and you're playing Top, "Fuck you top, why you no help?! Report" then in all chat "Report toplane for flame and abuse!!". Yeah, I agree, not in ranked. In ranked, I would like to see some nicer behavior. But I've been in so many norm games where the team is losing, hard, but the other team can't quite win. It's been going on for what feels like weeks and 3 of us want to surrender, but the two premades, they think we can win (we can't) what a pain in the arse. And while we're on the topic of ranked, let's talk about the matchmaking system. I wouldn't be surprised if they do this, however, I would expect less LP for it. Some people might only be good in one role. Ranked is about being good in all roles. Source: I am Diamond III. Lol, no, I'm Bronze.... :( But let's not dwell on the negatives. Let's talk about some things that we would like to see in League. For starters, feedback on reports. I feel like people would take reports more seriously if they saw the outcome of their own reports. Maybe not loss forgiveness, but maybe a loss of less LP when you have AFK players on your team. Voice chat, mutable obviously, but I think it would help to be able to communicate verbally. Champion rental. Like a champ? Want to try him out for 24 hours? Pay 30 RP and give him/her a go. That way you don't have to wait for free champ rotation. 3-2 surrender vote after 30 minutes. If a game is an obvious loss, and 2 premade players REFUSE to surrender, the vote should change after 30 minutes. That way the majority of the team (the remaining 3) won't be forced to sit through a complete waste of time with two people who are trolling or just completely blind to their abysmal failure. And while we're on the topic of reports, maybe not say WHO got banned, but maybe a message saying "A player you reported has recently been reprimanded by the tribunal". It would be nice to know that our reports are actually doing something. But let's talk about something that affects us all: server issues. I mean, come on, Riot. A fucking Wednesday! I can understand weekends with the influx of players, but a Wednesday?! Cannot wait until they get the Amsterdam servers up and running! I just finished a game, waiting for stats screen didn't load, no game in my match history. Logged out, went to log back in, queue of 20,000. I'm assuming something has fucked up. That was my best game in ages too. 20/3/19 with Xerath and I got a double kill to stop them from taking our Nexus! :( No history of it, no honor. But let's not forget about the in-game issues. Kill stealing. It's a touchy subject, but let's be real here, it's a team game. Teamfights I completely agree are Kill Secure. What I dislike are my example above. 1v1 fight in lane. I do 90% damage, I WILL kill, there is no chance of my death or their escape. And then someone uses one ability to steal it. I just see that as greedy. Assists get LESS gold when divided though, and it means Soraka in this example is wasting a cooldown and mana that needn't be used. And as I keep mentioning, she didn't ward AT ALL, let alone 3 times. She did not place a single ward. Not a "secure" if they weren't getting away anyway though is it. Just a kill. I think it's frustrating, I might be wrong here, but it is my understanding that assists (when divided) get less gold and XP? And while we're on the topic of in-game issues, let's talk about bullying. I don't think telling people to "get their head out their asses" is a team game mentality. I was the ADC, as you may have guessed from Soraka being the other champ she was support. Supports are primarily the warders in bot lane. I asked her to ward, she said no. I ended up spending gold on wards, when as the ADC I should really be focusing on build. As for the KSing. I don't think anyone seriously thinks Soraka or any other support should take kills from the ADC, and I don't mean by accident. I mean purposeful "haha I got your kill" KSing. I DID ward my lane. But aren't you typical of the League community telling me off when you have no idea what happened. Good for you Mr. High n Mighty. Calling KS is getting a bad re these days due to too many people calling it for the wrong reason. But one-shotting a kill from the ADC is just greedy and stupid, you get an underfed ADC. I got angry at them, but it's because I had four people all blaming me when I was trying my best. I think I ended up 4/7/12 I had so many assists! My support or the jungler would take kills, Soraka didn't place a single ward and Vel'Koz fed their Yi 0/7 before he killed anyone. So I have them all raging at me, calling me a noob and blaming me for ruining their "winning game". I LOVE playing LoL but fuck bullying like that man! In conclusion, League of Legends is a great game, but it's not without its flaws. The Tribunal needs work, premade players need to stop bullying others, and the matchmaking system needs to be improved. But there are also things that we would like to see, such as feedback on reports, voice chat, and champion rental. And let's not forget about the server issues and in-game issues, such as kill stealing and bullying. We all love to play League, but let's work together to make it a better experience for everyone.
