Currently, my main focus is on improving the user interface of my game. I want to make it more visually appealing and easier to navigate. One of the things I plan to do is to get rid of the stats screens and put them in a GUI on the side of the screen. This will make it easier for players to keep track of their progress and see how their skills are improving. In addition to this, I also want to add glowing icons next to the stats that explain the skill. This will make it easier for players to understand what each skill does and how it can be used to their advantage. I found it a bit awkward having to shoehorn in explanations for the magical skills, so this will be a welcome addition. Another thing I plan to do is to make just the text fade out (not the whole GUI) and have the GUI slide into position for the next set of paragraphs. This will make the game feel more dynamic and engaging, and will help to keep players interested and invested in the story. I've also updated the game by adding custom scrollbars for users on Chrome (not supported in Firefox). This will make it easier for players to navigate through the game and find the information they need. I've also added a little credits area at the top of the page, so players can see who worked on the game and who contributed to its development. While I'm glad that some people can work for the sole incentive of enjoying working, this is not true of myself. My work will not be published freely, but if anyone would like to pirate it, there is nothing I could do to stop them and I do not intend to do so. Anyone can publish an app, but I will not bend my standards to differentiate myself from the market. It's most likely never going on a mobile device store, anyway. It's not quite as motivating to work for hours a day with no hope of a payoff. Besides the profit, it feels like more of an accomplishment to publish a purchasable game. Anyone can post a free game, but I think it creates a better game in whole when there is a financial incentive to make it the best it can be. If you are curious, I write between 12-16 paragraphs a day. 12 paragraphs is about 1K words with the code included. Anyone is free to contribute ideas for scenes and even fully written ones, however I am reluctant to let anyone view my source code prior to release. There will also be no compensation other than perhaps a place in the credits. The game will always be browser-based. When the full version is downloaded, it will launch as a file executed by your browser, unlinkable to anyone else. It will not require an internet connection, as I am opposed to DRM. Just a default browser. I felt really proud of getting 80 upvotes on my last post. Then I posted a picture of my cat and it got three thousand. I guess the moral of the story is that nothing can compete with photos of kittens. One of the things I'm struggling with right now is making the game less text-heavy. At the moment, it looks like it was made in the late 90s, and I want to make it more visually appealing and engaging. I was thinking of having some moving background elements, but I just can't decide on what to have. I'm hoping to release the game on Desura (and also without a retailer) for about $5. It's going to be open-source and DRM-free, so hopefully people can make their own things with it. I think this will be a great way to get more people involved in the development process and to make the game even better. Overall, I'm really excited about the progress I've made on the game so far. I think it has a lot of potential, and I'm looking forward to seeing how it develops over time. I'm always open to feedback and suggestions, so if you have any ideas for how I can improve the game, please let me know!
