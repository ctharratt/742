Completely irrelevant to OP, but Happy Birthday to whoever is celebrating today! It's always nice to have a reason to celebrate, even if it's just a Reddit birthday. Speaking of celebrations, I'm really excited to try out the PPS. All the posters with the PPS have really piqued my interest in this gun. I'm thinking about going Walther hunting on Monday and seeing if I can find a range that has one for rental. I already have the LCP, but the PPS seems like it would be a great conceal gun and the added size might make it more comfortable for me to shoot. Thanks to all the posters for the great info! I have to say, that slide on the PPS looks almost exactly like my XDs slide when it's off the weapon. I'm not really familiar with Kahr, but it looks like a solid handgun. Maybe I'll add it to my list for research and hopeful range time in the near future.  I'm glad to hear that there aren't any ammo issues with the PPS. I saw a video that made me think otherwise, but it's good to know that it's not a problem. I'm really looking forward to getting my hands on one.  I have long, thin fingers, so I can get two on the LCP no problem. I'm thinking about buying the extended magazine for it so I can grip with my pinky as well. I'll have to check out the PPS to compare the difference in size, but I wasn't really looking for a pocket gun. The LCP just happened to work as a pocket or IWB.  I love the idea of having both the LCP and the PPS. I don't know if I necessarily need both, but it would be great to have options. I agree that the LCP isn't great for range shooting, but I've carried it multiple times in public and had no worries about it being bulky, visible, or otherwise noticeable. It's also very comfortable even on my side (hip) IWB. Thanks to all the great posters for the info! I actually purchased some of those expanding rounds for my defensive magazine. I looked at the Crimson Trace grip laser for the LCP, but I'm afraid getting that would cause it to no longer fit in the holsters I've already purchased for it. It's kind of odd how it fits. Instead of on the grip, it goes under the trigger guard and has one small point on the front of the grip for the activation point. Here's the product page if you're interested. That Bodyguard 380 looks awesome! Unfortunately, I didn't see that or the PPS before purchasing the LCP. I'm a bit of an impulse buyer, so the LCP was there and it worked. Money isn't really that big of a deal for me, and I would much rather add to my collection than take away from it. So perhaps I'll just wait a bit and find a PPS and/or Bodyguard and give them both a good rundown and look over.  I think waiting a bit and picking up the PPS is the way to go. I wasn't really aware of the PPS so much, but when I was browsing for a small carry weapon, the LCP was there and seemed to fit the bill perfectly. I really don't have much bad to say about the gun, and it's effective for what I want to use it for, but the PPS has a bit more appeal to me for some reason. It would be great to just have both, so I'll likely just wait a bit and pick one up. That will also give me more time to research and find a good holster for it as well. Thanks to all the posters for the great advice! I have fairly large hands as well, mostly just long "piano" fingers, so the small size of the LCP is a bit off-putting to me. But it is extremely comfortable to carry, even wearing basketball shorts. Since it's so lightweight, it doesn't even pull them down.  What are your thoughts on the mag release being a part of the trigger guard? Have you ever felt that you may accidentally hit the trigger in any way when pulling the release? I've also heard that the PPS is very picky with ammo brands. Have you had any bad experience with certain brands?  I had a similar experience with a cop the other day. I had just been stuck in a cluster of about 10 cars and pulled away, then out of nowhere there's a cop standing in the middle divider area of the 4-lane street with his laser gun. He waits for the car in front of me to pass and jumps out at me to stop, nearly scared me to death. He told me where to pull into, and I did. He came up and asked why I was going so fast, and I didn't give any excuses. Then afterwards, we started talking about his awkward tactic of standing in traffic and how effective it likely was because of the surprise factor. Then somewhere in the conversation, I brought up something similar to "You've never driven a bimmer have you? It's incredibly easy to have a lead foot in this car." The cop was awesome and dropped my speed 10mph and let me on my way. It would've been an impound and likely jail time had he not done that. I definitely do not speed down that street anymore, and I drive it daily.  I keep my LCP in the same location. It's tucked pretty tightly, but yeah, it would surely go flying if in a horrible wreck. Although I doubt I'd be too worried about where my handgun is if I was in a wreck of that caliber. I'd likely be wondering why my guts were spewed on the floorboard.  Enjoy your gun! They are great guns, and I've had a lot of fun shooting mine at the range. I agree that bolt is ridiculous! Mine unfortunately starts to stick after a few rounds and begins to be really, really difficult to disengage. I've busted up my palm pretty bad trying to release it before. I got mine redone by my best friend's father for Christmas. I don't know much about the stuff that's on it (by the time I really got into the gun and wanted to know, my friend's father had forgotten and there are no marks), but it's really an awesome rifle. Post some pics when you've made some progress.  Thanks for reading my ramblings, and thanks to all the posters for the great info and advice!
