Hey Jane, I just wanted to say a huge thank you for taking the time to answer all of our questions during your AMA. I was blown away by how many questions you managed to respond to, especially considering the time difference between Europe and the US. I posted a bunch of questions before going to bed last night and woke up to find that you had already answered so many of them! I'm still reading through all of your responses, but I just wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude. I'm really excited about your upcoming games, and I'm definitely going to take your advice and check out Gray Matter. Do you have any news on whether it will become available on gog.com or Steam any time soon? I remember you mentioning that you would talk to the publisher about it a few weeks ago. I'm also curious about your thoughts on video game studies and how important they are for the future development of the industry. Do you follow this type of discourse, particularly discussions about the narrative possibilities in video games? I'm always interested in hearing from developers about their perspectives on this. Speaking of upcoming games, are there any that you're particularly looking forward to playing? And do you think that writing talent is properly respected in today's game industry? If not, what do you think should be done differently? I'm also curious about whether you would ever consider doing an episodic game like what Telltale is doing, releasing a longer story arc in smaller individual episodes. And what do you think are the challenges that adventure game designers face today? How have players changed from what they were in the 90s, and how do you accommodate new players? I'm a big fan of point-and-click adventure games, and I'm curious to know which modern ones you've enjoyed (post Sierra & LucasArts). And speaking of Sierra, were there ever any plans for a Gabriel Knight film? And have you ever considered attempting to write a screenplay (of anything, not just GK)? I know that you're probably most well-known for the Gabriel Knight games, but I'm also interested in hearing about your post-GK3 career. Can you briefly summarise it and maybe recommend some titles that you've worked on that people should check out? And on the topic of graphics, I've always thought that the original Gabriel Knight has aged much better than GK2 and GK3, which feel quite dated today. Did you realise that this would be the case when designing the sequels? And when developing Moebius and other Pinkerton Road Studio games, have you spent any time planning how to make sure that the games still look as fresh in 15 years' time as the first Gabriel Knight looks today? I'm also curious about the rivalry between Sierra and LucasArts back in the day. How closely did you follow their output and discuss their development philosophy? Finally, I just wanted to say that I appreciate your use of the "reply" button under each comment during the AMA. It made it much easier to follow the conversation and read your responses. And thanks for all the amazing games over the years!
