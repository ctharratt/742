Rotten Tomatoes has become a household name in the world of film criticism. It's a website that aggregates reviews from various sources and assigns a score based on the percentage of positive reviews. While it's not a perfect system, it's become a go-to source for many moviegoers looking to decide what to watch. One interesting aspect of Rotten Tomatoes is its scores for Best Picture winners. These are films that have been deemed the best of the best by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, yet some of them have surprisingly low scores on Rotten Tomatoes. For example, the 1929 film "Broadway Melody" has a Rotten Tomatoes score of just 35%. This is the lowest score of any Best Picture winner. The film was one of the first musicals and one of the first talkies, so it's possible that at the time it was groundbreaking and impressive. However, as the form was perfected over the years, "Broadway Melody" may have lost some of its luster. It's also worth noting that many of the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes are from people who watched the film decades after its release, so their opinions may be influenced by the passage of time. The second-lowest score for a Best Picture winner belongs to "The Greatest Show on Earth" (1952) with a score of 44%. This film was directed by Cecil B. DeMille and starred Charlton Heston, but it's not remembered as one of the greats. The third-lowest score belongs to "Cimarron" (1931) with a score of 53%. This film was based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel and was one of the first Westerns to win Best Picture, but it's not as well-known as some of the other winners. It's interesting to see how the perception of these films has changed over time. Some of them were critical and commercial successes at the time of their release, but they've since been overshadowed by other films. Others may have been groundbreaking in their day, but they haven't aged well. It's a reminder that the passage of time can have a significant impact on how we view art. Of course, Rotten Tomatoes isn't the only source of film criticism. There are many other websites and publications that offer their own opinions on movies. However, Rotten Tomatoes has become one of the most influential, in part because of its simplicity. The site's scores are easy to understand and provide a quick snapshot of critical consensus. It's not a perfect system, but it's become a useful tool for many moviegoers. Speaking of movies, the Academy Awards are coming up soon. This year's ceremony will be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel and will feature a number of high-profile presenters and performers. One of the most anticipated categories is Best Picture, which features nine nominees this year. The frontrunners are "La La Land" and "Moonlight," but there are several other strong contenders as well. It's always interesting to see how the Academy Awards play out. Sometimes the winners are predictable, but other times there are surprises. One of the most famous surprises in Oscar history was the 1941 ceremony, when "How Green Was My Valley" beat out "Citizen Kane" and "The Maltese Falcon" for Best Picture. While "How Green Was My Valley" is a classic film in its own right, it's not remembered as fondly as the other two films. Another interesting aspect of the Academy Awards is the red carpet fashion. Celebrities spend months preparing for this event, choosing the perfect dress or suit and getting their hair and makeup done. The fashion choices are often dissected by the media and the public, with some outfits being praised and others being criticized. Of course, the Academy Awards aren't just about glitz and glamour. They're also an opportunity to recognize the best in filmmaking. This year's nominees include some truly outstanding films, and it will be exciting to see who takes home the top prizes. In conclusion, Rotten Tomatoes has become a popular source of film criticism, but it's not the only one. The site's scores for Best Picture winners can be surprising, with some films that were once considered great now receiving low scores. The Academy Awards are coming up soon, and it will be interesting to see who takes home the top prizes. Whether you're a film buff or just a casual moviegoer, there's always something to enjoy about the Oscars.
