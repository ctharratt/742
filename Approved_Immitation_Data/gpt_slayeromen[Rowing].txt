Winter Erg/Training Plan: Tips and Tricks for Rowing Success Winter is the perfect time to focus on indoor rowing and build up your strength and endurance for the upcoming rowing season. Whether you're a seasoned rower or just starting out, a winter erg/training plan can help you achieve your goals and improve your performance on the water. In this article, we'll share some tips and tricks for creating an effective winter erg/training plan that will help you become a better rower. First and foremost, it's important to have a plan in place before you start your winter training. This plan should include your goals for the season, as well as a detailed schedule of your workouts. You should also consider your current fitness level and any injuries or limitations you may have, as these factors will impact the type and intensity of your workouts. When creating your winter erg/training plan, it's important to focus on both endurance and strength training. Endurance training will help you build up your cardiovascular fitness and improve your ability to row for longer periods of time. Strength training, on the other hand, will help you build muscle and improve your power and speed on the water. One effective way to incorporate both endurance and strength training into your winter erg/training plan is to use heart rate training zones. Heart rate training zones are based on your maximum heart rate and are used to determine the intensity of your workouts. By training in different heart rate zones, you can target different aspects of your fitness and improve your overall performance. For example, training in Zone 1 (60-70% of your maximum heart rate) is ideal for building endurance and improving your aerobic fitness. This type of training involves longer, steady-state workouts at a moderate intensity. Training in Zone 2 (70-80% of your maximum heart rate) is ideal for improving your lactate threshold and increasing your anaerobic capacity. This type of training involves shorter, high-intensity intervals with periods of rest in between. In addition to heart rate training zones, it's also important to vary the type and intensity of your workouts throughout the week. This will help prevent boredom and keep your body challenged. Some effective workouts to include in your winter erg/training plan include: - Steady-state workouts: These workouts involve rowing at a moderate intensity for a longer period of time (30-60 minutes). They are ideal for building endurance and improving your aerobic fitness. - Interval workouts: These workouts involve alternating periods of high-intensity rowing with periods of rest or low-intensity rowing. They are ideal for improving your anaerobic capacity and increasing your lactate threshold. - Strength training workouts: These workouts involve using weights or resistance bands to build muscle and improve your power and speed on the water. They can include exercises such as squats, lunges, deadlifts, and rows. - Cross-training workouts: These workouts involve incorporating other forms of exercise, such as cycling, running, or swimming, into your training plan. They can help prevent boredom and improve your overall fitness. When it comes to equipment, the Concept2 rowing machine is the gold standard for indoor rowing. It provides a smooth, realistic rowing experience and is used by many professional rowers and coaches. However, if you don't have access to a Concept2 machine, there are other options available, such as the WaterRower or the Stamina ATS Air Rower. Regardless of the type of rowing machine you use, it's important to maintain it properly to ensure optimal performance. This includes regularly cleaning and lubricating the chain, checking the sprocket for wear, and adjusting the drag factor to your desired level. In addition to equipment maintenance, it's also important to pay attention to your form and technique while rowing. This includes maintaining a straight back, engaging your core muscles, and using a smooth, fluid motion throughout the stroke. If you're unsure about your form, consider working with a coach or taking a rowing class to get feedback and guidance. Finally, it's important to stay motivated and consistent throughout your winter erg/training plan. This can be challenging, especially when the weather is cold and dark outside. To stay motivated, consider setting specific goals for yourself, such as rowing a certain distance or improving your split time. You can also track your progress using a training log or app, and celebrate your achievements along the way. In conclusion, a winter erg/training plan can be a great way to improve your rowing performance and build up your strength and endurance for the upcoming season. By incorporating heart rate training zones, varying your workouts, maintaining your equipment, and staying motivated, you can achieve your goals and become a better rower.
