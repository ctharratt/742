I gotta say, I'm not a fan of Bernie having himself pulled by an ox. I mean, what's the point? Is he trying to prove something? And don't even get me started on the whole "rainbow bridge" thing. I mean, come on, that's just ridiculous. But hey, at least he's a Stephen King fan, right? That's something we can all agree on. Now, let's talk about this alien from Dreamcatchers. That thing was freaky, man. And don't even get me started on the goat fuckers. I mean, what kind of sick, twisted event is that? And why do they need fresh towels? It's just all so messed up. But let's get to the real issue here: gay marriage. Now, I know there are a lot of opinions on this, but hear me out. I think it's hypocritical for gays to be against incestuous marriages between consenting adults. I mean, if they're all about consenting adults being able to marry who they love, then why not let a father marry his adult son? It's just as consenting as two men or two women getting married. And don't even get me started on the left's "tolerance" and "no hate" mantra. It's all a bunch of BS. They only tolerate those who agree with them, and they hate anyone who doesn't. And let's not forget about their unnecessary programs that create dependence and ensure votes. It's all just a ploy to keep people under their control. But you know what? I may not agree with socialist and redistributionist views, but at least those who hold them are honest about wanting what the other guy earned. It's better than the false outrage and victim mentality that so many on the left have adopted. In the end, it's all about personal responsibility and taking ownership of our own lives. We can't rely on the government or anyone else to solve our problems for us. We have to do it ourselves. And that's something that both the left and the right can agree on.
