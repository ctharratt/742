The Middle East is a region of chaos, and Turkey has lost its geopolitical compass. Once a pivotal power in the Middle East, Turkey has become a zone of instability. The lofty hopes of a democratic spring have turned to dust, and the Syrian refugees on the streets of Istanbul tell a different story. Turkey's troubles abroad have been matched by authoritarianism at home, and the government is tortured by its paranoia. The protests last year in Istanbul's Gezi Park have been followed by a tightening of the screw over the media and business. Kemal Ataturk's secular state looks less secular day by day. In a region torn by confessional conflict between Sunni and Shia, Turkey's leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, sounds more and more like a Sunni supremacist. Troubles abroad have been matched by authoritarianism at home. Mr Erdogan is the most popular politician in Turkey, and his summer move from the premiership to the presidency was endorsed by a hefty majority. His allegiance, though, is to majoritarianism rather than to liberal democracy.  There was nothing much wrong with the original foreign policy ambition, even if it sometimes carried a nostalgic whiff of the Ottoman Caliphate. Nor, beyond a certain hubris, was it a crazy idea that Turkey's settlement between democracy and Islam could serve as a template for pluralist politics elsewhere. Mr Erdogan, though, bet the bank on the fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and the success in Egypt of the Muslim Brotherhood. He lost to a civil war and a military coup.  The opening of Turkey's border to the flow of anti-Assad jihadis into Syria has helped turn large tracts of territory in Syria and Iraq into the nightmare that its followers have called the Islamic State. More than a million refugees have fled to Turkey. Elsewhere, Mr Erdogan has fallen out with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states over their backing for Egypt's new strongman Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. A tentative warming of relations with Iran has been scuppered by Tehran's sponsorship of Mr Assad. The fracturing of post-imperial national borders has reawakened Ankara's fear of an independent Kurdish state reaching from Iraq and Syria into Turkey.  Mr Erdogan suddenly looks a leader caught in no-man's land. Old friends in the west have little sympathy. In its eagerness to topple the Syrian regime, Turkey did little to discriminate between the "good guys" of the moderate Syrian opposition and extremists for whom the fight was always about more than Mr Assad. Even now, after they have signed up to the US-led coalition against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or Isis, the Turks are conflicted. The government worries about the export of Isis terrorism to Istanbul. More importantly, it wants to avoid making a choice between defeating Isis and removing Mr Assad.  Such tensions are not uniquely Turkish. Like glorious Istanbul, everyone in the region is looking in two directions. Saudi aircraft are flying sorties against Isis fighters, but Saudi Arabia remains the principal source of the fundamentalist theology that is the foundation stone for the jihadis. If Riyadh agrees that things have got out of hand, it does not want to disempower the Sunni chiefs who have provided support for the jihadi self-proclaimed caliphate. That would be to aid the Shia-led government in Baghdad; and, worse, to give succour to Iraq's ally and Saudi Arabia's eternal enemy â€“ Shia Iran.  To a greater or lesser degree, the wealthy Gulf states display the same ambivalence: Isis should be checked, but not at the expense of handing victory to Mr Assad's sponsor in Tehran. Here lies the fatal flaw in the west's promise to destroy Isis. In military terms, it does not look an absurd proposition. For all their looted cash and military kit, the 20,000 or so fighters occupy a landlocked space surrounded by hostile forces. Destroying Isis, however, demands more than western air strikes or, for that matter, boots on the ground. It requires a single-minded political as well as a military commitment on the part of the regional powers to a post-Isis settlement.  For Turkey and Saudi Arabia, regime change in Damascus and settling scores with Iran take precedence over any such accommodation between Shia and Sunni. Yet the moderate Syrian opposition ready to replace Mr Assad is a threadbare fiction. The west is left leading an intervention that lacks a clearly defined political ambition and a military exit strategy. Stemming the jihadi tide to prevent the collapse of Iraq was one thing; waging an open-ended war against Sunni extremists in Syria quite another. It is easy to see why Barack Obama embarked on the project with such deep reluctance.  The lesson for the US president from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has been that, to the extent that the west can do anything much in the Middle East, it can only be with the buy-in of regional powers. Isis can be defeated only when Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the rest decide which way they want to look.  Saudi Arabia's ultraconservative brand of Islam is again in the sights of critics who say it underpins the extremist ideology of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis). But in the country itself, the open soul-searching about the role of Wahhabi Islam following the 9/11 attacks on the US is noticeably absent. Some of the features of Isis ideology, such as its hatred of Shia Muslims and application of strict punishments such as limb amputations, are shared with the purist Salafi thought that defines Saudi Wahhabism.  Isis has explicitly referenced early Wahhabi teachers, such as Mohammed ibn Abdulwahhab, to justify its destruction of Shia shrines and Christian churches as it cuts a swath through Iraq and Syria. Thousands of Saudi nationals have been recruited to its ranks. Yet, in contrast to the tacit official encouragement of more liberal voices after 9/11, any debate within Saudi Arabia over the role of its official creed in fostering the group's extremism has been timid and largely confined to social media.  "Unfortunately, we are still in denial," journalist Jamal Khashoggi said. Writing in Saudi-owned pan-Arab daily Al-Hayat in June, he said: "It is time we asked 'what went wrong' and let's search within ourselves." The Saudi authorities have been quick to condemn Isis. But, according to observers, they are anxious to avoid a potentially destabilising examination of common ideological links between the extremist group and the Saudi religious school whose support underpins the legitimacy of the royal family.  In conclusion, the Middle East is a region of chaos, and Turkey has lost its geopolitical compass. The lofty hopes of a democratic spring have turned to dust, and the Syrian refugees on the streets of Istanbul tell a different story.
