It's a sad reality that the argument against free college education always seems to boil down to "I don't want to pay for someone else's education." This mentality is not only selfish but also short-sighted. We need to look at the bigger picture and understand that investing in education is investing in our future. I live in Ontario, and let me tell you, 50K a year does not go far. The cost of living is high, and there are no small apartments for less than $800 a month. Groceries for one person cost $50 - $80 a week, and taxes are much higher than in the US. The point of free education is to make life manageable for those on a lower income so that they have the ability to work their way out of that income bracket. Trust me, living on 50K a year or less is not fun in Ontario. The article states that the plan includes increased grants for families making 83K a year or less. I agree with this. During my first year of college, I saw half of my classmates drop out because they weren't prepared for the workload. I grew up in the US and had to jump through the SAT hoops to get into college in Canada. While the material may not be "relevant," it shows that you can take the initiative to study and prepare yourself for something as monumental as the SAT. With this plan in effect, we need something like this to avoid dropouts wasting taxpayer money. I understand that the education system is different in Canada, and we don't have SAT scores or "multi-cultural" based admittance to the extent of the US. However, this plan is not about equalizing the playing field from a racial or cultural point of view. It's about equalizing the playing field from an economic point of view. Students still have to meet the standard to get in, but this plan helps those in poverty who don't turn to crime. If you agree that this plan will help gang members, then it will also help their community. Less violence, less crime, and a better environment to raise families are all positive outcomes. Those in poverty won't pay any more taxes; they are simply moving money around, not adding a whole new tax. We need to think about why we are doing this. We need to have a hard think about the different experiences that low-income youth have in high school. Imagine if your mother was selling herself on the streets to keep you fed, or if you had to work two jobs to feed your siblings. Imagine if your dad got shot in the night, or if your parents weren't home to encourage you or help you with your homework. Low-income youth are the most at-risk youth for crime and falling behind because of societal challenges. Why should they go the legitimate way to success when society has left them behind? They see their fathers and friends in gangs, becoming successful through monetary gain to attain what our society views as success in a physical means through a differential opportunity tailored to their circumstances. It has nothing to do with their money; it has to do with our society's treatment of low-income families. We need to think about the socio-economic catalysts to gang activity. Gangs are not spawns of certain racialized groups; gangs are a response to an ailment in society somewhere. At some point, gang activity became the preferable pursuit for these at-risk youth, and we need to understand why. These children are not dumb; they are just societally challenged. University education can help reduce gang activity. If these low-income youth see a way out of poverty, see that they have a chance at being treated equally under a system that has historically been leaning towards those with more money, they are more likely to take the legitimate path, then fall into the steps of their fathers and friends who take illegitimate paths to "success." I understand that some people may think that poor equals dumb, but that is not the case. What kid fresh out of high school can afford college or university tuition on their own? It's not about me; it's about those who cannot move. Those so deep in poverty or those working their asses off to just stay afloat. Not everyone can "just move." We need to look at the bigger picture and how this can affect different industries and social nooks. This is about attending to the lower class that has historically not had the same chance as those with better economic circumstances. You don't qualify as living on your own even if you move out unless you have been out of high school for four years on OSAP. It's either get a job or go right to school. The demographics of low-income youth and those involved in gang crime do overlap. This plan is an attempt to change the lives of at-risk youth into ones productive to society. The idea is to remove any disillusion these kids may have with pursuing higher education by making it more attainable and more equal, so as to not encourage deviancy as an alternate path to success of which gang crime represents. It's about countering the culture left behind by those of higher economic status. The cost of living in Ontario and the GTA is high, and finding an apartment in the ghetto for less than $800 a month is nearly impossible. All reputable colleges and universities are in the GTA area, on average. This plan is not about those who are involved in gang crime currently, but rather those at-risk youth growing up in an environment where they can be more successful through less work gangbanging than going to school and working two minimum wage jobs. We need to look into differential opportunity theory and Merton's strain theory to understand how this plan can positively affect at-risk youth. The idea is that those who don't live with mommy and daddy but are still low-income can benefit from this themselves. We need to think about the pros of this plan. It can reduce the need for strict policing, court costs, and prison costs. It can revamp industry with higher wages and more spending. I have student loans myself and am crossing my fingers for a little attention too. In conclusion, we need to understand that investing in education is investing in our future. We need to look at the bigger picture and understand that this plan is not just about free education; it's about equalizing the playing field from an economic point of view. We need to think about the socio-economic catalysts to gang activity and how this plan can positively affect at-risk youth. We need to think about the pros of this plan and how it can reduce the need for strict policing, court costs, and prison costs. We need to invest in education to invest in our future.
