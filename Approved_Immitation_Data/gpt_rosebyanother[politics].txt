The Republican Party has been facing a number of challenges in recent years, and while some of these have been discussed in the media, there are deeper issues that are not being addressed. One of the most fundamental problems facing the GOP is demographics. The party has traditionally relied on the support of white men, particularly those who hold racist views. However, the percentage of such individuals in the population is declining, which means that the party is losing its base. This decline in support is not the only issue facing the GOP. There is also a split between wealthy and working-class Republicans, with the latter group increasingly supporting Donald Trump. This is because they feel that establishment Republicans do not represent them in any meaningful way. They are catching on to the fact that both parties represent the 1% first and foremost, thanks in part to the Occupy movement. The media coverage of Obama's recent press conference is a case in point. While the Supreme Court and Trump dominated the headlines, there was little discussion of the TPP, which is a major issue for many Americans. Bernie Sanders has been one of the few politicians to address the issue of the TPP, and his recent debate performance was notable for his suggestion to audit the DOD. This received the most applause of the night, which shows that there is a real appetite for change among the American people. However, the mainstream media is not interested in discussing these issues, which is why the internet has become such an important tool for those who want to stay informed. One of the most important issues facing the GOP is gerrymandering. There are two types of gerrymandering, and both parties are guilty of engaging in it. The first type involves creating safe districts that have a large R or D voter base. This is bad because it means that politicians are not accountable to the people they represent. However, there is a second type of gerrymandering that is even worse. This involves creating districts that look like safe districts, but which actually have a slight majority of R voters. This is how it is in North Carolina, where the Democrats get more votes but the Republicans hold the majority. The Democrats are complicit in this type of gerrymandering because they do not want to be in charge, as this would mean that they would have to live up to their campaign promises. The good news is that this type of gerrymandering will eventually come crashing down around the Republicans, even if the Democrats remain complicit. This is because demographics are changing, and many of these districts will become Democratic if the party registers all of its potential voters and has a real GOTV effort. The formula is simple: less money for commercials and more for voter registration and GOTV. The Republicans have been successful in this area because they are willing to put in the time and money, while the Democrats are not. The issue of voter registration and GOTV is not a sexy one, and there are not two sides to argue. However, it is essential if the Democrats want to win elections. They need to register all of their potential voters, including those who are in prison or who have committed a felony in the past. One person, one vote. Period. This is a simple message that needs to be repeated over and over again. The media is not interested in discussing these issues because they are not newsworthy. They prefer to focus on the Supreme Court and Trump, which are predictable topics. However, this is a mistake because it means that the American people are not getting the information they need to make informed decisions. The internet has become an important tool for those who want to stay informed, but it is not enough. We need a media that is willing to report on the issues that matter, even if they are not sexy or newsworthy. The Republican Party is facing a number of challenges, and it is not clear how it will respond. It is possible that the party will continue to rely on its traditional base of white men, but this is unlikely to be a winning strategy in the long term. The split between wealthy and working-class Republicans is also a major issue, and it is not clear how the party will reconcile these two groups. The Democrats have their own problems, including gerrymandering and a lack of enthusiasm among their base. However, they have a real opportunity to win elections if they focus on voter registration and GOTV. This is not a sexy issue, but it is essential if they want to win.
