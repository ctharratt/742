Hey there, folks. I've got some words of wisdom for you. First off, let's talk about finding friends on the internet. Now, I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but you gotta be careful. Giving out your full name can lead to some serious trouble. I mean, think about it. Once someone has your name, they can find you on Facebook, and from there, they can see pictures of your apartment complex and even your room number. That's just asking for trouble, especially in a city like this one. There are a lot of scumbags out there, and you don't want to give them any more information than they need. Now, I know some of you might be thinking, "But, I need friends! What am I supposed to do?" Well, first off, don't panic. There are plenty of ways to make friends without putting yourself in danger. Join a club, go to a meetup, or even just strike up a conversation with someone at the coffee shop. You never know who you might meet. And speaking of meeting people, let's talk about penises. Yeah, I said it. Look, I don't know about you, but I've never been in a situation where I needed more than one penis. But hey, if that's your thing, more power to you. Just be safe about it, okay? Moving on, let's talk about finding a place to live. Now, the OP said they're looking for somewhere warm with something going on. Well, that narrows it down a bit, doesn't it? I mean, there are plenty of warm places in this country, but not all of them have something going on. And let's be real, nobody wants to live in the middle of nowhere. So, where should you go? Well, if you're looking for warmth, just draw a horizontal line from Los Angeles and go anywhere below it. That should give you plenty of options. And if you're looking for something to do, just avoid Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Lakeland, FL. Anywhere else should have something going on. But here's the thing, folks. Just because a place is warm and has something going on doesn't mean it's a good place to live. Take it from me, I've been around the block a few times. My lady and I moved to Orlando in February, and let me tell you, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Traffic, humidity, crime...it's not exactly paradise. Sure, there are some nice places in this country, but unless you're a tourist, Orlando is not one of them. Now, let's switch gears and talk about something a little more lighthearted. Have you guys seen that video for the concert? I mean, what even is that? It doesn't even advertise the event! I was hoping for some actual footage of past concerts, but nope. Just some weird animation. I don't get it. And while we're on the topic of things that don't make sense, can we talk about people who don't wave when you let them into your lane? I mean, come on, people. It's just common courtesy. If someone lets you in, you wave. It's not that hard. And don't even get me started on those jerks who take the bonus lane all the way to the end and then swerve through two lanes of traffic. That's just rude. But you know what? I've got a solution for that. Halfway on the actual exit lane and halfway on the bonus lane. That way, the cars behind you can't speed past all the stopped cars. It's a little thing, but it makes a big difference. And let me tell you, I get some serious satisfaction from thwarting those pit-lane passing jerks. In fact, I think we should make T-shirts. "I thwart pit-lane passing jerks." Who's with me? Anyway, that's all I've got for now, folks. Stay safe out there, and remember, always wave when someone lets you into their lane.
