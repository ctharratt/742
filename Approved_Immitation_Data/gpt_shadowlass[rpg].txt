Ah, secrets. The currency of the RPG world. There's nothing quite like the thrill of knowing something that the other players don't. It's like having a little piece of power that you can wield whenever you need it. And NPCs who deal in favors? Well, they're just the icing on the cake. I remember one campaign where we all had to come up with a reason why we owed a certain Mr. Johnson a favor. It was a great way to tie us all together and give us a common goal. Mr. Johnson was a resourceful guy, too. He always seemed to know someone who owed him a favor, and he wasn't afraid to call them in when he needed to. But we all knew that one day, he'd come knocking on our door, asking us to do something that ranged from the perfectly legal to the very, very shady. When it comes to ending a session, I find that a cliffhanger is always a good way to keep people coming back for more. We usually play for about four hours, but by the time someone has to leave, we're either at a breather point or a cliffhanger. It helps that we play weekly, too. As for changing systems, we do that pretty regularly. We'll play a campaign for as long as it makes sense and everyone's having fun, and then we'll switch to something else. We usually take a look at what different people would be willing to GM and then decide which system to try next. If you're looking for players or a group, I highly recommend checking out any shops in your area that sell games and the like. You can usually put up an ad there and find people who are interested in playing. I've found some great players and groups that way. As for systems, there are so many interesting ones out there that I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. Hunter: The Vigil is fantastic, though. It's incredibly versatile, and you can go in so many different directions with a campaign. Slay vampires? Hunt werewolves? Exorcise ghosts? Investigate serial killers? It's all possible. One of my favorite campaigns started out on a train. All of the PCs had to explain why they happened to be on that train at night, and then a vampire attacked one of the passengers. The only people who stepped up to fight him were the PCs. Another campaign had all of the players come up with a reason why they owed a certain NPC a favor. They all met when the guy decided to collect his favors to save his daughter. When it comes to playing in a fantasy setting, there are always ways to explain why a character might be absent. Maybe they're guarding something or someone, or maybe they're off curing a wound or illness. And if you're looking to involve your players more in the setting, try setting a scene in collaboration with them. Ask them to describe the place they're in or the people they're interacting with. It's a great way to get them invested in the world. And don't forget to give your players something that's theirs. Maybe it's an NPC they're fond of, or a bar they hang out at regularly. Maybe it's a running gag or a personal quest. Whatever it is, make it feel relevant to the plot and let your players run loose with it. Some of the most memorable game nights I've had were ones where we barely rolled any dice, but we were all engaged in conversation and figuring things out together. Of course, not every game night is going to be perfect. I once played with a group of players who prided themselves on "breaking" GMs. Needless to say, it was a disaster. They were more interested in drinking beer and telling stories than actually playing the game, and it was frustrating for everyone involved. So if you come across players like that, it's probably best to steer clear. At the end of the day, RPGs are all about having fun and telling a great story together. So don't be afraid to get creative, take risks, and let your players surprise you. Who knows? You might just end up with a campaign that's even better than you imagined.
