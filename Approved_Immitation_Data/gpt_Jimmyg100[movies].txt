The topic at hand is plot holes in popular movies, and boy do I have a lot to say about that. Let's start with Star Wars, specifically Episode IV. There's a line that goes, "Where did you work when you were stationed here?" "I was in sanitation." "Storm Troopers work in sanitation now?" "Well it's kinda hard to convince an independent contractor to install a toilet in your average planet destroying superweapon these days considering how they tend to get blown up... Case in point." Now, some people think this is a reference to the Death Star's trash compactors, but I think it's more of a direct reference to the fact that Storm Troopers are doing menial labor like sanitation work. It's a subtle nod to the fact that the Empire is not as powerful as it seems, and that even their elite soldiers are not immune to doing grunt work. Moving on to another sci-fi classic, Jurassic Park. In the first movie, InGen CEO John Hammond announces that they will be opening an amusement park in San Diego with real live dinosaurs cloned from prehistoric DNA. When a reporter asks if this means they have been cloning dinosaurs on an island, Hammond stumbles over his words before admitting that they have. The reporter then asks if this means Ian Malcolm's stories about the events on Isla Nublar are true, and Hammond is forced to admit that they are. The reporter then asks if there will be a public apology to Malcolm for the smear campaign against him, and Hammond tries to deflect by talking about the dinosaurs. This scene raises a lot of questions, such as why InGen would suddenly reverse their policy of denying the existence of dinosaurs and open themselves up to legal ramifications. It also raises the question of why they would care about endangered species when they are willing to destroy an entire planet to keep a fugitive alien from escaping, as in the movie Lilo and Stitch. Speaking of Jurassic Park, let's talk about The Lost World. In this movie, Ian Malcolm is recruited by John Hammond to document the dinosaurs on Isla Sorna so that they can be set up as a protected nature preserve. However, InGen shows up and tries to take a bunch of dinosaurs off the island to put them on display in a new park in San Diego. This is the same company that has spent years denying the existence of dinosaurs and smearing the reputations of people like Malcolm who insist otherwise. It's unclear what InGen's plan was, as they seem to have no way of explaining their sudden reversal of policy. Another plot hole in The Lost World is the fact that the crew of the barge hauling the T-Rex to San Diego is killed, but there is no explanation as to what killed them. In an earlier draft of the script, it was explained that raptors had snuck onto the barge, but this scene was never shot or cut from the final version. This leaves a major plot hole that is never resolved. Moving on to a more recent movie, Looper. In this movie, Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a hitman who kills people sent back in time by a crime syndicate. One of his targets is his future self, played by Bruce Willis. JGL kills himself so that Willis won't kill the mother of a child who will grow up to become a powerful crime boss known as The Rainmaker. However, if JGL realizes that killing the mother is what causes the child to become The Rainmaker, wouldn't Willis realize that too and not kill her? This is a major plot hole that is never addressed. Finally, let's talk about Star Wars again, specifically The Force Awakens. There's a scene where Han Solo says, "Great, another big planet destroying thing we have to blow up." This is a self-aware nod to the fact that the plot of the movie is very similar to the original Star Wars, but it's also a bit of a cop-out. The movie could have done more to differentiate itself from the original, but instead it relies on self-aware humor to excuse its lack of originality. In conclusion, plot holes are a common problem in movies, and they can be frustrating for viewers who want a coherent story. However, they can also be an opportunity for creative solutions and fan theories. So the next time you come across a plot hole, don't get angry, get creative.
