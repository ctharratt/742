Hey there, my dude. I just wanted to chime in on a few things you mentioned. First off, I totally agree with you about Skype-ing with old friends. It's a great way to stay connected and not feel so alone, especially if you've moved away from your hometown or your friends have moved away. And let's be real, drinking alone can be a bit depressing. So, cheers to that! But, I gotta say, I'm a bit confused about your proposal behavior. Are you trying to get a reality show or something? Because that's how you get a shitty reality show. Just saying. And speaking of shitty things, can we talk about Internet Explorer and AOL? Like, seriously, when are people going to wake up and ban those things? They're like the cockroaches of the internet, they just won't die. And don't even get me started on full-auto knives. I mean, who needs that kind of weapon? It's just asking for trouble. And while we're on the topic of trouble, did you hear about those cops who lit up an entire city block? That's some serious loose cannon behavior. I mean, I know they have a range they can go to for free, but come on, guys. The Chief is going to be pissed. And speaking of pissed, have you ever had your $5 footlong not toasted? It's like, come on, Subway, get your act together. And don't even get me started on people who try to show off their intelligence. It's like watching an /r/iamverysmart link play out in person. Cringe-worthy. But let's switch gears for a second and talk about something a bit more serious. The recent terrorist attacks have really shaken up the world, and I think it's important to remember that no one is defending the terrorists. In fact, quite the opposite. People are pissed because evidence that could have been useful in taking down potential terrorist networks may have been compromised or stolen as souvenirs. It's a scary thought, and it just goes to show how important it is to stay vigilant and aware of our surroundings. And on a lighter note, have you seen that video of the guy who looks like he's high and forgot why he stood up? It's hilarious. And speaking of hilarious, have you seen that Illuminati orgy scene from Eyes Wide Shut? It's like something out of a fever dream. And let's not forget about the top 5 magicians of all time. Who would make your list? Personally, I think David Blaine is a bit overrated. But let's get back to the serious stuff for a second. The recent shooting in Las Vegas was a tragedy, and it's important to remember that guns are not toys. With 800 rounds a minute, a 50 caliber shell can do a lot of damage. It's a scary thought, and it just goes to show how important it is to have responsible gun laws in place. And speaking of responsibility, can we talk about that guy who beat up his girlfriend like a tiger? That's some messed up stuff. And don't even get me started on the KKK guy who just looked over, shook his head, and kept on walking. It's like, really dude? You're just going to let that kind of hate go unchecked? But let's end on a positive note. I love the idea of depositing things into a Wank Account and withdrawing later. It's like a savings account, but for your pleasure. And let's not forget about the joys of catching up with old friends over a few beers. It's a great way to stay connected and not feel so alone. So, cheers to that, my dude.
