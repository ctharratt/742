As I sit here, staring at the posters on my dorm room wall, I can't help but feel a sense of frustration. These posters, with their motivational slogans and cheesy quotes, are getting more and more stupid by the day. It's like they're trying to tell me that everything is for everyone, which is patently false. Life is not that simple. It quite depends on what you mean by "excuses". A way to say pretty much the same thing, only better, is "don't lie to yourself or others". And I would add: "learn to accept defeat". That stuff must be very, very hard for some people to say. Oh wait... A pity, then. Your friends must frustrate you a lot, making a conscious choice to do something stupid on a regular basis. The problem with the view that success is solely based on hard work and good choices is that it says that it is somehow justified if you end up earning just about infinitely more than your buddies, because you "chose" right (or "worked hard" - which is the most popular justification). It is the value system that allows successful people to take pride in their success - even though the ultimate means by which they achieved that success (good genes, good parenting, good schooling, good experiences, good health, good luck and so on) was handed to them outright. It is the value system that, presumably, makes losers and poor people feel the burden of their failures - even though their circumstances too are the result of coincidences and bad luck. I bet you're thinking something like "no, most people spending their time in a prison cell made bad choices", but that says nothing useful about the path that led them to become criminals. For me, it has always been impossible to hear the life story of what used to be called "unfortunates", and not feel incredibly privileged just to have good parents. I don't think I will be able to convince you, the distance is too great, but I do worry a lot about the adverse effect this focus on "choice" is having. More importantly: It's just not true that we are free to choose our own way in life. The American dream is a lie. I'm honestly not trying to put you down or anything, but you should read some psychology (or behavioral economics) on this topic. See how much conscious choosing we do according to our best science. Maybe that will put a dent in your certainty. The ability to do what? If you mean free will, then that's a separate issue, I think. What I'm saying is a bit more philosophical: Saying that your wasted friends have the "ability" to study like you is correct only in the sense that the laws of physics allow them to do it. Saying that they could do it if they only wanted is the same as saying that they could do it if they were different persons - which is the same as saying that they can't do it. We're not talking about a different universe, we're stuck in this one, and here your friends are stuck (for the moment) being wasted and useless. They didn't choose to be like this. Quine put it eloquently (I didn't look up the exact quote): "I believe we have free will in the sense that we can do as we will. I do not believe we have free will in the sense that we can will as we will". I'm not sure if Quine realized it himself, but this is in effect claiming that we do not do as we will. You're right, I don't really think talent is a good word. But saying that your hard work is causing your success in college is like saying that pregnancy caused you to be born: Technically correct, but missing some important points. You should be proud of your hard work, indeed, though you shouldn't take credit for your own ability to make good choices. I'm not really saying that you do, but when I read statements like "I make a choice", I think "you felt like doing something". Coincidentally, and luckily for you, you are a person that has the ability (maybe "talent") to postpone gratification, think through the long term consequences of your decisions, and act upon your convictions. Don't for a second imagine that you chose to become such a person (in any meaningful sense of the word), or that your friends wouldn't - in their sober moments - want to be like you, if they knew how. Developing self-discipline takes motivation. Your argument, sir, is shaped like the family tree of King Charles II (that is, vaguely circular). The talent/hard work-dichotomy is bullshit, when you think about it. As if hard work is something you just "decide" to do, regardless of motivation. If you're motivated for hard work, it's not really hard work anymore, and if you're not, well, I'd say motivating oneself definitely is a "talent" - whatever that means. NO EXCUSES! IF YOU FAIL IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT! This is a common refrain that we hear all the time. But is it really true? Is it really that simple? Life is not that black and white. There are so many factors that contribute to our success or failure, and many of them are beyond our control. We live in a society that values success above all else. We are told that if we work hard and make the right choices, we can achieve anything we want. But the reality is that success is not solely based on hard work and good choices. There are so many other factors that come into play, such as luck, privilege, and circumstance. We need to stop blaming individuals for their failures and start looking at the bigger picture. We need to acknowledge that our society is not fair and that some people are starting from a disadvantage. We need to work towards creating a more equitable society where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. In conclusion, life is not that simple. Success is not solely based on hard work and good choices. We need to stop blaming individuals for their failures and start looking at the bigger picture. We need to work towards creating a more equitable society where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed.
