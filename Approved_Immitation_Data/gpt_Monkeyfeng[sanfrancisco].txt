Yup, this is the right way to do it. There’s been trolls, and there’s been supporters. Which side would you say is louder? What a shitty biased article. So you can't be against her because that just means you are trolling? Chinese American here too. This is so stupid. Why support him when he made a mistake? So what if he is Chinese? Batman will be arrested for having an assault claw gun in the city. A shit-fest with assholes on both sides. Had all of them except for Moonlight. Thanks! My bad, I looked it up from other sources that didn't specify it as pilsner but rather just American pale lager. Thanks for the info! True, but if you want to get very specific, Yuengling Premium is American Pale Lager not really Pilsner. Yuengling is great but I don't see them in the West Coast. Also, they are pale lager so they are not pilsner. I will look up Cellarmaker. Thanks. What would you recommend for local pilsner? Sorry, that's not what I meant to say. Depending on the pils, you can taste the hops aroma. However, it's not as pungent or overwhelming as IPA. It's a good beer with any food since it doesn't change the taste of your main food. But yes, they are lower on hops compared to IPA or Pale Ale. I didn't mean pils is low on hops. All I'm saying is that IPA these days are becoming generic with their taste profile. This. Pilsner is a lot harder to brew in my opinion. Many IPA brew is just stuffed with hops and weird flavor. It's easy to mask its failures. It's one of the best rated one even on sweethome: So hot in Oakland. I actually bought an AC on amazon yesterday.. I bet a lot of people are confused as to why there are guns in SF when there are no gun stores. Uber is probably the biggest bubble right now in the tech industry. Education and income level. That's how you solve issues like this in the long term. What libertarian crowd? WTF? SF has libertarians? Wow, I can't believe people fell for shit like this. I don't think she needed to add that bit of information though. Her priority right now is to make sure he is safe. I, however, just want to share this new piece of information since it could be the cause of his disappearance. This is why you don't shoot to injure someone. You always shoot to kill. You don't feel threatened because you are watching it on your computer of a video taken by a bystander who is yards away from him..... This. You would be surprised how difficult it is to shoot a pistol even if your target is 5 yards away. The irony is that politicians think hollow point is super dangerous and should be banned. Thanks for the information! I have always thought the homeless moved from other states and cities. I guess I am wrong on that. Good to know! They should have let Coldplay play their music. I mean 10 seconds of Yellow is an outrage. Just moved from Seattle where Pho shops are everywhere. Is there a large Vietnamese population in SF? I think Seattle area has a lot more southeast Asian population. Awesome! I'm excited to try this out. Thanks for hearing from the people of this sub. Lets make it better! And kick out techies and homeless people? Am I doing this right? I think Seattle is a much more relevant comparison. I think these are good changes. Now, is auto mod still auto blocking every question post? I never said you are a troll. But your account is one month old so for you to say SF subreddit was a disaster before just seems disingenuous. Yes, other smaller SF mods might not be for it as they might lose their subreddit. Well, they have equal right to say whatever is on their mind. Maybe I am. Maybe I am not. I just got several consecutive comments directed at me in the last 30 minutes posting about the same thing. I have been receiving comments for and against for the whole day now. It's usually at random. So 8 different users with against comment in the last 30 minutes? Hm... Of course it feels wrong. Plus, many of these accounts are only a few months old. Also, only one comment at a time, the rest goes silent. You're a redditor for one month and you are complaining about the disaster in the past... I'm sorry but how many accounts do you have on here? I have been receiving direct consecutive comments to me against posting question threads by 8 different reddit users in the last 40 minutes. The math doesn't work out here. I am suspecting someone is using multiple accounts to skew the debate... I don't think anyone wants stupid questions in any sub. You should read my post again. There is a reason why I don't answer much question in asksf because I can't. I just moved here. I have more questions and wish to have more participation and discussion so that's why I am suggesting this. This is why we are having this thread to discuss about it. I'm not the one deciding. I'm just bringing it up for people to comment on. Don't need to get personal over this. I am merely suggesting something that people might want for this subreddit. I don't have a lot of answer to give in asksf because I just moved here. In fact, I have a lot more questions than answers so this is why I am suggesting this. I think you should read my post again to understand my position. I went over to asksf and it's clear there isn't a lot of participation. There is no discussion going on. It's only being answered by people that patrols the subreddit. I think more participation from local SF in this subreddit is needed and that's why we should introduce questions back into this thread. I am new to this subreddit so I can't speak to that. I'm posting this because I spent a lot of time in Seattle and Shanghai subreddit were questions were allowed and it was a much better and friendlier atmosphere. And honestly, from the comments I have seen in this thread, I think most people disagree with you. Which is fine. This is what this discussion is about. Just remember downvote exists. Every subreddit in reddit have to deal with idiotic questions. Why are we the only few subreddits that have to separate questions into another subreddit. Are we so special that we can't deal with questions in this subreddit? I think most people here are saying they don't think it's working and that's why we are discussing allow questions back in the main sub. Allowing questions will bring more interesting and topical questions to the subreddit. How will it diminish it? People will downvote stupid questions. And talking about bridge pictures. What does that have to do with the question thread? Bridge pictures are still all over the subreddit. We live in the Bay Area... If you are sick of bridge pictures, you should move to Montana. Every city thread faces the same issue. The participation in this subreddit is already low enough. Why separate the subreddits into more subreddits? It makes no sense. San Francisco is a city that is known for its diversity, culture, and innovation. It is a city that has a lot to offer, from its beautiful landmarks to its vibrant nightlife. However, like any other city, San Francisco has its own set of problems that need to be addressed. One of the most pressing issues that the city is facing right now is the housing crisis. The cost of living in San Francisco is extremely high, and many people are struggling to find affordable housing. This has led to a rise in homelessness, which is a major problem in the city. Another issue that San Francisco is facing is the transportation problem. The city is known for its traffic congestion, and it can be difficult to get around the city during rush hour. The public transportation system is also not very efficient, and many people have to rely on their cars to get around. Despite these problems, San Francisco is still a great city to live in. It has a lot to offer, and there are many things to do and see in the city. However, in order to make the city a better place to live, we need to address these issues and come up with solutions that work for everyone. One of the ways that we can address the housing crisis in San Francisco is by building more affordable housing. This will help to provide more options for people who are struggling to find a place to live. We also need to work on improving the public transportation system in the city. This will help to reduce traffic congestion and make it easier for people to get around. Another way that we can make San Francisco a better place to live is by promoting education and income equality. This will help to reduce poverty and provide more opportunities for people to succeed. We also need to work on reducing crime in the city, which will help to make it a safer place to live. In addition to these issues, there is also a debate going on about whether or not questions should be allowed in the main San Francisco subreddit. Some people believe that questions should be allowed, while others believe that they should be kept in a separate subreddit. This is a topic that has been discussed at length, and there are valid arguments on both sides. Those who believe that questions should be allowed in the main subreddit argue that it will help to increase participation and discussion in the subreddit. They believe that it will make the subreddit more welcoming and friendly to newcomers, and that it will help to provide more opportunities for people to learn about the city. On the other hand, those who
