As a long-time Magic: The Gathering player, I have seen many different strategies and play styles come and go. But one thing that has remained constant is the importance of having a solid card base to build from. That's why I'm a big advocate of fat packs, especially for new players. For those who may not know, a fat pack is a bundle of Magic cards that includes a good storage box, a pair of deck boxes, a life counter, all the lands you'll need, and most importantly, a card base. From there, you can easily experiment with a few different play styles and move on to more serious deck building by getting specific cards. As a beginner, it's important not to worry about competitive play right away. Have some fun putting together your own play style, get comfortable with it, then go out and compete! But be warned, there are some cards out there that can make even the most experienced players shake their heads in frustration. Take Cavern of Souls, for example. This land card makes an already overpowered Standard tribe even better by making them uncounterable and even easier to cast. It's no wonder it's on the ban/restricted list. But even with cards like this out there, there are still plenty of ways to have fun and build a strong deck. One of my personal favorites is Deranged Outcast. This card may not be the most powerful, but it's hilarious to use. And speaking of powerful cards, Guardian of the Gateless is another one that I love to use. It's always satisfying to see your opponent's face when they realize they can't get past your defenses. But it's not just about individual cards. The art and animation in Magic: The Gathering is also a big part of what makes the game so enjoyable. I remember playing the Bant deck just to see the animation for Giltspire Avenger, which was by far the best. And the Innistrad block as a whole has some of the best art in all of Magic. Flavorful, cool, and quite often beautiful. Of course, building a strong deck is about more than just individual cards and art. It's also about strategy and knowing how to use your cards to their fullest potential. That's why I always recommend having a mix of different types of cards in your deck, from creatures to spells to enchantments. And when it comes to specific cards, there are a few that I always make sure to include in my decks. Thassa's Emissary, for example, is a great card that has helped me win many prerelease events. And I always save a space for it in my Daxos EDH deck. But it's not just about the cards you include in your deck. It's also about how you use them. I once had a deck that ran Ashnod's Altar with Havengul Lich, Ashes of the Fallen, and Rooftop Storm to generate infinite mana and Mind Grind my opponents to death. It was a lot of fun, but it also taught me the importance of knowing how to use your cards to their fullest potential. And speaking of EDH decks, there are a few commanders that I always make sure to include in my decks. Sheoldred, for example, is one of those cards that everyone hates to face because she's so powerful. But as a commander, that means she's always prevalent as a threat. Unless I'm playing a Kaalia or similar deck, I'm always going to stomp a Sheoldred deck as quickly as possible. But it's not just about the commanders you choose. It's also about the overall theme of your deck. For example, if you're going for a black deck, Gray Merchant of Asphodel is a great card to include. And if you're going for a blue deck, Thassa, God of the Sea is a must-have. Of course, building a strong deck is only part of the fun of Magic: The Gathering. The other part is playing against other players and seeing how your deck stacks up against theirs. And while there are some players out there who will try to take advantage of new players, there are also plenty of players who are willing to help out and give advice. That's why I always recommend finding a local game store and joining a Magic: The Gathering community. Not only will you be able to play against other players and improve your skills, but you'll also be able to make new friends and have fun. In the end, Magic: The Gathering is a game that is all about having fun and building strong decks. Whether you're a new player just starting out or an experienced player looking for a new challenge, there's always something new to discover and enjoy in this amazing game. So go out there, build your deck, and have some fun!
