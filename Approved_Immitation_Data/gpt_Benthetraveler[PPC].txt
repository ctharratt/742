So, you want to create a new PPC campaign? Well, it's not as simple as just creating an ad and targeting an audience. You need to have a clear understanding of your overall business goals and a budget to achieve them. This will help you determine the kind of ROI/CPA you want to achieve. Of course, whether or not your goals are realistic remains to be seen. But that's where careful planning and strategy come into play. Take a look at successful metasearchers like TripAdvisor, for example. Their conversion is a click out of their website, which costs nothing to the customer who is doing research. This is supposed to compete against hospitality conversions, where $100 is spent on hotel rooms. It may not seem fair, but it's the reality of the industry. That being said, there is no need to ever stop English language campaigns. There are enough expats out there to keep them going. However, it's important to pick your battles and bid only for targeted segments, offers, geographies, etc. This may be harder, but it's the best way to compete in a crowded market. With the recent changes to Google's SERP layout, it's important to consider how this will affect your PPC campaigns. While Priceline has always been on position 1, not much has changed for them. However, other companies may struggle with the reduced amount of positions and higher CPCs/lower CTRs. This may make bid management more complex, but Google's CPA bidding may become more attractive. When it comes to creating ads, it's important to focus on USP/CVR ads rather than CTR-driven ads. This will help you stand out from the competition and drive more conversions. However, it's important to remember that these changes may not have a significant impact on brand traffic unless you have a very generic brand name. As for bidding on keywords, it's important to remember that Google will pick the highest click cost from the choices when an overlap word occurs. However, it's always a good idea to check if you can do it better. It's also worth noting that the higher bid keywords may start getting the noise from the lower bid keywords due to their higher CTRs. When it comes to budgeting for PPC campaigns, it's important to remember that in-house at large companies, budget is never the issue as long as ROI/CPA targets are met. However, if your budget is tight, it's best to avoid strategic overspending. High bids may mean more clicks, but if your budget is limited, it's important to be strategic with your bidding. If you're considering expanding into the Chinese market, it's important to remember that it can be a tricky thing. Baidu is also three years behind Google, give or take. If you don't have a China-based office, it may be best to let them handle the initial setup. When it comes to creating a successful PPC campaign, it's important to remember that it's not just about the ads themselves. You also need to consider your landing pages, user experience, and overall strategy. It's also important to keep track of your metrics and adjust your campaigns accordingly. If you're looking to sell an e-book on PPC, it's important to remember that the market is already saturated with similar products. It may be best to focus on creating a unique offering that stands out from the competition. Overall, PPC can be a complex and challenging field, but with careful planning and strategy, it can also be incredibly rewarding. Whether you're a small startup or a large corporation, there are always ways to improve your PPC campaigns and drive more conversions.
