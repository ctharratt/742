Back in my day, things were different. Kids could take their back fat off without anyone saying anything. It was just a normal thing to do. But now, people are so sensitive about everything. They get offended by the smallest things. It's like they're looking for something to be upset about. And speaking of being upset, I don't understand why people are making such a big deal about some Muslims supporting Trump. Sure, most of them don't agree with him, but that doesn't mean we should ignore the ones who do. It's important to understand all perspectives, even if we don't agree with them. But let's be real, Trump is a racist. There's no denying that. And it's also racist to say that these Muslim men in any way affect the "Muslim community's view of Trump." They are just a small group of individuals who happen to support him. It doesn't change anything about Trump or the Muslim community as a whole. In fact, these men are clearly idiots for supporting such a bigot. It's like they don't even understand the harm that his policies and rhetoric can cause. And don't even get me started on the edited picture of the beautiful beasts in the woods. It's just a regular woods, not enchanted. It's pretty, but it's not magical. But speaking of magical, I can't help but feel conflicted about my ability to pull off a man bun/top knot. As a half-Japanese person, it's a hairstyle that's deeply rooted in my culture. But at the same time, I know that many people hate it and think it's a terrible hairstyle for white guys. It's frustrating because I want to embrace my cultural heritage, but I also don't want to be judged for my hairstyle. It's a silly thing to worry about, but it's something that's been on my mind lately. And while we're on the topic of cultural heritage, I can't help but wonder if ancient civilizations saw signs in nature that we don't understand today. Like, maybe the Egyptians saw a cat-shaped cloud and thought it was a sign from the gods. Who knows? But what I do know is that we should appreciate the beauty in nature, like the giant pile of salt or the tiny excavators. And if you ask God for no salt on your fries, maybe he'll remake the world without that pile. Speaking of remaking the world, I can't help but think about Ben Carson driving an electric smart car at 3 miles an hour. It's a funny image, but it also makes me wonder about the future of transportation and how we can make it more sustainable. But let's not forget about the importance of safety, like when standing on slimy algae-covered rocks. It's dangerous and we should be careful. And if we have a mental breakdown, maybe we should take a step back and realize that some of our breakdowns might look silly in hindsight. But let's not forget about the beauty in the world, like the doppelgangers of famous people in the animal kingdom. It's a reminder that even in the animal world, there's a sense of humor and playfulness. And while we're on the topic of animals, let's not forget about the importance of guinea pigs. They're used in science, as pets, and even to feed other pets. But this pig hasn't done enough and needs to do more. But let's not forget about the importance of politics, like the upcoming election. I wouldn't trust Hillary as a friend or business associate, let alone as president. And speaking of presidents, maybe Jay-Z owning Hillary Clinton's campaign and Beyonc√© becoming our next president isn't such a bad thing. But let's not forget about the importance of art, like the string drawing or the carving of dickbutt into a mountain. It's a reminder that anything can be art if we choose to see it that way. And let's not forget about the importance of hair, like the grizzly bear who has it and the person who loses it in a freak flame flower accident. It's a reminder to appreciate what we have while we have it. But let's not forget about the importance of safety, like not sticking our heads out of car windows. It's a reminder that accidents can happen and we should be careful. And let's not forget about the importance of love, like the love between two people who may or may not be good at oral. It's a reminder that love comes in all shapes and sizes. In the end, it's important to appreciate the beauty in the world, even if it's sometimes silly or strange. We should embrace our cultural heritage and understand different perspectives, even if we don't agree with them. And most importantly, we should be kind to ourselves and others, and always strive to make the world a better place.
