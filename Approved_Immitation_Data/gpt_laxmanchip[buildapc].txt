I recently came across a post on a forum where someone was asking about connecting around 100 phones to a PC just to charge them. I couldn't help but wonder why they would want to do that. It seemed illogical to me to try to plug that many devices into a PC if all they were trying to accomplish was a charger with no other device I/O requirements. I asked if they were also looking to copy data to/from the phones and that's why they were putting a PC in the middle. It's important to consider the purpose of the setup before deciding on the best way to achieve it. The person responded and thanked me for the feedback. They admitted that they hadn't thought about the purpose of the setup and were just trying to find a way to charge all the phones at once. They realized that it didn't make sense to use a PC for that purpose and decided to look into other options. While we're on the topic of PCs, I have a question for all the PC enthusiasts out there. Are liquid coolers much quieter than a 212 EVO that's running 2 fans? My PC seems very loud to me, even though I recently replaced all the fans with new Cooler Master SickleFlow 120s. I currently have an AMD FX 8350 OC'ed to 4.46GHz (retail is 4.0GHz) with a CM Hyper 212 EVO cooler. Are there any liquid coolers that would help me push a 4.6GHz OC, or is that too far? I'm looking to buy this case, and it has enough space to fit a NZXT Kraken x61, but I'm not sure if those are decent coolers or if a Corsair cooler (or something else) would be better. Thanks! I'm not an expert on liquid coolers, but from what I've heard, they can be quieter than air coolers. However, it's important to note that the noise level also depends on the type of fans you use. If you're using high-speed fans, they will be louder than low-speed fans. As for whether a liquid cooler can handle a 4.6GHz OC, it really depends on the specific cooler and the quality of your CPU. I would recommend doing some research on the different liquid coolers available and reading reviews from people who have used them with similar setups. Speaking of CPUs, have you heard of Skylake? It's the codename for Intel's sixth-generation Core processors. They are expected to be released in the second half of 2015 and will use a new socket called LGA 1151. Skylake CPUs are expected to offer better performance and power efficiency than their predecessors, so they might be worth considering if you're planning to upgrade your PC in the near future. On the topic of motherboards, I had a bad experience with an MSI board in the past. I had an MSI 760GM-P34 (FX) and it was very unreliable. 4/5 times, it wouldn't get past MSI logo (pre-BIOS) at boot. I would just have to hold down the power button, kill it, and retry. After about 5X, it would finally boot with no problems. I tried upgrading the BIOS, resetting the BIOS, etc, but no luck. My best guess was that it was a USB-related issue with the mobo, because I would have much better luck booting if no USB devices were plugged-in (except for kb). I ended up just never turning my PC off once I finally got it started. Ended up swapping out the mobo this past Christmas with a new ASUS mobo and haven't had any problems since. It's important to do your research and read reviews before buying a motherboard. Look for one that has good reviews and is known for being reliable. Don't just go for the cheapest option, as you might end up regretting it later. Speaking of upgrades, I bought an open-box PC from CyberPower PC 2.5 years ago for $750. The stock cooler worked like crap and my CPU would regularly sit over 80C at load until I replaced it with a 2-fan Hyper 212 EVO. I also needed to replace the mobo because it would regularly hang on a cold-boot and need to be manually power cycled 5+ times before it would finally boot all the way to the Windows login. In addition to the cooler and mobo, I also added a 240GB SSD for the OS and main apps to run on, a 4TB for backups, and swapped the GTX 660 for a Gigabyte GTX 970 G1 Gaming Edition. I now run a 4.3-4.55GHz OC with no issues. It's amazing how much of a difference a few upgrades can make. If you're looking to improve the performance of your PC, consider upgrading the CPU cooler, motherboard, and storage. You might be surprised at how much of a difference it can make. On the topic of CPUs again, I ran my AMD FX-8350 with a small stock cooler for over 2 years, assuming 88C was a safe/normal temp for an AMD CPU to run at under full load for hours on end when video editing/rendering. I now have a Hyper 212 EVO and my temps have never gone over 45C. :facepalm: It's important to monitor your CPU temps and make sure they're within safe limits. Running a CPU at high temps for extended periods of time can cause damage to the CPU and reduce its lifespan. If you're a gamer, you're probably interested in getting the best performance possible out of your PC. I play FPS games primarily and can play any new AAA title on the highest settings at 1080p and normally stay above 60FPS. I bought the Gigabyte GTX 970 G1 Gaming Edition and it's been fantastic. I can play every new AAA title on "Ultra" (max settings) at 1080p and still maintain >60FPS on average. Your PSU is on the weak side, however. I have a 650W and have had no problems, but I'm not sure if a 500W would be enough. It's important to choose a GPU that can handle the games you want to play at the settings you want to play them at. Look for a GPU with good reviews and a high clock speed. Don't just go for the cheapest option, as you might end up regretting it later. Finally, if you're building a new PC, make sure you install all the necessary software and drivers. Install Windows 8.1 Pro, any missing drivers, Chrome, Avast Antivirus (free), Open Hardware Monitor, Steam, Origin, Adobe CS6, Sony Vegas Pro 13, OBS, Hauppauge Capture, Gyazo, iTunes, Audacity, Microsoft Office 2013, and NVIDIA GeForce Experience. This will ensure that your PC is ready to go and you can start using it right away. In conclusion, when building or upgrading a PC, it's important to consider the purpose of the setup and choose components that will meet your needs. Do your research, read reviews, and don't just go for the cheapest option. With the right components and setup, you can get the best performance possible out of your PC.
