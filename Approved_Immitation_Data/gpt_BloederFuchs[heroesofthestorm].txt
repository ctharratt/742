Alright, let's talk about the state of Blizzard's communication with their player base. It's been a hot topic lately, with many players feeling frustrated and left in the dark about the development of their favorite games. And honestly, I can't blame them. Take Heroes of the Storm, for example. We've been waiting for a new hero for what feels like ages, and when we finally get a Q&A session with the developers, it's all about Kael'thas Sunstrider. Don't get me wrong, I'm excited for him too, but what about the promised increase in communication? What about addressing the core issues still plaguing the game? All we get is a vague post about matchmaking being "tricky" and "complicated". Thanks for the update on "it", Blizzard. Really helpful. And don't even get me started on the recent tournament. The organization was a mess, rules were changed mid-tournament, and to top it all off, it was behind a paywall on ESPN 3. As a European player, why would I even bother watching that? It's a shame, really, because I love watching competitive HotS, but Blizzard's handling of this tournament was just disappointing. But it's not just HotS. Diablo 3 players have been asking for basic chat customization tools for ages, and it's ridiculous that we have to keep asking for such a basic feature. And let's not forget about the negative reception D3 gets from some players. Personally, I think it's a great game, but it's clear that Blizzard needs to do a better job of communicating with their player base and addressing their concerns. And then there's Hearthstone. The recent introduction of Secret Paladin has caused quite a stir in the community, with many players feeling frustrated and helpless against the deck. And while Blizzard did introduce Kezan Mystic to counter secrets, it's not a very effective solution against Paladin secrets. It's frustrating to be told to just "figure out a new deck type" to counter a deck with no tools to do so. It's not fun having to play one specific deck just to counter an obnoxiously cancerous deck to win a somewhat decent number of games on ladder. What would be healthier for the game is if Blizzard provided us with other tools that could help us deal with secrets, so we don't see the same two decks over and over again. Secret Paladin has the best minions from turn 1 through 8 at their disposal, which you can't counter without introducing similar minions for other classes that challenge, say, a shielded minibot on turn 2. We're waiting for the technology to get there, but it's frustrating to feel like we're just being told to deal with it. And let's not forget about the lack of deck slots. It's a basic feature that players have been asking for since the game's release, and yet we still don't have it. It's frustrating to have to constantly delete and recreate decks just to try out new ideas. But it's not all bad. I do appreciate the recent post about the upcoming patch, even if it didn't tell us anything new. It's nice to know that Blizzard is working on improving the game, even if we don't know exactly what they're doing. And I do think that Blizzard has made some great changes to their games in the past, like the recent changes to matchmaking in HotS. But overall, I think Blizzard needs to do a better job of communicating with their player base. We want to know what's going on with our favorite games, and we want to feel like our concerns are being heard. It's frustrating to feel like we're just being brushed aside with vague posts about how "complicated" things are. We want concrete information and updates on the development of our favorite games. In conclusion, I think it's important for Blizzard to listen to their player base and address their concerns. We want to feel like we're being heard and that our feedback is being taken into account. It's frustrating to feel like we're just being left in the dark about the development of our favorite games. Blizzard, please do better.
