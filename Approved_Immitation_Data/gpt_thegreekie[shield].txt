The latest episode of Agents of SHIELD left me with so many thoughts and theories. First of all, can we talk about Ward? I know he's technically Yeerk!Ward now, but I'm still holding out hope that the original Ward's personality is strong enough to take over the monster at the end. I mean, he did say that the Yeerks didn't like change, so maybe Ward's personality is so strong that it can resist the Yeerk's control. But let's be real, Yeerk!Ward is still a threat. I bet he's going to kill Lincoln in the latter half of the season and leave Coulson's hand at the scene of the crime. Or maybe he'll leave it at the scene of a different crime when he murders one of the team members. I'm just relieved that no one on the team died in this episode. It was looking like Mack was going to be the one to go for a bit there. Remember when Coulson was super pissed at Hunter for messing up his mission? Well, Coulson's going to be even more pissed when he realizes that he messed up his own mission. And speaking of Coulson, I'm not sure how to feel about Ward's death. Should I be celebrating or grieving? I mean, I know he was a villain, but he was also a complex character with a lot of history. And can we talk about that portal? It's closing, and the team needs to hurry up if they want to get out of there. I have a feeling that next week is going to be a Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day for Coulson. And speaking of next week, did anyone else notice Budget Statham in this episode? When he was kind of winning the fight, I was mentally thinking, "Why don't those sticks have electricity? She could just jolt him right now." But I guess that's just a way to get around the Fox licensing rights. I have a theory about Rosalind. I think she's going to develop feelings for Coulson, but I also think that her cancer sob story was a total fabrication to get Coulson's sympathy. I mean, that's what Coulson was trying to look for in the first place, right? And can we talk about how Rosalind was totally honeypotting Coulson? That cancer sob story was just a ploy to tug at his heartstrings. Moving on to Andrew and May. I was really hoping that May was Lash, but it turns out that it was Andrew all along. And he's not just Lash, he's also a murderer. He most likely Lash'ed out and killed those other agents, which is why Von Strucker Jr was so freaked out. But I have a feeling that there's going to be a redemption storyline for Andrew. Maybe he'll sacrifice himself to save the team or something. And can we talk about Jemma and Will? I'm so glad that they're both alive, but I'm also worried about what's going to happen when they get back to Earth. I don't think that their relationship was necessarily romantic - it was more of a desperate times, comfort each other type deal. But I have a feeling that Will is going to make sure that Fitz knows how much Jemma talked about him while they were on the alien planet. Speaking of the alien planet, how did Jemma survive for months on that thing? I mean, what did she eat? And how did Will manage to stay alive for 14 years with just the remnants of the equipment from the NASA mission? It's all so implausible, but I guess that's just the magic of TV. Overall, this episode was a rollercoaster of emotions and theories. I'm excited to see where the rest of the season takes us, especially with the Civil War storyline looming on the horizon. I have a feeling that the team is going to fracture, and it's going to be heartbreaking to watch. But that's just the Whedon way, right? They always know how to tug at our heartstrings and make us cry. In conclusion, I'm still holding out hope for Ward's redemption, I'm worried about Andrew's future, and I'm curious to see how Jemma and Will's relationship will play out. And of course, I'm excited to see what Coulson and Rosalind's relationship will look like in the future. Will they become allies, or will they remain enemies? Only time will tell.
