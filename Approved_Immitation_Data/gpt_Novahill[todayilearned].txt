Hey there, let's delve into the origins of the words we use to describe gender and sexuality. The term "transgender" is often seen as odd or strange by many people, but it simply refers to individuals whose gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth. The "mo" at the end of the word is a reference to homosexuality, which is often associated with the transgender community. However, it's important to note that not all transgender individuals are gay or lesbian. I must say, I find it quite offensive that you referred to Bruce Jenner as a "queermo." It's not humorous in any way, shape, or form. It's derogatory and disrespectful to the transgender community. We should strive to be more accepting and understanding of those who are different from us, not mock them. Moving on, I completely agree with your statement that once someone is out, it's over. People should be allowed to live their lives as they see fit, without fear of judgment or discrimination. It's not up to strangers to decide someone's fate based on a brief encounter. Regarding the situation where someone grabbed your ass and you called them a dick, I don't think you should be charged with a crime. You have every right to defend yourself and stand up for what you believe in. It's not okay for someone to touch you without your consent, and you shouldn't have to tolerate it. However, I do think it's important to consider the ramifications of our actions. We should strive to be responsible and think ahead before we act. It's not just about us, but also about the impact our actions have on others. Moving on to the topic of violence, I must say that I disagree with your statement that "kill the weak or what gets in the way or the stupid because it's inferior and its survival can be seen as a waste of resources." Violence is never the answer. We should strive to be compassionate and understanding towards others, even if they are different from us. Regarding the issue of gender roles and societal constructs, I agree that we should encourage individuals to be their authentic selves and not conform to societal norms. It's important to embrace our uniqueness and celebrate our differences. We should strive to create a world where everyone is accepted and valued for who they are, regardless of their gender or sexuality. In conclusion, I think it's important to be mindful of the words we use and the impact they have on others. We should strive to be accepting and understanding of those who are different from us, and work towards creating a more compassionate and inclusive society. Violence is never the answer, and we should strive to be responsible and think ahead before we act. Let's embrace our uniqueness and celebrate our differences, and create a world where everyone is accepted and valued for who they are.
