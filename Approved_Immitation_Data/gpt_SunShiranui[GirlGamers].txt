I recently made the switch from a MacBook Pro to an Asus N550JK, and I have to say, I'm pretty happy with my decision. My MacBook Pro had a common issue that Apple refuses to acknowledge, and I was tired of dealing with it. Plus, the Asus N550JK is much more affordable and runs games really well, which is a big plus for me. I know I've already explained my view on this topic in this thread, but I'll say it again: I don't think it's worth having long discussions about the best way to communicate a message. We all have different views on this, and that's okay. The message I wrote was reasonably read as I suggested before, and other people in this thread reached the same conclusions. I don't think it's the reader's fault if they perceive it differently. That being said, I do think it's important to be careful when discussing sensitive topics like sexism and racism. It's not productive to make assumptions about the reader or to target specific groups of people. For example, a message like "Stop Racism" or "Stop Sexism" is a good message that doesn't make any assumptions about the reader. It's a generic message that can be applied to everyone. However, a message like "Take your white racist power fantasies somewhere else!" is a prejudiced statement that targets the reader specifically and accuses them of something (in this case, racism). I don't think this is the correct way to tackle social issues, and I would find it quite sad to see the discussion about gender equality become just two sides hurting each other. I believe that gender equality issues should be addressed with more empathy rather than by creating two opposite sides. We need to work together to find solutions that benefit everyone, not just one group or the other. Fighting sexism with sexism is not the right way to enact social change. On a lighter note, I recently played a simulation game called Long Live the Queen, and I really enjoyed it. It's a game where you have to manage your time and actions to be as ready as possible for life-threatening events that will happen to you. I haven't managed to finish it yet, but I highly recommend it. In terms of game development, I've dabbled in Objective-C and made a little app that made some money, but I didn't have much luck with game development using Cocos2D. However, when I picked game development back up, there were a lot of new cross-platform engines and frameworks that made my job easier. I also tried Ren'py for a bit but haven't finished any projects with it. I think interactive fiction and visual novels are an area that still hasn't been fully explored in game development. Most stories in games are fairly linear and don't take advantage of the interactivity that games are known for. There was an interesting experiment called Fa√ßade that I found really fascinating, but unfortunately, it doesn't run anymore on my OS. Coding can be difficult to digest, but I think the end result makes it worth it. Before starting CS at university, I was in a bit of a crisis because I love making games, but I worried about getting stuck doing something boring that wouldn't allow me to express myself creatively. In the end, watching Indie Game: The Movie and participating in a game jam like Ludum Dare convinced me to keep pursuing my dream by making my own path. The games I published for Ludum Dare were made using FlashPunk, which really helped me because it gets rid of most of the frustrating stuff. Right now, I've switched to HaxePunk, which allows cross-platform deployment. If you're thinking about participating in a game jam, my advice is to take it easy. If you get easily stressed, just know that it's fine if you can't complete your game in time. Even a failed project is a huge learning experience. Overall, I think it's important to approach sensitive topics with empathy and to work together to find solutions that benefit everyone. And when it comes to game development, don't be afraid to experiment and try new things. You never know what you might discover.
