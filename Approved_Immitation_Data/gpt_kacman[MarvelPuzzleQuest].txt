Hey there, fellow Marvel Puzzle Quest player! I've been playing for a while now and I wanted to share some tips and tricks that have helped me progress in the game. First off, let's talk about roster management. Roster Management It's important to manage your roster carefully, especially when you're just starting out. You want to make sure you have enough slots to roster all the characters you want, but you also don't want to waste precious hero points on slots you don't need. Here are some tips for managing your roster: 1. Keep all the 3 stars you can. They don't affect scaling too much and can have some nice damage. I know Gamora carried me through some of the early game. 2. Keep Juggernaut, he's one of the best. You can get rid of Venom for sure, and probably Hawkeye or Black Widow depending on how you use them. 3. When you first start, you're automatically put in easier brackets. Most people posting those scores looking for advice/alliances are probably new, so they're in the easier bracket. 4. Use the provided Ant-Man instead of yours, it has maxed powers. The key is his blue, every wave has a ton of special tiles and if you steal them the enemy is weak and you have tons of boosts. Bring OBW to use espionage to power Ant-Man's abilities. And then Thor or Wolverine to cover Green and Red. 5. Not OP, but I did it with Stormneto and Thor, stunned Deadpool so he didn't do his healing passive, and then lots of AP generation and board shaking with Storm green and Magneto red. 6. Either way, he is awful, so unless you want to keep him because he's rare now he's safe to drop for your waiting covers. 7. What to level: Daken+Wolverine/Ares+ Original Black Widow. I would go Wolverine since he's already leveled, but it's a matter of preference. Thor+Magneto+Storm. Also, you want to level evenly because your highest level affects enemy levels for events. For now, I would try to get your Wolverine Daken Black Widow team to the same level since Wolv is already so high, then level the next group evenly. 8. Keep: All 3 and 4 stars you can. 1 star Iron Man for DDQ. 9. Safe to get rid of: Bagman for sure. Moonstone, Human Torch, Ares if you choose Wolverine instead. Hawkeye and Cap are also safe to get rid of, but don't do it unless you have to for now because you've already invested covers in them. They probably will be dropped as everything else adds up. 10. Alliances: Check the forums on the sidebar, they're usually a better place for that. Lots of slots open before opening ten packs for sure. You aren't going to be able to recruit everyone you have yet. I would go for both 4s first if you can, they're much rarer. 11. You don't really have anyone I would recommend dropping unless there's any of your 2s you don't use much. Hold off on opening anything for now and just stock up on hero points and recruit what you can. Most people say never open tokens unless you have space. For me, I like opening single packs at least because half the point is getting new covers, and I have enough I'm more likely to get ones I already have than don't have. 12. For you, slow down as much as possible for now. Most of the 3*s you have are good ones so you don't want to have to get rid of any to roster others. Maybe try to have one or two open slots before you open a 10 pack? Event Strategies Now let's talk about event strategies. Events are a great way to earn rewards and progress in the game, but they can also be challenging. Here are some tips for tackling events: 1. If it's red when you go to fight someone, it's retaliation. It means they already beat you, and if you skip it doesn't count against you. 2. DDQ is probably the best way to get it, and then just luck with rewards. The current event seems pretty good for it with all the wave nodes giving multiple Iso rewards. 3. 4 is easier. I beat him once on four last time using Stormneto and Thor, and that was due to luck. Beat him three times in a row now and only lost due to bad luck on the last one. 4. I did it with Thor+Stormneto. Took down Jean first, then X, then Cyclops. I mainly went for blue and purple for Wind Storm, which basically kills X when boosted. Just make sure you use the purple to make owns of 4 and not match 5s or Jean will fuck you. 5. I think it's worth it. I only have Scarlet Witch, I just finished the second section and got 50 hero points, some recruit tokens and ISO. I'm about to start the last one, and if you have Quicksilver too you can get even more. Plus it's fun to do something different like you said, so might as well have fun. Final Thoughts In conclusion, Marvel Puzzle Quest is a fun and challenging game that requires careful roster management and event strategies. By following these tips and tricks, you can progress in the game and earn rewards. Remember to keep all the 3 stars you can, use the provided Ant-Man, and level your characters evenly. Good luck and have fun!
