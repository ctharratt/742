Hey guys, it's me, your favorite weed stock enthusiast. I've been keeping a close eye on the market and I have to say, things are looking up! We had a bit of a slump in April, but it seems like we're bouncing back. The House of Representatives has already passed some legislation in our favor, so if we can get a win in the Senate, that would be huge news! I know there's been a lot of fear and uncertainty surrounding the SEC suspensions, but I think we need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. The SEC is starting to look like the boy who cried wolf. Sure, there may be some bumps in the road, but this cycle will continue as more and more investors jump on board the pot train. Personally, I've learned my lesson from panic selling back in November. I watched as the stocks I sold came right back and soared higher. Now, I'm down 28% overall, but I'm not selling anything. I'm just hanging onto my shit and waiting for it to come back. And I have a feeling it will. One thing that's really exciting is the news that Washington State will begin selling recreational marijuana this June. That's right, folks, we're making progress! The state has been working hard to build a system to track cannabis from seed to sale, and they're finally ready to start issuing licenses. This is a huge step forward for the industry, and I think we'll see some green much sooner than June. Of course, there are still some concerns about federal law and the potential for prosecution. But let's not forget that medical marijuana has been legal in Washington since 2011, and that hasn't stopped the industry from growing. I think we need to focus on the positive and keep pushing forward. Now, let's talk about some specific stocks. AVNE was the first "weed stock" I know of to be halted, followed by PTOG and CANN. But they've all resumed trading now, and I think we can capitalize on this pattern. Keep an eye on those charts and look for buying opportunities when the stocks drop dramatically. And speaking of buying opportunities, I recently picked up more ERBB. I think this is a great time to invest, especially if you're willing to hold on through the tough times. Remember, you didn't lose because it went down. You lost because you sold. I've also been wondering about the findings of any investigations into wrongdoing. Is there a place where this information is posted? And have any other weed stocks been halted? These are important questions to consider as we navigate this ever-changing market. Finally, I want to give a shoutout to /u/WhyWeTrance. He was a great contributor to this sub, and I hope he comes back soon. In the meantime, I'll do my best to fill his big shoes. So there you have it, folks. Keep hanging in there, keep buying, and keep chillin'. We're making progress, and I have a feeling the future is looking bright for the weed stock industry. Don't get high until after trading hours, and as always, happy investing!
