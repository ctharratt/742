Do you ever have a roommate that just doesn't seem to understand how to function in the real world? I sure did. Let me tell you about my college roommate, Kevin. Kevin was assigned to me randomly during our freshman year at a medium-sized private university. At first, I thought he was just a little weird, but as time went on, it became clear that he had some sort of mental handicap that made it difficult for him to understand basic things like personal space, hygiene, and cleaning. One of the first things I noticed about Kevin was his complete lack of spacial awareness. He just didn't seem to understand how things physically worked. For example, after chewing gum, he would leave the wad of gum sitting on his desk to dry up. One time, he was making popcorn and somehow got gum stuck to the bottom of the popcorn package. He proceeded to microwave the gum with the popcorn, take the popcorn out and eat it while gaming on the other side of the room, not noticing the seven-foot-long string of gum from his gaming spot to the microwave. Another time, he fell asleep in his lofted bed and dropped an entire open box of Cheerios on the floor, spilling everywhere. When I asked him to clean up, he did his very best to do it, but only got about 60% of the cereal, leaving all the stuff that got behind desks and drawers, under the carpet, etc., and all the crumbs, for me to clean up. AFTER HE VACUUMED. Again, he's not lazy or refusing to clean well, he simply doesn't understand how to. It's scary how a 19-year-old doesn't know how to clean a simple mess. The way he eats food so sloppily and doesn't notice causes him to always have some sort of food on his chin, for hours at a time before I point it out. No spacial awareness or sense of cleanliness. Kevin also had almost no social life. He spent most of his time gaming and surfing YouTube. His choice for videos was limited to potty/sexual humor or gaming walk-throughs. His other hobbies included Magic: The Gathering (his most social hobby, most guys on our floor play, myself included), and watching my movies and TV shows. He never left the room except for classes, which he frequently skipped to sleep in after staying up until 5 am gaming. He constantly called himself a "troll," using that as an excuse to make humor out of sensitive subjects and be bad at things. That sounds irrelevant, but it totally isn't. His eating habits were terrible. He ordered Domino's pizza about 5 times a week, usually buying some sort of 3-for-low-price deal so he could leave the rest in the fridge for later (which he never covered up or anything). I told him many times that this was a waste of the money his parents gave him (he had no job but spent like a bitch), and was extremely unhealthy when added to his other diet of hamburgers and waffles. One time, he stayed up very late gaming and eating through about 2 whole pizzas, a bag of fun-size Twix, and most of a 2-liter bottle of coke. I woke up to him sprawled across my futon looking awful. He woke up and informed me that he puked late the night before, so I kicked him off the futon (we can't wash that. He got into his bed to sleep some more), got wipes and disinfected everything (I hate puke), and headed to my 8 am. He must've gone to his too, because I got back to find him gone, and his puke all over his bed and the surrounding wall. He just left for class without cleaning it up or telling anyone. I had a sort of mental breakdown (I hate puke), and called my mom asking how I should handle the situation because I knew Kevin could not thoroughly clean up after himself, and I wouldn't be able to clean it up without puking myself. She gave me the advice to contact his parents among other things, and we hung up just before Kevin got back from his class, WITH PUKE STILL CRUSTED UP ON HIS CHIN AND SHIRT. I promptly made him take off all his clothes and leave them in the hallway, fold up his covers and put them in a garbage bag with the clothes, put his laptop, chargers, and textbooks in another bag (he got puke on those too), and take a shower. While he showered, I snuck onto his phone to get his Dad's number and called him to inform him of the situation, all of which he responded to in this sad, defeated tone that essentially said "sounds like Kevin" that made me really feel for the guy. (His family is actually so nice.) He immediately drove an hour to school to help Kevin wash everything and get himself taken care of. I over-sanitized the room and vented to my girlfriend about the situation that night. It was a rough day. Later we talked about it - turns out then when he woke up that morning, in his puke and all on his bed, HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE HAD PUKED. He simply didn't notice it there, and it was a surprise to him when he got back to the room after class. He always slept in the clothes he wanted to wear the next day (usually just the same clothes from the previous day), so his habit made him unaware of his own cleanliness when he woke up. Again, spacial awareness. Living with Kevin was a challenge, to say the least. But I have to admit, he was pretty damn good with a trackpad by the end of the year. He's out of my life now, it's up to his parents and future peers at this point. But I think he'll be okay, in the end. I have to admit, though, I have stories that'll make him harder to believe. But he's definitely real.
