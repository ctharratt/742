When I first met my significant other, he used to sleep with the TV on. I couldn't handle it. The constant noise and flickering lights kept me up all night. But I didn't want to start our relationship with a fight, so I compromised with him. Instead, we started sleeping with music playing. He actually adjusted really fast. Now we don't sleep with anything on besides a fan. And the fan is only on because of me. But that's not the only compromise I've had to make in my life. When my daughter was born, her birth father was in her life for a while. We were together for the first 2 1/2 years of her life, then he and his now ex-girlfriend got custody for a year. It turned out disastrous. His girlfriend beat her, and they kept her from even speaking to me for the entire year. Finally, when they split up, he threw in the towel, and I was able to get custody back after a long year of heartache and fighting for her. We lived with my ex-boyfriend for about 9 months. He was horrible to both of us. Like... horrible. Anytime we were in public, people would refer to him as her dad. She would immediately stop them and say "No. He is not my dad." Every time. Finally, we got away from him and had a while of just "us" time. Her father hasn't been in her life since I got her back, almost 4 years ago. Eventually, I met my current boyfriend. He's absolutely amazing, and we both love him like crazy. My daughter asked me a couple of months ago if I thought he'd let her call him daddy. And even though her real dad is a complete fuckbag, she would always make sure people knew he was her dad. Nobody else. So when she asked me that... I didn't even know what to say. I guess I was shocked. But it was a happy shocked. It made me extremely happy to know that she loved and trusted this man enough to want to call him dad. So eventually, I told him she'd been asking me if she could call him that. He was perfectly okay with it. And she's been calling him daddy ever since. But not everything in life is about compromises and happy moments. Sometimes, people can be ridiculous. For example, some people get upset when dogs cling to me. I'm not a dog person, so it's definitely not something I try to make happen. I think they just like the way certain people smell. But some people get so upset about it and tell me to grow up and get over it. Would they rather the dog hated me? It's not like I'm laying out bait for her. It's out of my control. But that's nothing compared to the struggles some people face. For example, whether you enabled her or not, she was going to do the drugs regardless. Trust me on that. It's not your fault at all. It sounds like if her ex was willing to give her the time of day, presented her with the opportunity to sleep with him in exchange for coke, she'd jump on it in a heartbeat. Literally and figuratively. She's walking all over you, and she knows you're not going to do anything about it. People like this are impossible. You really should leave her. Or at the very least, leave for a few days to make her see that you're serious about not putting up with it. If it doesn't faze her, try your best to move on. Seriously. And if you have children with someone like that, it can be even more difficult. The courts can absolutely grant a parenting agreement/custody agreement stating that (at the very least) your children shall not be left alone in Jenny's care. I had it court-ordered that when my daughter went to visit my ex-husband, his girlfriend could not be around. It made him stop spending time with our daughter though because, you know, disposable bitches are way more important than your own flesh and blood. But that's besides the point. I'd file a motion with the court and then explain to the judge why you don't feel comfortable with your children being around this person. They'll listen to you, and you'll most likely get it granted. It sounds like somebody needs to make a call to DCF about this chick though. Seriously. She's blatantly neglecting her own kids, nevermind yours too. And if you're dealing with a toxic family member, you need to tell that asshole that he will have absolutely no relationship with his granddaughter until he can PROVE TO YOU that he can treat you with complete respect. Your baby doesn't need to be around anybody who treats her mother that way. You don't need to cut him off entirely, but tell him he won't be granted a relationship with her until he starts treating YOU the way you should be treated. But sometimes, even when you think you know someone, they can surprise you. I went through this with an ex-boyfriend. We ended up having to move in together fairly quickly (long story, but it wasn't planned)... all seemed fine. I'd heard rumors about him saying he was abusive, been known to hit his girlfriends, very violent with major anger issues, the whole 9 yards. But I never saw that in him. Not once. He was always really sweet to me, seemed to absolutely adore me, so I just took it with a grain of salt. But I'd heard it from multiple people at this point. Still, I couldn't see him being that person. So I ignored it. One night after work, my boss came to tell me before I left that there was a man in the bar of our restaurant that "urgently needed to speak with me." I didn't know who this guy was. But it was at my work, so I went to see what he wanted. He told me Sean (my ex) and his ex-girlfriend used to live with him, and he had to call the police 4 times on him because he was attacking his girlfriend. Beating the shit out of her. This scared me. Why would this random 40-year-old dude lie to me about this? He doesn't know me from a hole in the wall. He told me if I left Sean that he'd drive me back to the state I was from, the place I lived before I had to abruptly move in with Sean. But I told him no, I wanted to go home and talk to my bf first. So he gave me his number and told me to call if I needed help. I get a ride home, I arrive a half-hour later than I normally get home; the house is pitch black and reeks of booze. I find Sean sitting in the darkness in the living room, playing a guitar with only 3 strings. "Where the fuck were you, you fuckin slut?". .. that's the hello I got. He'd NEVER talked to me like that before. He was shitfaced. I told him not to talk to me like that and told him someone needed to talk to me after work. He got up and immediately threw me into the wall, holding my shoulders and repeatedly slamming against the wall, demanding I tell him who it was. So I yelled "it was fucking Shane! Warning me that you were like this!" He proceeds to tell me I was out fucking this 40-year-old guy... I was only 18. So uhh.. no. He kept throwing me around, I grabbed the (unfortunately corded) phone to call the girl who brought me home and ask her to come back to get me... he took a knife and cut the phone cord in half. I had no phone. He kept shoving me, spitting in my face, every shitty thing you can think of... for 12hrs straight. I couldn't go anywhere, we lived in the middle of nowhere in the woods pretty much, closest neighbor was 4 miles away.. finally at noon the next day the girl who dropped me off came back to bring me to work. It's important to remember that people can surprise you, for better or for worse. But it's also important to stand up for yourself and your loved ones, even if it means making compromises or difficult decisions. Life is full of ups and downs, but it's how we handle them that defines us.
