Well, let me tell you, 2016 was a rough year for the Orioles. We had high hopes, but it all came crashing down when some punk kid robbed us of a win by reaching over the wall. It was a devastating blow, and that's why I included 1997 in my assessment, even though we did make it to the playoffs that year. But let's talk about the real issue at hand: Dexter Fowler. I think he made a huge mistake by not accepting his qualifying offer from the Cubs and instead trying to test the free agent market. His performance dipped last year, and he had a chance to accept more money from the Cubs to remodel himself. Now he's essentially doing that, but it came at half the salary. If you're Dex and you somehow displease the O's front office, what if it doesn't work out for him? Dex has now soiled his reputation by going along with the media's fantasies, and now it's come to a head. He now has to backpedal and tell a bunch of pissed off Baltimorans and an entire nation what "really" happened. How many people do you think will believe him? I don't know if we will get much more out of this story because a deal, somewhere, has been reached with Dex. He would have still found work, he isn't an all-star, but he has his positives. Think about it. He denies signing with the O's. Now they wonder if he really wants to come here. Well, a lot of the media, based on the current info present, is still placing the blame on Fowler. I watched MLB all day today, and nobody thought he handled the whole thing well. Personally, I would much rather bring some truth to the media circus and how the team who wants to sign me reacts to that, but that's not my problem. Front offices interpret things, just like the media. At the end of the day, Fowler has still been seen as the villain. Like I said, we got a hungry Rule 5 OF that just had a door flung open. Sometimes, a chance to prove yourself is what pushes you over the top. If I were Fowler, I would have read the reports and would have tried to make my case BEFORE I finalized with the Cubs. I would have been like, "yo, this ain't true." Yes, but the truest survived. Talk to Yankee fans. I know it will be hard to do that, but I'm sure they wanted the Curse of the Bambino extended (the Sox had to topple the Yanks to end the curse). They may have insight. I know, but someone told me life is perspective. I have absorbed myself in that philosophy. Like Brett Favre when he "retired" the first time. What Fowler did was a gut punch, and he can rot in baseball hell. My two cents are that the Cubs are a legit World Series contender. They have 95% of what they need to succeed. The Orioles, though rolling with some HUGE momentum with successful signing after successful signing, are still a team with a lot of "maybes." Fowler wanted to ultimately stick with a team that would, more than likely, take him to October. We signed a Rule 5 pick who is hungry, producing impressive stats in the minors, and just had his own door open wide through a dick move. Cheaper than Fowler, then have him leave us at the last minute. Fowler wanted an opt-out. Orioles didn't want to give him one. Fowler took that as his window to leave. I'm watching MLB right now. I hope what's his name makes the team. The Rule 5 guy from Tampa. Don't tell me what his name is; it'll come to me. Always an exception or two. But we've played well against Archer, knock on wood. I still would like a #1, not 3s and 4s, but luckily the rest of our division has average starters. After all this, we should have signed Chen. In two years, we will be making a very similar move to this. An option means he is still ours, right? Sorry, some of the businessy terms escape me. After Googling, does this mean in year 3, Gallardo will be ours, but we can start him out in AAA if we deem necessary? I'd tend to think the same, but the guy in the FO thought otherwise. Nobody else had answered the call. I think signing Gallardo was trading Chen for almost another Chen, just there was no way in hell we'd sign Chen for the years or money. Fowler needs an asterisk next to him until I see a headline. How about a Bohnut? A doughnut with Boh beer in it? I spent the night at his place. Should have assumed what "going out for drinks" really entailed. Was not prepared with what I packed. Now THAT sucks. I only went to 2 or 3 games last season and was too poor to get beer. I drank before the game. Well, it would hurt my feelings even more if the beer was still brewed at its original spot. It isn't, but that was still startling news. Will the Boh's still be half-priced if you come in an hour early? I used to come in an hour early and buy two, and then just down them. Yeah, that one is nice, but Manny's capped off a sexy comeback. Jumping the gun a bit, haha. Or just confident? We have the Duke of the one-year deal. Who is the guy in black that's pitching? Someone ate their Wheaties. As has been said 10,000 times on this sub, if there is one thing we need to clean up, it is our minor league coaching staff. Complete overhaul of our staff and philosophy. We can't develop talent, we need coaches who do something else other than what we do now. We keep the pick, use it, and then what? We see in 4 or 5 years another glorious product of shoddy coaching/philosophy. If I had to put a flavor on this logic, it would be steak flavored. Dan Duquette is the Ash Ketchem of baseball. Just think about it. You're paying for Machado's extension. Ticket prices increased last year, we extend JJ. They increase this year, we extend Crush. They go up again next year, we extend Manny??? Yeah, I kinda just wanted to wear my Hawaiian O's shirt into enemy territory lol. I have heard good things about Citi. I was thinking of seeing the O's play the Yankees. Bus it. Holy shit, you have G'knight on draft???? I can only find it in 16oz cans. You know. I'll eventually get up there. How close are you to the Yankees ballpark? Three Phils is my jam. Do you have Ommegang? They are a NY craft brewing co. Thanks for finally seeing I was just goofing. I was afraid I gambled and lost. I'll tip well. Nor am I Ken Rosenthal, but thanks! Sounds like something he would say, cuz I do get to watch MLB Network all day long, so I feel I have some validity. Not this again. Ken Rosenthal of MLB Network did a whole conversation on this. You see one pair of titties, of course, you wanna know what the rest look like. Toronto has the entire country funding it. Los Angeles is big, too. Good thing I pulled out. Yeah, some of the piles on the corners of intersections are massive. You're making blind turns. You're right. Well, Duke won't give up that draft pick. He has too much faith in our farm system, which has a BRILLIANT track record with SP development. I just have a bad habit of thinking every signing that we make isn't good enough. But can you blame me? Three of the biggest markets in the game are in our division. 2.5 hours of my day yesterday was dedicated to digging. My neighborhood's fine, but as my mom told me, the rest of the roads are very 50/50. She drove to work this AM and said "still shaky." We got 35 inches. Our new Korean friend is too big an uncertainty for me to consider him a lockdown. I don't know if I would call three necessary additions "so close." That's 1/3 of the team. And judging by what's left and what Duquette's ideologies are. In conclusion, the Orioles had a rough year in 2016, and the Dexter Fowler situation didn't help matters. But we have a hungry Rule 5 OF who just had a door flung open, and sometimes, a chance to prove yourself is what pushes you over the top. We need to clean up our minor league coaching staff and philosophy to develop talent better. And Dan Duquette is the Ash Ketchem of baseball.
