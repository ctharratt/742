Ah, the joys of being the single friend in a group of couples. It's like being the odd one out, the third wheel, the fifth Beatle. You're there, but you're not really there. You're included, but you're not really included. It's a strange feeling, isn't it? I mean, don't get me wrong, I love my friends and I love their boyfriends. They're all great guys, really. But sometimes, it's just hard to be around them when they're all coupled up and I'm the only one flying solo. It's like they have their own little world, their own little language, and I'm just on the outside looking in. And it's not like I'm jealous or anything. I'm genuinely happy for my friends and their relationships. I just wish I could be a part of it all, you know? I wish I could have someone to share all these experiences with, someone to hold hands with, someone to cuddle with on the couch while we watch movies. But alas, I am single. And that's okay. I mean, I'm only in college, right? I have my whole life ahead of me to find someone. But for now, I just have to deal with being the single friend. And it's not just the fact that they're all coupled up that makes it hard. It's also the fact that they make plans without me sometimes. Like, I'll be hanging out with them and they'll get a text from one of their boyfriends asking if they want to do something, and suddenly I'm left out in the cold. It's not their fault, I know that. But it still stings a little. And then there's the fact that they're always doing couple-y things. Like, they'll be holding hands or cuddling or kissing, and I'm just sitting there like, "Uh, can we talk about something else please?" It's not that I'm uncomfortable with PDA or anything, it's just that it's a constant reminder that I'm the only one without a significant other. But I don't want to be a downer or anything. I still love hanging out with my friends, even if it does make me feel a little left out sometimes. And I know they love me too, even if they don't always realize how their actions might make me feel. I guess what I'm trying to say is that being the single friend in a group of couples is hard. It's a weird dynamic that takes some getting used to. But at the end of the day, I wouldn't trade my friends for anything. They're my people, you know? And even if I'm not a part of their little couple-y world, I'm still a part of their world. And that's all that really matters.
