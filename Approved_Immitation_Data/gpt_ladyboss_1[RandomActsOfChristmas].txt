Hey there, everyone! I hope you're all doing well and enjoying the holiday season. I just wanted to take a moment to update you all on my situation and express my gratitude for all the support and kindness I've received from this community. First off, I want to thank the mods for clearing up any misunderstandings and for all the hard work they've been doing to make sure every child gets a gift this Christmas. I know it's not an easy task, and I appreciate all the effort they've put in. As for my own situation, I've been updating my request with any offers, contest wins, and gifts that have been given to me. I still have some updates to do tonight, but unfortunately, I can't do them from my phone. I also want to mention that there are still some offers and contest items that haven't arrived yet, but were counted in my gifts. I'm keeping track of everything and will update as soon as they arrive. I also want to take a moment to express my hopes for the new year. With a new year quickly approaching, I'm hoping for new ways and brighter days. I'm hoping to move from illness to health, from negativity to truth, love, and positivity. I'm hoping to move from despair to hope, from fear to trust. I'm hoping to move from hate to love, from war to peace. I'm hoping that peace and love will fill my heart, my world, and my universe. Amen. I also want to send a special message to /u/Juliana59. I hope your upcoming trip is easy, quick, and safe, and I hope your healing is quick, easy, and 100% complete. Cyber hug, my friend. If you ever need a prayer or positive affirmation, just ask. Stay strong and take it easy. Nutrition is an important part of making a full recovery, and it's also good to have a strong and positive support system. Webmd also has some really good info if you need it. Now, I do have a question for the mods. Is there a problem with my request? If so, could you please let me know if I've done something wrong? One minute I'm flaired and approved, and the next I'm not. Without being told why, it doesn't seem very fair or unbiased. It doesn't seem politically correct either. Moving on, I want to thank everyone who has offered gifts and support. Your generosity is truly amazing, and I'm grateful for every single one of you. I also want to mention that my son Tay got a camera for Christmas and could use an SD card and some batteries. He has both on his wishlist, and I'll link them here. I've also updated my request with all the details. I have two teen girls, one that's grown, and a grandma. Any of my girls would appreciate your generous offers. Have an awesome holiday and new year, everyone. Now, I do want to address some issues that have come up recently. I know there have been some problems with contest items not arriving on time or not arriving at all. I think it's important to handle these situations with grace and understanding. It's not always easy to get everything right, and sometimes things just don't work out the way we want them to. That being said, I do think there are some things that could be done differently in the future. For example, maybe the contests should happen earlier if they need so much time for shipping. Maybe the sponsors should send the items to the mods (the ones that are not personalized) and then let the mods give them out. This would ensure that everything is accounted for and that every child gets a gift. I also want to mention that it's important to follow through on promises. I know that everyone here wants to help, but it's important to make sure that the help actually gets to the people who need it. If an item is promised, it should be delivered. If it's not going to arrive on time, it's important to let the recipient know as soon as possible. I've been keeping track of everything that's been promised to me, and I've been updating my request accordingly. I've posted everything that was won, everything that was promised, and everything that has arrived. I've listed the individual items so that Santa's can decide if the item is shared, should count as an individual item, or whatever. I'm not trying to double dip or get more than I should. I just want to make sure that everything is accounted for and that every child gets a gift. Unfortunately, there are still some items that haven't arrived yet. Tay has one gift that I know for sure is coming, and that's a camera that was gifted to him by JamesonsMommy. The t-shirt that was won in a contest was supposed to be a 10/12 large, but it's actually for a kid and won't fit Tay. The socks and necklace that were won over 20 days ago still haven't arrived, and I have little faith that they will arrive in time for Christmas. I'm not trying to be difficult or ungrateful. I'm just trying to make sure that everything is accounted for and that every child gets a gift. If anyone wants a detailed list of exactly what was won, promised, and received for each kid, I'm happy to provide it. I just want to make sure that everything is fair and that everyone gets what they deserve. In conclusion, I want to thank everyone for their kindness and generosity. I hope you all have an awesome holiday and new year, and I hope that 2022 brings us all peace, love, and happiness. Thank you for being a part of this amazing community, and thank you for all the support you've given me.
