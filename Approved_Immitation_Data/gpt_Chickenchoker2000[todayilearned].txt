You know, it's funny how much we take for granted when it comes to ethnicity and tribe. We assume that they're one and the same, but that's not always the case. Take Rwanda, for example. The Tutsi and Hutu designations were originally based on who owned cattle and who farmed. It was a division of social castes, not necessarily ethnicity. Both groups spoke the same language, existed in the same lands, and had the same religion. But over time, those divisions became more entrenched, and eventually led to the horrific genocide that we all know about. It's interesting to think about what might have happened if Rwanda had been granted independence and had been able to start anew. Would they have discarded those arbitrary designations and created a more equitable society? Or would the divisions have persisted, regardless of the political system in place? It's hard to say, but it's worth considering. Of course, it's not just Rwanda where tribe plays a significant role. Across much of sub-Saharan Africa, tribe is still a major factor in how people identify themselves and interact with others. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it can lead to tensions and conflicts when one group feels marginalized or oppressed by another. And it's not just Africa, either. In many parts of the world, ethnicity and tribe are still major factors in how people identify themselves and interact with others. It's something that we need to be aware of, and something that we need to work to overcome. But it's not just about ethnicity and tribe. It's also about power and politics. In Rwanda, the majority Hutu came to power after independence, and that led to a sense of vengeance against the perceived oppression of the Tutsi. It's a pattern that we see all too often, where one group comes to power and seeks to marginalize or oppress another group. It's a sad reality, but it's one that we need to confront. We need to work to create more equitable societies, where everyone has a voice and everyone is treated with respect and dignity. It's not an easy task, but it's one that we must undertake if we want to create a better world for ourselves and for future generations. And speaking of creating a better world, it's always heartening to see someone who can bridge cultural divides and communicate effectively across different languages and cultures. I can only imagine how awesome it must be to watch someone speak fluent Mandarin or Putonghua, and still be coherent and articulate in their writing. It's a testament to the power of language and communication, and it's something that we should all strive for. Of course, not everyone is able to communicate effectively across different cultures and languages. In some cases, it's a matter of language barriers or cultural differences. In other cases, it's simply a matter of people not wanting to make the effort to understand others. I've experienced this firsthand in Hong Kong, where people often refuse to speak Cantonese or try to understand when I speak it. It's a difficult language, to be sure, but it's frustrating when people don't even make an effort to understand. But it's not just about language. It's also about cultural differences and the way that we perceive others. In some cases, people may have negative perceptions of others based on their ethnicity or tribe, and that can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts. It's something that we need to work to overcome, and it starts with understanding and empathy. We need to make an effort to understand others, to see things from their perspective, and to treat them with respect and dignity. It's not always easy, but it's essential if we want to create a better world for ourselves and for future generations. And speaking of creating a better world, it's always heartening to see people coming together and working towards a common goal. Whether it's fighting for social justice, protecting the environment, or promoting peace and understanding, there are countless examples of people working together to make the world a better place. Of course, there are also plenty of examples of people working against each other, whether it's for power, profit, or simply out of fear and ignorance. It's a sad reality, but it's one that we need to confront if we want to create a better world. So let's work together, across cultures and languages, to create a better world for ourselves and for future generations. Let's strive for understanding, empathy, and respect, and let's work to overcome the divisions that separate us. It won't be easy, but it's a challenge that we must undertake if we want to create a better world.
