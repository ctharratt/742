Alright, let's talk about some controversial topics that have been on my mind lately. First off, let's put abortion to the side for now. I believe that states should have the right to decide on their own laws regarding abortion. But let's move on to Rand Paul's stances on gay marriage and drugs. They have been pretty in line with his father's, and I think that's a good thing. Rand is an unapologetic Christian, and he has been smeared because of it, even though it has little to do with his policy making or voting. If you agreed with his father on a lot of things, I think you'll find that Rand is pretty close. Now, let's talk about something that affects many Americans on a daily basis: tipping. Many servers make less than minimum wage per hour and are required to tip out huge portions of their total sales to supporting staff like bar backs, bussers, and hosts/hostesses. You should still tip in America, and tip well. They're working hard, and it's not their fault that the restaurant shifts the pay burden onto the customers. But what about the back of the house (BOH) staff, like the cooks? Once you cross the barrier from getting tips to not getting tips, your take-home pay is pathetic compared to the front of the house (FOH) staff and other BOH staff that get tips. Do cooks working in fine dining restaurants make more than some other cook working in some generic Mexican strip mall restaurant that doesn't get tips? Sure. But do they make anywhere close to the guy frying your chicken strips at the sports bar that gets a share of the bar tips? No. The justification for this pay discrepancy is that the cooks have the privilege of working at that level of restaurant and are learning. That's if they get paid at all. In states/countries where it's still legal, a lot of them are working for free as interns/commis/pick your term for the same reason, the privilege of learning that comes from working at that level. This is especially true at the Michelin star level. On the opposite end, a cook who works in fine dining can go work in a bar and get tips and make triple or quadruple what they do at their fine dining job. But they don't, because they want to become real chefs, and that requires an extraordinary amount of knowledge and commitment. The kicker is, those chefs often make far, far less than you might think. Pick a good, local restaurant in your standard big city. The executive chef there probably makes as much or less than most of the servers because of how enormous their tips are. 20% on a $40 average per cover adds up fast. If you're in an actual good restaurant and not a chain place like Olive Garden or Applebee's, the cooks are almost certainly not getting any of the tips you're giving to the server, and almost certainly make a pathetic hourly wage, as well as working tons of unpaid hours on top of it. No, they're not. Most of the cooks are working for free as interns or make jack shit hourly, and unless the "chefs" own the restaurant, they're making what would be considered an okay to a pretty good middle-class wage. The general rule is, the better the restaurant, the less the cooks make. Working in fine dining is impoverishing for the BOH. And it's not like it's going to change because of the competition for those jobs. It's half an hour a week, come on, they can do better. Now, let's talk about something that affects many Americans on a daily basis: healthcare. The United States is the only developed country in the world that does not have universal healthcare. This means that millions of Americans are uninsured or underinsured, and they are forced to pay exorbitant prices for medical care. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was a step in the right direction, but it did not go far enough. It was a compromise bill that was designed to appease both Democrats and Republicans, and it ended up being watered down to the point where it was not effective enough. We need a single-payer healthcare system in this country. This means that the government would be responsible for providing healthcare to all Americans, regardless of their income or employment status. This would eliminate the need for private insurance companies, which are a major source of the problem. The United States spends more on healthcare than any other country in the world, but we have worse outcomes. We have higher rates of infant mortality, lower life expectancy, and higher rates of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. This is unacceptable. We need to invest in preventative care, which will save money in the long run. We need to invest in public health initiatives, like clean water and air, which will prevent diseases from occurring in the first place. We need to invest in mental health care, which is often neglected in our current system. In conclusion, there are many issues facing our country today, and we need to address them head-on. We need to have honest conversations about controversial topics like abortion, gay marriage, and drugs. We need to address the pay discrepancy between FOH and BOH staff in the restaurant industry. And we need to fight for universal healthcare, which is a basic human right.
