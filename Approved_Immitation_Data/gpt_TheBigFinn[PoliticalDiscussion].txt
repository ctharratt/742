In the world of politics, anything is possible. The current presidential race in the United States is a prime example of this. With the rise of Donald Trump, many people are left wondering what his true intentions are. Is he really running for president, or is he just trying to help his friend Hillary Clinton win the election? This theory has been circulating for some time now, and it's not hard to see why. First of all, let's take a look at Trump's campaign. He has been saying things that are antithetical to what moderate Republicans, independents, and Democrats believe. He has been promoting himself shamelessly, acting like a "fascist carnival barker" that is only interested in getting attention. He has been splintering the Republican base, which is the brand he is supposedly representing. All of this seems to be working in Hillary Clinton's favor. If Trump is really running as a grifter in order to humiliate and splinter the Republican base and smooth a path to presidency for his friend Hillary, then this is a deceitful and conspiratorial move. It's subterfuge at its finest. If Hillary is in on it, then she is using an incredibly risky and dirty trick to win. A more "publicly acceptable" Republican candidate like Marco Rubio could block her bid for power, something she and a lot of people have wanted for a long time. But even if only Trump knows this in his crazy brain, it's still deceitful. One candidate purposefully framing himself as "the bad guy" in order to let the other candidate win is deceptive. Just because she's not buying votes, blackmailing people, or other traditionally corrupt or deceitful political tricks doesn't mean what she and Trump are doing isn't wrong. If Hillary wins the presidency through subterfuge, then her victory would be undeserved because she didn't face any "true competition." If people have trust issues with Hillary now, no one would trust her if she became president through conspiracy. Even if she said Donald did it without telling her, the damage would already be done. Winning through subterfuge makes the team look bad. But let's say that Trump is really running for president and he's not trying to help Hillary win. Even in this scenario, his campaign is still causing problems for the Republican Party. He is splintering the base and promoting himself shamelessly, which is not helping the party's brand. He is also saying things that are antithetical to what moderate Republicans, independents, and Democrats believe, which is not helping the party's chances of winning the election. The fact that Trump is leading in the polls is a testament to how divided the Republican Party is. There are many people who are fed up with the establishment and are looking for someone who is not a career politician. Trump is tapping into this sentiment and is using it to his advantage. But at what cost? If Trump wins the nomination, then the Republican Party will have a hard time winning the election. Many moderate Republicans, independents, and Democrats will not vote for him because of the things he has said and the way he has conducted himself. This will make it easier for Hillary to win the election. But even if Trump doesn't win the nomination, he has already caused a lot of damage to the Republican Party. He has splintered the base and promoted himself shamelessly, which is not helping the party's brand. He has also said things that are antithetical to what moderate Republicans, independents, and Democrats believe, which is not helping the party's chances of winning the election. In the end, it's hard to say what Trump's true intentions are. Is he really running for president, or is he just trying to help his friend Hillary win the election? Only time will tell. But one thing is for sure: his campaign is causing a lot of problems for the Republican Party. If they want to win the election, they need to find a way to unite the base and promote a candidate who can appeal to moderate Republicans, independents, and Democrats.
