Yo, what's up my fellow gamers? It's your boy back at it again with some hot takes on the gaming world. First off, can we talk about how my mom wouldn't give me a Pepsi? Like, come on, it's just one Pepsi. I don't understand why she had to be so stingy with it. But hey, at least I have my trusty gaming rig to keep me company. Speaking of gaming rigs, let's talk about building your own versus buying pre-built. Now, I know some of y'all might be thinking that buying pre-built is the way to go, but let me tell you, building your own is where it's at. Sure, it might take a little more time and effort, but the satisfaction of knowing you built your own beast of a machine is unbeatable. Plus, you can save some serious cash by doing it yourself. But let's be real, not everyone has the time or know-how to build their own rig. And that's okay! There are plenty of pre-built options out there that can handle modern games with ease. Just make sure you do your research and don't get ripped off by some overpriced Alienware nonsense. Now, when it comes to games, there are a few classics that everyone should try at least once. Skyrim and Minecraft might seem like obvious choices, but hear me out. These games have some serious modding potential, which means you can essentially create your own game within the game. And if you're not into those, head over to /r/gamingsuggestions for some personalized recommendations. But let's not forget about some of the newer games out there. Metal Gear 5 might not have been the best in the series, but it was still a solid sniping game. And don't even get me started on Dying Light. That game is still incredibly popular and profitable, even if it's not quite as hyped up as it used to be. And speaking of hype, can we talk about Fallout 4? Look, I know it had its issues at launch, but with the help of the modding community, it's become a much better game. And let's be real, it's still way better than the new Tomb Raider game. Sorry, not sorry. But enough about games, let's talk about hardware. Specifically, GPUs. Now, I know some of y'all might be on a budget, but trust me when I say that you don't want to skimp on your graphics card. Sure, you can get a decent one for $500, but if you want to run games on high settings, you're gonna need to shell out a little more cash. And when it comes to recording gameplay, there are a ton of options out there. Fraps might be simple, but it gets the job done. Dxtory might not work for everyone, and Afterburner and OBS can make you sound like you're in a bathroom stall. But hey, at least we have options, right? Now, let's talk about some specific games. ARK: Survival Evolved might be a system hog, but it's still a fun game. Just make sure you avoid the official servers, because they're complete garbage. And if you're a fan of tactical RPGs, you need to check out the modding community for Final Fantasy Tactics. Trust me, it's glorious. And finally, let's talk about something near and dear to my heart: LED lights. Blue LEDs increase cooling power, while red LEDs just look cool. And don't even get me started on the power of SubZero. It's all about finding the right balance of colors to make your rig look and run like a dream. So there you have it, folks. My ramblings on gaming, hardware, and everything in between. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go try out my new drinking game, DEAD DRUNK. Because what's better than playing video games and getting drunk at the same time? Nothing, that's what.
