So, I was watching TV the other day and I couldn't help but notice how they fit some games in between the same Sportscenter over and over and over. And Sportscenter now equals high school athletes who have cancer, some random tweets, and post-death retrospectives about surfing bulldogs. I mean, what happened to the good old days of just showing highlights and scores? Now it's all about the drama and the tears. But hey, did you know that you can watch the seasons of some shows in any order? Yeah, just a little FYI for you there. They shot this season of one show in March, hence the lack of snow. I thought the creator of that show was making an X-Men show for FX? I mean, it's a movie about a stoner who is secretly a killer spy. I wasn't expecting it to be amazing, and it was just a fun little action comedy I think. I think it was better written than it was directed, so it didn't really get to its full potential. Speaking of potential, did you hear about that actress who was tied up in a pre-Bridesmaids contract? She was on a six-year contract, which is why she was still doing that show. It's easy work, relative to other projects, and pays well. But she's commanding huge fees for films now and the show is basically costing her time, money, and prestige. It hurts the "brand" more than anything. She could make an entire huge comedy movie in the time it takes to film a season and make $10 million a movie at this point. I don't think the Mike and Molly syndication dollars are in that range. But let's talk about some people who are making it big in Hollywood. I remember hearing about this one guy who was a real jerk at Comic-Con a few years ago. Matt Mira on the Nerdist podcast even called him out for being an asshole at SDCC as well, just refused to say his name. Said the "son of a famous comedy director" or something. But again, all this was four years ago or so. A lot of people grow up between 26 and 30. This was also like four years ago or so. So it's very possible he's cooler now. I've actually hung out with him before, in that way where he's a friend of a friend and joins us for the night. He was insufferable. Made it all about him, wanted to be the center of attention all the time. He wasn't a dick, he was just super super annoying. It was like a mixture of the king of the theater kids and the king of the hipsters, with a dash of super rich kid. But I still like all of his movies, American Ultra was really cool, and I'll see pretty much anything he writes. Speaking of movies, have you seen that new one produced by Michael Bay? I hear Michael Bay and usually run the other way. But the production values look amazing, I just assumed it was crappy since Bay produced it. I'm waiting until January for the Blu Ray. It's not on any streaming services, and I don't like buying digitally when I can get a physical Blu Ray for the same price basically. Can't wait to see it. I've got all of Hannibal to start in the meantime. But let's talk about some TV shows that have been snubbed by award shows. I mean, what's up with that? I think the Hollywood Foreign Press Association gets more weight than it should. I'm actually more surprised there were no Leftovers nominations at the SAG awards. I'm hoping it's an eligibility thing and this season will be up for next year's SAGs. The Affair was very good, very easily digestible (compared to Leftovers) and starred two high-profile British actors and was created by a high-profile Israeli showrunner. This is the Hollywood FOREIGN Press Association. They lean heavily towards things that get international acclaim, and that feature international talent. I think Outlander, the biggest head-scratcher nomination for me, is a bigger hit outside the US, and again it's a British produced show starring mostly British people. Leftovers is a decidedly American show, in tone, setting, and talent. I think Eccleston is the only prominent non-American cast member. But if it gets snubbed at the Emmys we riot. We burn this place to the ground. We make them remember. And let's not forget about some recent controversies. Did you hear about that one episode of that one show that was just terrible? It undid a lot of goodwill for me. And what about that one candidate who doesn't believe in science? Or the one who made up a lie that he tried to murder his friend with a knife? You can't make that stuff up. But hey, at least we have some good comedy material with the GOP front runners. Larry David is just being the exaggerated version of himself, aka George, aka NYC Jew. And come on. I'm not even talking policy here. Crazy tweeting billionaire? Compulsive lying neurosurgeon who doesn't believe in science? Runt brother of the Bush family who can't get through a debate? You might not agree with Hillary and Bernie on a policy level, but they aren't jokes like these guys. They factually aren't. If you think the GOP field is anywhere near as presidential, legitimate, and experienced as the Dems, you have blinders on. But let's end on a positive note. I'm excited for some upcoming movies and TV shows. And who knows, maybe that one guy who was a jerk at Comic-Con has grown up and become a better person. We can always hope, right?
