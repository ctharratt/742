Yo, what's up my fellow hustlers? Dropping some knowledge bombs on y'all. Let's start with the topic of FBA used clothing. Honestly, I don't see the point in putting that back on the market. Who's gonna buy that stuff? Instead, focus on flipping printer parts. Yeah, I know it can take a while for them to sell, but when they do, you can make some serious bank. Just make sure you know which parts are worth selling - rollers, toners, trays, removable parts, transfer bits, and front plates in great condition are all good bets. And if you're really savvy, you can even sell motherboards and power boxes. But be warned, that's a long-term investment. Now, if you want to go the supplier route, hit up local printer and electronic shops. You might be able to find some folks who are willing to buy from you. But before you start flipping anything, ask yourself - what are your priorities? Are you in it for the quick cash or the long-term gains? Figure that out first before you start sourcing. And let me tell you, I've worked for the E-Comm departments of Goodwill before, and those guys know what they're doing. They've figured out that they can make way more money from online buyers than local ones. They've got about 20 employees just to run the E-comm department of 7 different stores. They list on about 6 different sites and know how to sell most of the items they get. And here's a pro tip - if a book has a barcode and is being sold at your local Goodwill, it's because they know they can't sell it online. They scan everything, and if something has a certain value, it gets sent to the E-comm department to sell. They sell at such a ridiculous rate that they use UPS at Federal Government rates. They can ship and sell a book at about 30% cheaper rates than most of us get through USPS media mail. But be careful, there are some sketchy things going on in the online marketplace. For example, in the phone app, they sell space for products like JCPenney's, which makes the customer leave the eBay market into an entirely unrelated buying space. And if you're selling a large order, make sure to set up some sort of penalty if you have to refund. Otherwise, eBay will side with the buyer, and you don't want to deal with the fuckery of a chargeback of that large of a value. Now, let's talk about some tools that can make your life easier. If you're sourcing books, download Amazon Flow. It's an app that lets you scan the barcode of a book and instantly see its pricing and sales rank. And if you're using social media to promote your business, get Hootsuite. It lets you manage all your social media accounts from one dashboard, so you can save time and focus on making money. And finally, let's talk about packing and shipping. If you're shipping items that could be a choking hazard, make sure to use the appropriate warning bags. And don't abuse the Prime system, or Amazon will catch you eventually and ban you. And if you're shipping internationally, be mindful of the costs. Runs can be expensive, so try to find ways to save money. And if you're really stuck, hit me up and I'll see if I can help you out. So there you have it, folks. Some tips and tricks to help you hustle smarter, not harder. Remember, always be on the lookout for new opportunities and never stop learning. Peace out.
