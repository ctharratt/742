On December 12th, 2015, I witnessed a subway suicide. It was a horrific act that has left me traumatized and haunted. I hardly take the subway and mostly drive everywhere, but for this particular day, I decided to act environmentally responsible and take transit. After attending an all-day event watching Architectural Final Crit presentations at Ryerson, I headed home. As I left the building, I realized I was sort of mid-way between Dundas and College stations. I decided to walk up to College since the weather was mild. I was heading northbound on the Yonge line and knew that I would need to exit the Sheppard station (destination) from the last subway car since it's closest to my street exit. I walked to the end of the platform where the trains enter. There was no sign of trains. I walked up to the yellow line to see if it was coming anytime soon, and it was not. So I returned to the back wall where I felt safe. Including myself, there were five people in proximity to me. The guy to my right was staring across to the southbound platform listening to music. The elderly woman to my left was reading a magazine. The guy left to her was playing on his phone, and finally, a black man in his 30s was nervously pacing up and down checking for the subway to arrive. I have been raised to be street smart and on guard when in public. I guess traveling abroad to unknown lands with different cultures has sharpened my awareness of surroundings. Anyways, this pacing man caught my attention. I didn't know what to make of him. Could he be a potential threat to people around him? Did he need to go to the washroom badly? Did he need to be somewhere and was late because we had been standing on the platform for at least 10 minutes since I entered the station? Then the roar of the subway could be heard, and this man stood at the corner of the yellow line and tunnel peaking towards the train. As the train was seconds from entering, he took 2 large steps back and then ran and jumped. I wanted to yell "STOP," but I couldn't. My brain short-circuited, and I went into shock and disbelief at what I was witnessing, and everything appeared to be moving in slow motion. I was horrified, yet amazed at how perfectly he timed his jump. He hit the windshield hard and then fell down, and about 3 cars passed before the subway came to a screeching halt. The smell of burning brakes inundated the station. People that didn't see what happened thought a fire had broken out because there was a heavy smoke presence. I was about 10 feet from the jumper and could not do anything about it, and I am still haunted from what I saw. People who were standing near the middle of the station on the yellow line probably had a much worse visual since they probably also saw the man get trampled by the train. From where I was standing, I thankfully did not have a visual of the tracks, but I was still very much traumatized by it and felt sad for the jumper as I'm sure he had severe depression or mental illness. The main purpose of writing this is to help me heal from the experience. I was amazed that TTC kicked everyone out, evacuated everyone to put it nicely, so they could attend to the jumper if he was still alive. What was shocking was that there was no assistance at the upper level or street level for the witnesses. They just told us to leave. There were many people crying, holding their heads confused and in disbelief, but no support for them. I ended up walking with the majority of people a couple of stations north to Yonge and Bloor, where I boarded the train heading to my destination. The announcements could be heard, saying there was a delay due to "personal injury." No mention of injury at track level, just personal injury. The entire weekend, I was messed up and couldn't get the incident out of my head. So I called a friend that worked at TTC, and he mentioned there is a number to call if passengers call for assistance. After the third day of the incident, I decided to call. The switchboard directed me to customer service, who in turn directed me to a third-party company that deals with these issues. After a few minutes with them on the phone, they told me they couldn't help me because I wasn't employed by a company where they can bill this service too, but did offer to transfer me to a local community representative who could guide me where to find self-guided information online. I was ticked off. I could have searched for info online myself. For the record, I am self-employed, and they could not accommodate me, which I found ridiculous. It also made me think about other groups that wouldn't qualify for TTC counseling, such as homeless people or people with addiction or mental illness with a higher chance of suicides. The system is severely flawed. I ended up visiting my family physician, and he gave me some anti-anxiety meds since my head was working overload. I am going to write a letter to the TTC and maybe some other institution about the lack of support I received from witnessing this terrible, sad, and gruesome act. The TTC needs to do more to support witnesses of traumatic events. It's not enough to just evacuate the station and attend to the victim. People who witness these events need support too. The TTC should have a team of trained professionals who can provide counseling and support to witnesses of traumatic events. They should also have a hotline that people can call to get help and support after witnessing a traumatic event. Furthermore, the TTC needs to do more to prevent suicides on their tracks. They should install barriers or other safety measures to prevent people from jumping onto the tracks. They should also provide more support and resources for people with mental illness or depression. Suicide is a preventable tragedy, and the TTC needs to do more to prevent it from happening on their tracks. In conclusion, witnessing a subway suicide was a traumatic experience that has left me haunted and traumatized. The TTC needs to do more to support witnesses of traumatic events and prevent suicides on their tracks. It's time for the TTC to take action and make their system safer for everyone.
