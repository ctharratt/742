As a relatively new player to Magic: The Gathering, I have been learning a lot about the game and the community surrounding it. One thing that has stood out to me is the issue of gender inequality within the community. I have seen numerous posts and comments from female players who have experienced sexism and harassment at events and within online communities. It is disheartening to see that in 2021, women are still facing these issues in a hobby that should be inclusive and welcoming to all. I have also seen some male players dismiss these concerns, claiming that they have never witnessed any instances of sexism or that it is just a few bad apples spoiling the bunch. However, as someone who has only been involved in the community for a short time, I have already witnessed some concerning behavior. For example, during a game at my local game store, a male player insisted on saying "ladies first" every time it was his turn to take an action. At first, I thought it was just a harmless joke, but as the game went on, it became clear that he was doing it to gain an advantage. It made me feel uncomfortable and singled out, and I couldn't help but wonder if he would have done the same thing if I were a male player. Another issue that has come up recently is the scarcity of certain cards, particularly the Zendikar Expeditions lands. These lands are highly sought after by players, but they are extremely rare and difficult to obtain. Some players have accused Wizards of the Coast, the company that produces Magic: The Gathering, of intentionally limiting the supply of these cards to drive up demand and prices. While I cannot speak to the intentions of Wizards of the Coast, it is clear that the scarcity of these cards has caused frustration and disappointment among players. It is also worth noting that the high prices of these cards make them inaccessible to many players, particularly those who are just starting out or who cannot afford to spend large sums of money on the game. Despite these issues, I still love playing Magic: The Gathering and being a part of the community. I have met many wonderful people who are passionate about the game and who are committed to making it a welcoming and inclusive space for everyone. However, it is important to acknowledge and address the issues of sexism and inequality within the community. We need to listen to the experiences of female players and take their concerns seriously. We also need to hold ourselves and others accountable for our actions and words, and work towards creating a more inclusive and respectful community. One way to do this is by promoting diversity and representation within the game itself. Magic: The Gathering has made strides in recent years towards including more diverse characters and storylines in its cards and lore. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in terms of representation for women and people of color. Another way to promote inclusivity is by actively calling out and addressing instances of sexism and harassment within the community. This means speaking up when we witness inappropriate behavior, and supporting and believing those who come forward with their experiences. In conclusion, while Magic: The Gathering is a fun and engaging game, it is not immune to issues of sexism and inequality. As members of the community, we have a responsibility to address these issues and work towards creating a more welcoming and inclusive space for all players.
