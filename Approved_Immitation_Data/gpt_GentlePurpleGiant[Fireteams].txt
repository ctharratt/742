Yo, what's up guys? It's your boy here, and I'm back with some more gaming talk. So, I won't be back from my holiday for another week, but don't worry, there will be plenty of others on tonight. I'm sure we'll have a blast shooting some aliens in the face together. Just make sure to check out our clan group message for all the latest chatter. As soon as you're accepted, you'll be able to meet all my members and join in on the fun. Now, I know some of you might not be familiar with the whole process of joining our clan, so let me break it down for you. First things first, you gotta download the Destiny app from the Android or Apple Store. It's totally free, so don't worry about that. Once you've got the app, sign in using your PSN account and password. Don't worry, we won't give out your info to anyone. Next, head over to the community tab and select "my groups." From there, search for us, the Pineapple Chain Gang. Now, this is where things get a little tricky. You'll need to use your browsing app on your phone or computer browser to request to join our clan. The app won't let you do it, which is pretty dumb if you ask me. Once you've sent in your request, just sit tight and wait for one of our admins to accept it. It's that simple! And if you're having trouble with any of this, just hit me up and I'll walk you through it. I'm always happy to help out my fellow gamers. Now, I know some of you might be thinking, "But, I'm already in another clan. Can't I just join yours too?" And to that, I say no. Sorry, but we don't want any confusion or drama in our clan. We're all about having fun and playing games together, not causing unnecessary drama. Anyway, back to the topic at hand. I'm really excited to get back from my holiday and jump back into some gaming with you guys. I've been practicing my skills and I'm ready to take on any challenge that comes our way. So, let's get ready to shoot some aliens in the face and have a great time together. Oh, and one more thing. If you're not already following me on Twitch, you're missing out. I stream all the time and it's a great way to connect with other gamers and see some awesome gameplay. So, head on over to my channel and hit that follow button. You won't regret it! Alright, that's all for now. Thanks for listening to my ramblings and I'll see you all in the game soon. Peace out!
