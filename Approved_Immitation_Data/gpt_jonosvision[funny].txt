Oh man, there's nothing quite like blueberry season. It's like a little slice of heaven on earth. I mean, I will literally buy them by the 5 pound case and have it polished off in three days. And then, of course, I'll go out searching for more like it's blue-coloured crack. I miss them so much during these cold winter months.  Your son has good sense, I'll give him that. A lot of companies do this with berries as well. Think your blueberry toaster waffles have real blueberries? Nope, most likely pieces of apple dyed blue with blueberry flavouring. Same goes for a lot of 'berry' cereals. Always check the labels, you'd be surprised how much is just apples or other cheap fruit being coloured and flavoured.  It was on a National Geographic special called 'Into the womb' and the episode is called multiples. And I just checked and it's actually on youtube: it's really fascinating. What I always found fascinating was the theory that left-handed people are one of the surviving twins of a certain type called 'mirror twins'.  But let's get back to blueberries. I mean, have you ever had a fresh, juicy blueberry straight off the bush? It's like a little burst of flavour in your mouth. And don't even get me started on blueberry pie. I could eat a whole one by myself, no problem.  But here's the thing, not all blueberries are created equal. You want to make sure you're getting the good stuff. Look for plump, firm berries with a deep blue colour. And if you're really lucky, you might even find some wild blueberries. Those are the best.  I remember one summer when I was a kid, my family went blueberry picking. We drove out to this farm and spent the whole day picking berries. It was hot and sticky, but it was so worth it. We came home with buckets full of blueberries and spent the next few days making all sorts of blueberry treats.  And let me tell you, there's nothing quite like homemade blueberry jam. It's so much better than anything you can buy in the store. And it's not that hard to make either. Just mix some blueberries, sugar, and lemon juice together and let it simmer on the stove for a while.  But blueberries aren't just delicious, they're also really good for you. They're packed with antioxidants and other nutrients that can help keep you healthy. Plus, they're low in calories, so you can eat as many as you want without feeling guilty.  I mean, I know I'm not the only one who loves blueberries. They're a staple in so many different dishes. You can put them in smoothies, pancakes, muffins, and so much more. And don't even get me started on blueberry cheesecake.  But here's the thing, not all blueberry products are created equal. You want to make sure you're getting the real deal. There are so many products out there that claim to have blueberries in them, but they're really just using artificial flavouring.  So always check the labels. Make sure you're getting real blueberries, not just some cheap knockoff. And if you're not sure, just buy fresh blueberries and add them to whatever you're making. Trust me, it's worth it.  I mean, I could go on and on about blueberries. They're just so darn good. But I think I've made my point. Blueberries are amazing, and if you haven't tried them yet, you're missing out.  In conclusion, blueberry season is the best time of year. I will buy them by the 5 pound case and have it polished off in three days. Your son has good sense. A lot of companies do this with berries as well. Always check the labels, you'd be surprised how much is just apples or other cheap fruit being coloured and flavoured. Blueberries are not only delicious, but they're also really good for you. They're packed with antioxidants and other nutrients that can help keep you healthy. So go out and get yourself some fresh blueberries today. Trust me, you won't regret it.
