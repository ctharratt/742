It's been a few weeks since I last saw her and I can't seem to get her out of my head. I know it's crazy, but I can't help the way I feel. Every time I close my eyes, I see her face and hear her voice. It's like she's haunting me. I've tried to distract myself by going out with friends and meeting new people, but nothing seems to work. I'm constantly checking my phone, hoping to see a message from her. I know it's pathetic, but I can't help it. The last time we spoke, she seemed distant and uninterested. I don't know what I did wrong. Maybe I came on too strong or said something stupid. I wish I could go back in time and do things differently. I've been thinking about reaching out to her, but I don't want to come across as desperate or clingy. I don't know if she even wants to talk to me anymore. Maybe she's moved on and forgotten about me. It's hard to accept that someone you care about doesn't feel the same way. I thought we had a connection, but maybe I was just imagining things. Maybe she was just being polite and didn't want to hurt my feelings. I know I need to move on and let go of this obsession, but it's easier said than done. I keep replaying our conversations in my head, trying to figure out what went wrong. I wish I could just forget about her and move on with my life. But every time I try to forget, something reminds me of her. A song on the radio, a picture on social media, a place we went to together. It's like the universe is conspiring to keep her in my thoughts. I don't know what to do. Should I reach out to her and try to talk things out? Or should I just accept that it's over and move on? I don't want to make things worse, but I also don't want to regret not trying. Maybe I just need to give it time and let my feelings fade away. Maybe I need to focus on myself and my own happiness instead of relying on someone else to make me feel complete. It's hard to admit, but maybe I was putting too much pressure on her to be the answer to all my problems. Maybe I need to learn to be happy on my own before I can be happy with someone else. I don't know what the future holds, but I know I need to take control of my own life and stop letting my emotions control me. It's time to let go of the past and focus on the present and the future. I don't know if I'll ever find someone who makes me feel the way she did, but I know I can't keep living in the past. It's time to move on and start a new chapter in my life. I'll always cherish the memories we shared, but it's time to make new memories and create new experiences. Life is too short to dwell on the past and what could have been. So, I'm going to take a deep breath, let go of the past, and embrace the future. Who knows what adventures and opportunities await me? All I know is that I'm ready to face them head-on and make the most of every moment.
