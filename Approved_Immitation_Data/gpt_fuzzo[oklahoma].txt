Well, well, well. It seems like we have a lot to talk about today. Let's start with Tulsa World. I mean, come on, people. If you're hitting the site 25 times, you should just buy a subscription. It's not that hard. Or, if you're really against paying for news, just clean out your cookies. Get a dog and train it to sniff out cars. Then, profit. I mean, it worked for someone last year, right? But let's move on to more pressing matters. Have you heard about Stephen Tyler Holman? This man spoke out against militarized police equipment and civil asset forfeiture, and now he's being targeted by the authorities. It's ridiculous. Asset forfeiture allows police to seize property they allege is involved in a crime, even if the owner has not been arrested or convicted. And police departments use forfeiture to benefit their bottom lines, making seizures motivated by profit. It's a corrupt system, and Holman was brave enough to speak out against it. Now he's facing felony charges because the novelty store he manages sells glass pipes. It's a politically-motivated attack, and it's disgusting. Speaking of corruption, have you heard about Mary? She's a radical Protestant who uses Satan to subdue and enthrall her poor and poorly educated constituents. She knows full well what she's doing and cynically justifies her power grabs with 'Jesus' and 'decency'. It's straight out of the ALEC play book. We need to be careful with people like her. If she gets elected, we're in for a shit storm that will make Mary's little gig look like a toddler's birthday party. And let's not forget about the manufacturing industry in Oklahoma. We used to have light industry all over the state, making everything from hard drives to belt buckles. But most of those jobs went to Mexico with NAFTA. It's time to bring those jobs back to Oklahoma. We have a willing labor force, and there's no reason not to begin again. Except, of course, for the fact that the legislature is made up of plumbers and preachers. We need people who understand the importance of manufacturing and are willing to fight for it. But let's not get too caught up in politics. Have you ever ordered something online and had it arrive in a crushed carton? It's infuriating. And don't even get me started on university students who aren't offended. If a university isn't offending its students, it's doing something wrong. And revenge down voting? That's just for assholes. Now, let's talk about the pipeline situation. The tribe is suing because the Bureau of Indian Affairs approved the renewal without the agreement of the landowners. It's a clear violation of their rights, and it's time for justice to be served. The group is asking for an injunction requiring Enable to remove the pipeline and for back pay for the use of the line, along with punitive damages. It's time for the authorities to start respecting the rights of the people they're supposed to be serving. And finally, let's talk about Fallin and Pruitt. These two are firmly devoted Koch employees just doing what they're told. It's time for them to start serving the people of Oklahoma, not just their corporate overlords. We need leaders who are willing to stand up for what's right, even if it means going against their donors. It's time for a change in Oklahoma politics, and it starts with us. So, there you have it. A lot to think about, a lot to be angry about, and a lot to fight for. Let's not let the corrupt politicians and corporations win. Let's stand up for what's right and fight for a better Oklahoma.
