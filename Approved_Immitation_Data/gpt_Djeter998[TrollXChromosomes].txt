Hey there! Aww, thank you so much for your kind words! Your username is pretty awesome too, I must say. It's always nice to hear that your giftee loved their gift, isn't it? I always get a little nervous when I send something out, so it's a huge relief when they enjoy it. I totally get what you mean about feeling like you're not casual enough for some guys. It's like, you want to be yourself and dress how you want, but at the same time, you don't want to come across as high-maintenance or anything. It's a tough balance to strike, for sure. But at the end of the day, you should always do what makes you feel good and confident. If that means wearing makeup and dressing up, then go for it! The right guy will appreciate you for who you are, no matter what you're wearing. I'm glad to hear that you're going to reach out to the people in charge about your Secret Santa gift. It's always better to ask and make sure everything's okay, rather than just assuming and potentially missing out on something awesome. And hey, if worse comes to worst, you can always just ask your SS directly if they had the wrong address or something. It's a small community, so it shouldn't be too hard to track them down. Humans of NY is amazing, isn't it? I always find myself getting lost in those stories for hours on end. And don't worry, I'm sure if you ever did run into the guy, you'd come up with something profound to say. Or at the very least, you could just tell him about the sandwich. I'm sure he'd appreciate that too. I totally understand what you mean about relationship anxiety. It's like, when you first start dating someone, everything is new and exciting and you're on top of the world. But as time goes on, you start to worry about whether they still feel the same way, or if they're getting bored of you. It's a tough feeling to shake, but just remember that it's normal to have those thoughts and feelings. The important thing is to communicate with your partner and make sure you're both on the same page. I'm glad to hear that you're not experiencing anxiety in general, just in relationships. That's definitely a good thing. And you're right, it's probably best to work on it yourself rather than bringing it up with your partner right away. But if it starts to become a bigger issue, don't be afraid to talk to them about it. Communication is key in any relationship. It's totally understandable to blame past relationships for your current paranoia. It's hard not to let those experiences color your perception of future relationships. But just remember that every person and every relationship is different. Try not to let your past experiences hold you back from enjoying the present. I'm glad to hear that your guy apologized for being moody and told you he was lucky to have you. That's definitely a good sign! And as for the texting thing, try not to read too much into it. Sometimes people just get busy or forget to text back. It doesn't necessarily mean anything about how they feel about you. If it becomes a pattern, then you can start to worry. But for now, just give him the benefit of the doubt. I love your Doctor Who references! I would totally go to a death metal concert with Capaldi too. And I'm glad to hear that your guy is amazing in bed and super sweet and considerate. Those are definitely important qualities to have in a partner. It's totally normal to feel gun-shy in good relationships. It's like, you want to enjoy the moment, but at the same time, you're scared of getting hurt. Just remember that it's okay to be vulnerable and open with your partner. That's how you build trust and intimacy. As for coping with paranoia, I try to remind myself that my partner chose to be with me for a reason. They wouldn't be with me if they didn't like me. And if something is bothering me, I try to bring it up with them in a non-accusatory way. It's important to communicate your feelings, but also to do so in a way that doesn't put your partner on the defensive. I'm glad to hear that you're being supportive of your guy's paleo diet, even if it means giving up bread and pasta for a little while. And hey, a carb-bloated belly can be sexy too! ;) Thanks for the compliment on my hair! And I totally get what you mean about mozzarella sticks. There's just something so satisfying about that melty, stretchy cheese. Yum. It's too bad that your guy's brother is emotionally closed-off. It can be tough to connect with people like that. But at least you have the best brother, right? And yeah, those shirts for the little girl are kind of weird. It's like, let her be a kid and enjoy her childhood without worrying about dating! Anyway, thanks for chatting with me. It's always nice to have someone to talk to about these things. You're a lovely creature with sparkling wisdom too! :)
