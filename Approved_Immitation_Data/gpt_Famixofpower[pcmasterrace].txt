Oh man, shouldn't have told them I was a Picasso fan. I mean, I know it wasn't actually Picasso, but there was someone who messed with perspectives and even did those cloth clocks. I can't remember the name right now, but it's bugging me. Anyway, I found this great website for downloading mods. I even downloaded Fakefactory's Half-Life 2, but it was a little too large and I didn't want to uninstall any of my other games.  Speaking of mods, did you know that bots can read images now? It's crazy! I just found out that it was one DLL file causing all my problems. I verified it several times and decided to reinstall, but then I thought the easiest thing to do was just wait for the daily mouse hover text to change.  But seriously, when did this become the console bashing sub? We should be welcoming all gamers, regardless of their hardware. It's not about the hardware you use, it's about the software in your heart.  And don't even get me started on those Christmas sales. The high number of users with gift cards and those damn "hackers" (let's be real, they're just doxxers) made it a nightmare. I just don't want to buy a game that I'll play for six hours and never touch again.  But what am I getting into with all these games? I've been loving RPGs and FPSs with replayability. I recently bought Hatred and I'm really enjoying the survival aspect of it.  Speaking of games, have you played that one with Sean Bean as the narrator? I heard it's multiplayer only, though. Is the community toxic?  I'm blowing through my allowance like a leaf blower. I got $200 and I'm already planning to spend $40 on pants (hopefully) and then I want to go to Salvation Army to find an awesome black trenchcoat. I doubt I'll have enough left over for a better graphics card, even with my dad's discount card.  And don't even get me started on data caps. I'm in Pennsylvania with a 300GB data cap from Armstrong and it's just ridiculous.  But let's talk about something more positive, like video game characters. Lara Croft is seriously one of the most detailed video game characters of all time. She even has more polygons than any other character from 2008. And her sex appeal is just a minor aspect of her character, in my opinion.  I love Tomb Raider for the puzzles and the actual tomb raiding. And have you played New Vegas? It's so open to roleplaying, some people even suspect the player character to be a synth with the memories of dead courier 6. How cool is that?  Anyway, I could go on and on about video games, but I think I've rambled enough for now. It's all about finding the right game for you and enjoying it to the fullest.
