Well, let me tell you something, folks. I've been a lifelong Democrat, but lately, I'm starting to feel like the party doesn't care about straight white males like me. It's like we're not wanted or maybe even a target. And don't even get me started on the SJW movement in the left. It's like they want to police every little thing we say or do. But let's talk about this UBI thing. I'm trying to understand the economics of it all. So let's say we make the 1% exclusively pay for it. That's 3.3 trillion in new taxes they would have to pay each year just to meet minimum funding. And that's not even including any administrative costs. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that seems like a lot of money. And what about the middle class? If they have to pay into it, but their UBI is less than or equal to their pay-in, then what's the point? It won't be a net benefit for them. So would only those over a certain income level pay into UBI which then gets distributed to those below said income level? But wouldn't this hurt the middle class? If not, why not? It seems like this would mostly affect the upper and lower classes. The middle class benefit would essentially be flat, no? And why can't I just keep my money? If I give the government a dollar, I don't get a dollar back. Wouldn't it make more sense to just lower my taxes? I mean, I'm all for helping those in need, but I don't want to be forced to do it. Now, let's talk about the 2nd amendment. I know some people want to take away our guns, but that's not the answer. Being disarmed isn't a guarantee that there won't be tyranny. If you really read history, you would know that in the 20th century alone, tens of millions were disarmed and killed by their own governments. Do you not agree? Do you think that just because you look at a snapshot in time and find no tyranny that there can never be any? When the people fear the government, there is tyranny. When the government fears the people, there is liberty. And don't even get me started on the idea of the government going door to door to confiscate guns. That's just tyrannical. I mean, there's no defined line in the sand, but history shows that it's a gradual process. There are many forms of tyranny, and most can be rectified via the ballot box. The 2nd amendment is a last resort - period. But let's talk about socialism. I'm trying to understand why those who champion it think it would work here in the U.S. I mean, I can't find any evidence that it would. And what about innovation and entrepreneurship? What motivates those things? Would the system get in the way of them? I'm just trying to get a better understanding here. And let's not forget about identity politics. It's ruining this country. We're all sisters and brothers. Screw percentages and polls and pundits. The three P's are used to divide and control. Is there a problem with white people? I mean, the fact that the Democrat party is overwhelmingly non-white compared to Republicans and especially compared to the country as a whole is a strong indicator that the party has a problem with race and racism. So, in conclusion, I'm just trying to understand things better. I'm not trying to be divisive or anything like that. I just want to know why things are the way they are and if there's a better way to do things. Is that too much to ask?
