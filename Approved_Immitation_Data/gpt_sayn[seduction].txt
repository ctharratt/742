Yo, what's up guys? I gotta say, I'm feeling pretty good today. Just got back from a killer night out, and I'm ready to share some of my thoughts with you all. First off, let's talk about negging. Now, I know some guys out there think it's a good idea to neg a girl about her physical appearance, but let me tell you, that's a big no-no. Girls can't handle that shit like guys can. So, my advice? Don't do it. And while we're on the topic, don't take her to a strip club either. That's just asking for trouble. Now, let's talk about masturbation and porn. Personally, I used to be a big fan of both. But last month, I stopped watching porn and beating off altogether because I had a hunch that it might've been causing some ED issues. And you know what? It's been a month since I did either, and I've definitely noticed a difference. I'm hornier now than I was before, and I'm much more attracted to real girls than I was when I was only getting hard for chicks who looked like pornstars. And speaking of girls, let's talk about how to win them over. One trick I've found to be really effective is to use her friends to DHV (that's demonstrate higher value, for those of you who don't know). When you're meeting up with her in front of her friends, treat it like you're opening a new set. Talk with her friends more than you would with her initially, and once you've won the group over and everyone loves you, shift your attention slowly to her. By the time you've got her friends laughing at all your jokes and interested in all your stories, your value to her will be through the roof. Now, let's talk about mindset. Nothing is good nor bad. Thinking makes it so. So, if a girl is playing games with you and confusing you, don't get mad. Just reply with "Cool, let me know when you grow up and figure out what you want" and go fuck ten more chicks. If she's not worth the time and effort, move on. And if a girl is being a bitch, don't let it get to you. Just play it cool and call her out on her bullshit. For example, if she says "Um, you're too fucking short for us," you can reply with "Bitch please, you're not good looking enough for me. I'm here to talk to your friend." It's all about being nonreactive and calling her out on her stupid statements. But at the end of the day, it's not all about getting laid. It's about personal growth and development. When I first started learning game, I was a super-nice guy who was always trying to please others. Then I flipped it and became a complete dick who didn't care about anyone else's feelings. Now, I'm trying to find that balance in between. I want to be the guy who enriches people's lives and makes them want to be around me. And you know what? It's working. I'm having more fun with people than ever before. I'm spreading joy everywhere I go, and it feels great. So, if you're struggling with game, don't just focus on getting laid. Focus on personal growth and development. Be the guy who enriches people's lives, and the rest will fall into place. Alright, that's all I've got for now. Keep on hustling, guys. Peace out.
