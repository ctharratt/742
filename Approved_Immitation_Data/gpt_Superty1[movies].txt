The topic at hand is the potential box office success of the latest Star Wars film, The Force Awakens. As a self-proclaimed movie buff and avid Star Wars fan, I have been following the buzz surrounding this film for months now. And let me tell you, the hype is real. First off, let's talk about the special editions. While some action junkies may enjoy the fast and over-crowded scenes, I personally prefer the original version. Sure, it may be a tad slower, but it's also more artistic. And let's not forget that the OG version didn't have any of those cringe-worthy CGI additions. Moving on to a completely unrelated topic, let's talk about Studio 8H. Did you know that it's only 6,339 square-feet? My dad's garage is bigger than that. And don't even get me started on the audience size. SNL has an audience of like 290 people tops. Seriously, how do they fit everyone in there? But back to Star Wars. The big question on everyone's mind is whether or not The Force Awakens will break box office records. Some are predicting that it will surpass Avatar and Titanic, while others are more skeptical. Personally, I think it's definitely going to hit the $2 billion mark, if not more. Of course, there are a lot of variables to consider. The movie hasn't even fully opened in every country yet, and there are tons of people waiting until Christmas or after to see it. But even with those factors in mind, I still have a hard time not thinking it will at least make $2 billion worldwide. One of the main driving forces behind Jurassic World's success worldwide was China. And considering that Fast 7 made something like $250 million in China, it's safe to say that the Chinese market is a huge factor in box office success. And let's not forget that China is a huge market for Star Wars merchandise as well. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. While I do think The Force Awakens will be a huge success, there's no guarantee that it will break every record ever. And that's okay. As long as it's a good movie, that's all that really matters. And from what I've heard, it's more than just a good movie. It's as good as A New Hope, better than Return of the Jedi, but not quite as good as Empire. And honestly, I would have been happy with it just being better than Revenge of the Sith. But it's not just the die-hard Star Wars fans who are excited about this movie. Even casual movie-goers are hyped up about it. I've never seen so much buzz surrounding a movie before. It's like everyone is collectively holding their breath, waiting to see if it lives up to the hype. And let's not forget about the new characters. Rey, Finn, and Poe have already become fan favorites, and for good reason. They're all complex, well-written characters who are easy to root for. And let's not forget about BB-8, the adorable new droid who has already stolen our hearts. But with all this hype comes a lot of pressure. J.J. Abrams and the rest of the crew have a lot riding on this movie. They have to please the die-hard fans while also appealing to a new generation of Star Wars fans. And let's not forget about the critics, who can make or break a movie's success. But I have faith in J.J. Abrams. He's proven himself to be a talented director time and time again. And with the original cast members returning, it's like a dream come true for Star Wars fans. In conclusion, I think The Force Awakens will be a huge success. Whether or not it breaks box office records remains to be seen, but I have a feeling it will at least hit the $2 billion mark. And even if it doesn't, that doesn't take away from the fact that it's a great movie. So let's all sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride. May the Force be with us all.
