Hey there. I'm really interested in hearing more about how being away from your mom has helped you heal. I know that being in a controlling and manipulative relationship can be really tough, and I'm glad that you're taking steps to move forward and grow from it. One thing that concerns me is the idea that this behavior might resurface in future relationships or friendships. It's important to trust yourself and be aware of your own tendencies, but also to recognize that you can't control other people's actions. That being said, I hope that you have a good support system in place and are able to seek help if you need it. I also want to touch on the fact that your current situation with your FWB doesn't sound very healthy. It's understandable that you care about him and want to be with him, but it's important to consider whether or not this relationship is truly fulfilling for you. If you're unhappy now, it's likely that things will only get worse over time. It's also important to set boundaries and stand up for yourself if he's being rude or disrespectful. I know that it can be hard to let go of people who aren't good for us, but sometimes it's necessary for our own well-being. You deserve to be with someone who treats you with kindness and respect, and who values your happiness and well-being. Regarding your confusion about the advertisement and tarpauline, I think what you're trying to say is that you made a mistake by bragging about sleeping with someone in the past, and that it caused problems in your current relationship. It's important to learn from our mistakes and try to be a better person moving forward. It's also important to recognize when someone is treating us poorly and to stand up for ourselves. If your current partner is flirting with other people and making you feel uncomfortable, it's important to have a conversation with him about it and set clear boundaries. Similarly, if you're in a situation where someone is treating you badly or taking advantage of you, it's important to speak up and take action. Whether that means calling the police or simply cutting ties with that person, you deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. In terms of your job and school situation, it's important to prioritize your own well-being and figure out what works best for you. If you need the paycheck from your job, that's understandable, but it's also important to make sure that you're not sacrificing your education or mental health in the process. Ultimately, it's important to remember that you are strong and capable of overcoming any challenges that come your way. Whether you're dealing with a difficult relationship, a tough job situation, or anything else, you have the power to take control of your life and make positive changes. Just remember to take things one step at a time and be kind to yourself along the way.
