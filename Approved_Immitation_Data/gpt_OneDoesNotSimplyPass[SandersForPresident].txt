The current state of the Democratic Party is a far cry from what it used to be. The party has been infected with a post-Reaganist Blue Dog Third Way Neoliberalism that has divided the party and caused it to lose sight of its core values. This divide and conquer strategy has been used by reactionaries to separate identity politics from class politics, pitting disenfranchised groups against each other for political expediency. This individualist separation destroys collective efforts to benefit society and preys on the greed of even good-hearted progressives. The right-wing nonsense of individualism is the same ideology that convinces workers not to join unions because they can make it farther on their own. It is a strategy that preys on the greed of individuals and convinces them to abandon collective efforts to benefit society. This is not progressive, moral, or right. Progressives have an obligation to fight against this non-sense and bring marginalized groups into the limelight while maintaining their position there. The message of "Black lives don't matter until ALL black lives matter, whether they're gay, or women, or trans, etc" is so important. We cannot divide ourselves up by how we're marginalized and abandon groups for the hopes of expediency. It is the obligation of progressives to fight against this non-sense and bring marginalized groups into the limelight while maintaining their position there. The current state of the Democratic Party is not progressive. It is a faux-progressivism that only supports disenfranchised groups in the public limelight. Progressives have a responsibility and an obligation to both bring these groups into the limelight and maintain their position there. Relying on what is essentially pop political culture to guide your political advocacy is hurting, not helping, marginalized groups.
