Ugh, seriously? This is such a lame excuse. I mean, come on, battling wild Pokémon is like the bread and butter of the whole game. It's how you train your own Pokémon and level them up. Saying otherwise just makes you sound like you haven't even played the game before. I get it, they want to change things up and make it more realistic or whatever, but this is just taking it too far. I mean, what's the point of even having wild Pokémon if you can't battle them? It's like they're just there for show or something. And don't even get me started on how this is going to affect the whole catching Pokémon thing. I mean, if you can't battle them first, how are you supposed to weaken them and catch them? It's like they're just handing out free Pokémon or something. I mean, I guess they could make it so that you have to use some kind of special item or something to catch them, but that just seems like it would take away from the whole experience. Part of the fun of catching Pokémon is battling them first and then trying to catch them with a Pokéball. And what about all the trainers out there who specialize in catching and training wild Pokémon? Are they just going to be out of a job now? It just seems like such a waste to take away such a big part of the game. I mean, I get that they want to make it more realistic and all, but at what cost? Are they really willing to sacrifice such a big part of the game just to make it more like real life? I mean, if we wanted real life, we wouldn't be playing Pokémon, would we? And what about all the people who have been playing this game for years? Are they just supposed to forget everything they know about battling wild Pokémon and just accept this new way of doing things? It just seems like such a slap in the face to all the loyal fans out there. I mean, I guess we'll just have to wait and see how it all plays out, but I'm not holding my breath. It just seems like such a bad move on their part. I mean, why mess with something that's been working so well for so long? I just hope they come to their senses and realize that battling wild Pokémon is a crucial part of the game. Without it, the whole thing just falls apart. So please, game developers, don't take away our wild Pokémon battles. We need them.
