People are always looking for someone else to solve their problems. They want to be told what to do and how to do it. They don't want to take any initiative or responsibility for their own lives. This is why cults and crazy movements are able to attract followers so easily. They offer a sense of belonging and purpose that people crave. Context is important, as Joe Rogan says. It can change the way we perceive things and make them seem less bad than they actually are. For example, filling out NA on a form may not seem like a big deal in certain contexts, but in others, it could be seen as a serious offense. In Friday Night Lights, being an underdog doesn't mean you have to be a loser. It just means that people (such as the media, GOP, RNC, etc.) have to say you're going to lose. Americans love an underdog, and this is why someone like Donald Trump, who was initially seen as a long shot, was able to gain so much support. If Trump's dad was his age and had run for president, I would vote for him. Americans love a good underdog story, and Trump's constant rise in the polls is proof of that. In Fascism, the state runs the companies. This is the opposite of what we have in the United States, where companies are not working for the state. When Hitler said that we need more X, the companies made X. They didn't wait for the government to order more X so that they could sell more X. Most of our lawmakers are lawyers, and they don't care about what is actually right or wrong. They argue for whatever they want or whomever hired them. They don't do math, and they probably don't really know how since they can't even add and subtract numbers to balance a budget. This is why the bill passed locking it where it is. No one could agree on that number. Iowa is all about perception, but it's really a meaningless state that has a very limited number of delegates. Somehow, political people and the rest of America think it's important who wins a small state with very few delegate votes and is mostly ignored in the actual election. It appalls me how much an overall meaningless state is to presidential elections since its primary is so early. We need to rethink the way we choose our candidates and give more weight to states that actually matter. Why do we keep electing people that cry all the time? Obama is always on the verge of tears, and Boehner cried all the time. I want leaders to think with their heads and not just irrational knee-jerk emotions. I don't understand why people buy AK-47s if there is a ban. Maybe they're buying them illegally, or maybe they're buying them from other countries. I'm not sure how that works. I believe in helping out people, and I think parts of welfare are messed up. But the idea is solid, and I also think we need free/cheap college to compete with other 1st world countries since we are a service and tech country in reality. I like guns, and I think people should be able to buy them if they want to. I also disagree with free speech zones and think free speech can be had anywhere (as long as it doesn't cause immediate death like yelling fire to get people trampled to death, even though with today's movie theaters that's unlikely). I think the government should stay out of spying on US citizens, but the NSA and CIA should definitely spy on foreigners. Foreigners aren't protected by the US constitution. I just don't think that any of the Republican candidates (except, scarily, Trump sort of) or H Clinton have America's citizens as their priority. I didn't vote for Romney because he was a shill, and I didn't want Obama either, but it's not like I was given a real choice. I was actually hoping that Newt was going to be the nominee. He's the only Republican that had proven he could negotiate across the aisle. 90s Republicans were okay compared to today's, and modern Dems seem to act more like 90s Reps than liberals on many corporate and banking issues. To me, it's super annoying that the Koch-created Tea Party has leaned politics so far to the right that our government barely functions when you look at the few laws passed compared to the past and constant threat of government shutdown. Later bills by Congress locked up the assault weapons ban. The executive order actually made US companies and AR-15s more money and more popular, respectively. The change wasn't super huge. Obama cited a 1968 gun bill or act that already empowered the president to go after guns deemed extremely dangerous or something along those lines. The new order says that selling guns at gun shows, stores (i.e. pawn shops), and online sales need to have background checks done on buyers. Everyone online I've ever seen selling a gun ships it to an FFL out of state, and every time I go to a gun show, FFL dealers are the ones selling guns, not random people. I usually vote Democrat and want Sanders to win. I'm also a member of the NRA. I'm against any laws that lessen our rights as citizens. If there was a lobbying group that was trying to get protest zones overturned by using Congress, I'd donate to them as well. The poster doesn't know much about what they're saying. You can mail a shotgun to someone in another state that you sold them, but other than that, you're supposed to ship it to a dealer. In conclusion, people need to take more responsibility for their own lives and not rely on others to solve their problems. Context is important, and we need to look at things from different angles to get a better understanding of them. We need to rethink the way we choose our candidates and give more weight to states that actually matter. We need to focus on what's important and not get bogged down in meaningless political spats.
