Hey there, fellow fuck-uppers! It's your friendly neighborhood mod, here to talk about some of the recent posts we've had to remove from /r/tifu. Now, I know some of you may be feeling a bit salty about your post getting removed, but let me tell you, we have rules for a reason. And those rules are there to make sure that the content on this sub is top-notch, grade-A fuckery. First up, we have mac9330's post about opening their flight itinerary. Now, I get it, we've all been there. You're just trying to check your flight details and BAM, you accidentally open up your ex's itinerary instead. But here's the thing, mac9330, you gotta give us more context. What happened after you opened the itinerary? Did you accidentally book a flight to Timbuktu instead of your intended destination? Did you end up accidentally sending your ex a message about how much you miss them? We need the juicy details, my friend. Next, we have hexbeard's post about mixing up their girlfriend with their friend. Now, I know this may seem like a classic fuck-up, but here's the thing, folks. We want unique, original content. We don't want to see the same old tired tropes over and over again. So, hexbeard, I challenge you to come up with a more unique fuck-up. Maybe you accidentally called your boss "mom" during a meeting? Or maybe you accidentally sent a sext to your grandma instead of your significant other? Get creative, people! Moving on, we have forcelliott's post about almost killing their cat in their sleep. Now, I know what you're thinking, "How is that not a noteworthy fuck-up?" But here's the thing, folks. Farting in an enclosed space is not a noteworthy fuck-up. It's just gross. We want to see fuck-ups that are truly unique and interesting. So, forcelliott, I challenge you to come up with a more interesting fuck-up. Maybe you accidentally set your kitchen on fire while trying to make toast? Or maybe you accidentally sent a text meant for your crush to your entire contact list? The possibilities are endless, my friends. Moving on, we have happytreees' post about reading the comments on the Instagram of a guy they were recently seeing. Now, I know some of you may be thinking, "What's wrong with that?" But here's the thing, folks. We have rules about certain topics, and obscene sexual situations are a big no-no. So, happytreees, I challenge you to come up with a more appropriate fuck-up. Maybe you accidentally showed up to work in your pajamas? Or maybe you accidentally sent a text meant for your mom to your boss? Let's keep it PG, people. Next up, we have Raewin's post about making the classic mistake. Now, I know some of you may be thinking, "What's wrong with that?" But here's the thing, folks. We want unique, original content. We don't want to see the same old tired tropes over and over again. So, Raewin, I challenge you to come up with a more unique fuck-up. Maybe you accidentally showed up to a job interview with your shirt on inside out? Or maybe you accidentally sent a text meant for your best friend to your boss? Let's get creative, people! Moving on, we have somerandomthrowaw999's post about being socially awkward. Now, I know some of you may be thinking, "We've all been there." But here's the thing, folks. We want fuck-ups that are truly unique and interesting. So, somerandomthrowaw999, I challenge you to come up with a more interesting fuck-up. Maybe you accidentally showed up to a wedding in a clown costume? Or maybe you accidentally sent a text meant for your crush to your entire family? Let's get weird, people! Next up, we have thestumpymonkey's post about telling an adopted kid he was a disappointment to his family. Now, I know some of you may be thinking, "That's a pretty big fuck-up." But here's the thing, folks. We want fuck-ups that are unique to you. This isn't a fuck-up, it's just being a troll. So, thestumpymonkey, I challenge you to come up with a more unique fuck-up. Maybe you accidentally showed up to a job interview with your pants on backwards? Or maybe you accidentally sent a text meant for your boss to your ex? Let's keep it interesting, people. Moving on, we have cmm7152's post about giving themselves a bloody nose. Now, I know some of you may be thinking, "That's a pretty big fuck-up." But here's the thing, folks. We have rules about bodily discharge and sexual content. So, cmm7152, I challenge you to come up with a more appropriate fuck-up. Maybe you accidentally spilled coffee all over your boss's desk? Or maybe you accidentally sent a text meant for your significant other to your mom? Let's keep it clean, people. Next up, we have crayz5's post about going on /r/TIFU in class. Now, I know some of you may be thinking, "What's wrong with that?" But here's the thing, folks. We want unique, original content. We don't want to see the same old tired tropes over and over again.

Or maybe you accidentally sent a text meant for your boss to your crush? Let's get creative, people! Finally, we have JoeyCastle's post about driving the weird kid. Now, I know some of you may be thinking, "What's wrong with that?" But here's the thing, folks. We have rules about bodily discharge and sexual content. So, JoeyCastle, I challenge you to come up with a more appropriate fuck-up. Maybe you accidentally showed up to a job interview with your shirt on inside out? Or maybe you accidentally sent a text meant for your mom to your boss? Let's keep it PG, people. In conclusion, folks, let's keep the content on /r/tifu unique, interesting, and appropriate. And remember, if your post gets removed, don't take it personally. We just want to make sure that the content on this sub is the best it can be. Keep on fuckin' up, my friends!
