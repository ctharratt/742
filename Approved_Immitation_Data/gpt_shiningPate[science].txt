Thank you for your detailed and considered reply. I have been pondering the criteria used to determine whether different populations are distinct species. The article mentions genetic differences, but then focuses on vocalizations between the New Zealand and Australian populations. While vocalizations are certainly important, there are other factors to consider, such as social and feeding behaviors, as well as morphological differences. Take, for example, Eastern Pacific Orcas, which exhibit differences in all of these areas, yet are still classified as a single species. So, what specific criteria does biology use to determine the discovery of a new species? Is this just a team trying to push a vague definition in their domain for a brief moment of fame? These are important questions to consider, as the classification of a species can have significant implications for conservation efforts. Speaking of conservation, I recently spoke with an acquaintance who worked as a wildlife management ranger at Florida state parks. He mentioned that they often see all the baby sea turtles eaten by seagulls or ghost crabs before they can make it into the ocean. This is partially due to low numbers of sea turtles, but also because the populations of these predators have been distorted upwards by their access to food from humans. Essentially, humans are pigs. We spill our food and leave our garbage out where these predator/scavenger species can eat and thrive from it. Having thrived, there are a lot more of them than there would be naturally because of the increased food supply. This means there are greater numbers of them that can opportunistically prey on other species and kill them at higher rates than they normally would. On a completely different topic, I recently read about the monument builders in the stone age who transported 50 ton blocks over 100 miles with stone age transportation technologies. Wouldn't it have been more efficient to "dry fit" the parts in the quarry before going to the effort of transporting them? This mainly shows that these builders had ISO 9000 compliant processes, even in the stone age. Moving on to a more serious topic, I am concerned about the intolerant political-religious movement that has put 5 million people on the road to Europe. This is a humanitarian crisis that requires immediate attention and action. Switching gears again, I recently read an article about algae that can grow and kill cancer cells in vivo. This raises the question of whether there are varieties of algae that normally infect and kill mammals. I've heard of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, but is there a whole new class of infectious plants that we need to worry about encountering in the wild? On a related note, I noticed that your intro cites top-rate academic research in the US, but only a marginal job of process innovation. As a professor of materials science engineering, do you think that the materials science engineering graduate research labs lack an essential element of industrial design? Does Ohio State include industrial design in the materials science labs? Or would you advocate another approach, perhaps linking materials labs with (US-based) industry partners to provide a more effective transfer of research to practical manufacturing? What factors are needed to prevent the research from being immediately transferred to overseas manufacturers, as other posters in this thread have alluded to occurring with their work? Finally, I keep seeing climate change deniers citing a NOAA tropical cyclone metric, Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE), as proof that the IPCC predictions for increasing tropical cyclone frequency and strength are false. Is this statistic actually used for what is claimed? The past couple of years show relatively low ACE numbers, yet I've never heard so many "supertyphoons" in the news. Why aren't the supertyphoons raising the ACE statistic? Is the very rapid intensification seen with Patricia something we can expect to become more common? In conclusion, there are many important and diverse topics to consider, from species classification to conservation efforts, from stone age monument building to the current humanitarian crisis, from algae and cancer cells to materials science and climate change. It is important to approach each topic with an open mind and a willingness to learn and consider different perspectives.
