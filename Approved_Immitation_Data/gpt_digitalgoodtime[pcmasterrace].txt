I recently purchased a monitor for my PC build in October and I have to say, I am blown away by the 21:9 ratio. It completely eliminates the need for dual monitor set ups and the 29" version I got is better in terms of quality than the LG 34" version. I've read that the larger monitor has low pixel density and color bleeding issues. The monitor I got hits the right spot in terms of offering IPS, Freesync (75Hz) and 1080p goodness. I have to say, I am thoroughly impressed with the monitor and it has completely changed my gaming experience. The wider aspect ratio allows for a more immersive experience and I no longer have to deal with the annoying bezel in the middle of my dual monitor set up. The colors are vibrant and the picture quality is top-notch. I highly recommend this monitor to anyone looking for an upgrade. In terms of gaming, I recently picked up Dirt Rally and my god, it's beautiful. Playing a rally course in Monaco is an absolute treat for the eyes. The graphics are stunning and the gameplay is smooth. I've also been switching between Arma 3, Insurgency, and Elite Dangerous Horizons. Each game offers a unique experience and I find myself getting lost in the worlds they create. One thing I've noticed is that I have yet to play a game that auto detects my settings. I have over 130 games on Steam and not a single one has been able to detect my settings automatically. It's a bit frustrating having to manually adjust the settings for each game, but it's a small price to pay for the amazing gaming experience I get in return. As for my gaming setup, I'm still using my trusty wired Xbox 360 controller which has been with me since I was PC gaming on my laptop in Afghanistan. Both my Sony Vaio laptop and controller have been covered in layers of dust and sand, but they are both still going strong. Now I have only to worry about the god damn dust in my NYC apartment. I'm not in the military, but I am a civilian contractor working with the US military/counter intelligence. It's a challenging job, but I find solace in my gaming setup after a long day at work. It's a great way to unwind and escape from the stresses of the job. In terms of building PCs, I highly recommend checking out /r/buildapc or /r/pcgaming for specific things like building PCs. There's a subreddit for everything it seems and it's foolish to think that this subreddit should be streamlined to avoid things that most of us enjoy. You can simply ignore it if it's not your cup of tea. I recently built a PC with a 390 and plan to Xfire once the prices go below $200 for a 390 or higher. From my understanding, AMD's Xfire allows for mixing and matching AMD video cards for Xfire. So if I can get a 390X or Fury down the line, it would still work with my 390 in an Xfire. It's something I'm looking forward to in the future. As for the Oculus Rift, I'm waiting for it to go on sale because it comes with one. I'm excited to try it out and see how it enhances my gaming experience. I think it's a great step forward in terms of virtual reality and I can't wait to see where it goes in the future. Overall, I think PC gaming is a great way to escape from the stresses of everyday life. It allows me to immerse myself in different worlds and experience things I wouldn't be able to in real life. The monitor I purchased has completely changed my gaming experience and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an upgrade.
