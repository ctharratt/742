Alright, let's dive into this mess. First off, I have to say that some of these comments are just downright ridiculous. I mean, seriously, who thinks it's appropriate to tell their family that they can't come to their hotel room on New Year's Eve because they plan on doing "crazy butt stuff"? And then to top it off, the CEO of the hospital was tickled by it? What kind of workplace is this? Moving on, I have to say that I'm a bit concerned about the patient with the balance issues. It does sound like a traumatic brain injury, and I hope they're getting the proper care and treatment they need. And speaking of care and treatment, it's important to remember that the patient's wishes come first in the hospital. If mom doesn't want MIL in the room, then that's that. The nurses and staff will enforce it, and that's that. Now, let's talk about gifts. I don't care how much money someone has or doesn't have, it's never okay to throw a tantrum because you didn't get the gift you wanted. And then to insult the gift that you did receive? That's just rude and ungrateful. If you're going to act like a spoiled child, then don't expect anyone to want to give you anything in the future. Moving on to the topic of end-of-life care, it's important to have a plan in place. Whether it's inpatient care or something else, it's important to know what your options are and to make sure that your wishes are known. And speaking of wishes, it's important to have a partner who respects your career. If your spouse doesn't value the hard work and dedication that you put into your job, then that's a problem. Now, let's talk about drama. It seems like drama follows some people wherever they go. Whether it's in the BDSM community or in a hospital, there's always someone causing trouble. And speaking of hospitals, it's important to remember that nurses are the ones who run the show. They're the ones who make sure that everything runs smoothly, and they're the ones who have the most contact with patients. So if you're a student nurse, it's important to make friends with the nurses and nurse management on the unit. And finally, let's talk about age differences in relationships. While some studies suggest that an age gap up to 10 years is associated with lower divorce rates, it's important to remember that every relationship is different. Age is just one factor, and it's not the be-all and end-all. What's more important is compatibility and mutual respect. In conclusion, there's a lot of craziness in these comments. From inappropriate behavior in the workplace to drama in the BDSM community, it seems like there's never a dull moment. But at the end of the day, what's most important is treating others with respect and kindness, and making sure that your wishes are known and respected.
