Solid points, I just don't want to see a misrepresentation answered with another misrepresentation is all. It's important to look at the facts and not just rely on assumptions or hearsay. For example, when discussing the definition of "mass killing", it's important to actually look at the definition and not just assume it was pulled out of thin air. By doing a simple search for "define" in the cited PDF, one can see that the definition of "mass killing" is referenced. This definition was originally defined by the FBI, not by some random person on Reddit. It's also important to understand the distinction between murder and terrorism. While both are reprehensible acts of violence, terrorism requires certain criteria to be met in order to be considered terrorism. Abortion, for example, does not fit the criteria for terrorism, even from a pro-life perspective. It's important to use accurate terminology when discussing these issues. When it comes to politics, it's important to consider the differences between political systems and climates. The UK and the US have different political systems and the state of the right-wing in each country is also different. While the Tories govern almost by default in the UK, the Republican party is in disarray in the US. It's important to consider these factors when discussing potential candidates and their chances of winning. Neoliberalism is also a completely different ideology than what some people may think it is. It's important to understand the actual definition of a term before using it to describe something else. When it comes to issues like gun control and drug legalization, it's important to look at the facts and not just rely on propaganda or misinformation. Gun laws in Australia, for example, are widely popular and have been effective in reducing mass shootings. And while some may argue that drug legalization is still a long way off, public opinion is shifting rapidly and it's possible that more states will legalize in the near future. It's also important to consider the language used when discussing sensitive issues like abortion. While some may argue that using language like "even in case of rape or incest" is necessary to make a point, it can also alienate moderate voters who may not have strong feelings either way. It's important to appeal to a wide range of voters, not just those who already agree with you. Overall, it's important to approach issues with an open mind and a willingness to consider all sides of the argument. By doing so, we can have more productive and meaningful discussions about important issues.
