Alright, let's talk about some of the interesting plot points and gameplay mechanics that I've encountered in my time playing tabletop RPGs. First up, there was the cursed singing sword that we had to capture and bring back alive. This thing was so loud and obnoxious that it attracted everything nearby, including rusted objects that wanted it silenced. We had to play it on loop in the background during our return trip, which made for some hilarious moments as we tried to sneak past enemies while this thing blared away. Another memorable plot point involved a village girl that we saved from an evil cult. She kept running back to the cult because we were "nice people" who showed her how to make friends. Over time, bad things started happening in houses near hers, like random deaths and minor demon summonings. Eventually, something happened in-game that forced us five years into the future, and the girl had been captured again. Her husband offered us 100k to recover her, but it turned out to be a trap to sacrifice us to an ancient evil during their wedding ceremony. We managed to crash the wedding and escape, but not before one of us was forced to drink a strange liquid that turned out to be some kind of mind control potion. In the end, three out of five players died as a direct result of this girl's actions. It turned out that if we had done nothing to save her initially, exactly 347 lives (including 73 children) would have been saved in the town, and the cult would have been torn apart due to infighting. The husband even admitted that "she is special. We only realized how much after you took her back to the town." As for gameplay mechanics, I once played a Dwarf Zen archer monk who specialized in crafting bows and arrows. I had a dog that pulled a cart for me in the early levels, and my catchphrase was "why use a hammer when you can use your fists?" It was a fun character to play, and I made good money on the side thanks to my crafting skills. I was able to buff my crafting abilities and eventually craft magic weapons, but unfortunately, we never made it that far in the campaign due to players not being around enough. One thing that I always found helpful as a player was tracking carrying capacity. It factored into encumbrance penalties, which in turn played a role in combat. If players made a full item list at the beginning, it wasn't extra work to keep track of. Plus, most people get a T1 Bag of Holding anyway, which helps with carrying capacity. When it comes to spending money in-game, I always suggest saving 5-10k for pocket money after the first game to buy items that fill in personal gaps that became obvious after one game. Pooling 5-10k to cover group gaps is also a good idea. If something is missing, items can generally cover it. For example, if the party is lacking a tank, DPS, mage, or healer, there are items that can help fill those roles. As for experience points, I've played with both the book method and a simplified method where the DM tells us how many points we need to level up and grants 1-3 points for active participation. The simplified method seemed to work well for my group, and we even had characters of different levels due to death or absences. The key was to have a solid backstory and be motivated in-game with a solid reason/logic for why your character did things. Using skills in a new or unusual way also earned extra points. Finally, let's talk about some creative monsters and encounters. One that stands out to me was a huge construct that could capture creatures inside via the lure of good food, then beat them up with whatever was inside. It didn't have to be a golem, and making it a golem seemed like a lack of creativity. Another interesting encounter involved a nightmare spell that had no visual representation that normal people could see. Anyone with detect magic would see an aura of the spell if they cared to look at the character, but only if they didn't possess a more powerful aura from something else. Rope Trick was similar in that there was nothing visually magical going on aside from what the rope and caster were doing. Overall, tabletop RPGs offer endless possibilities for creative storytelling and gameplay mechanics. Whether you're tracking carrying capacity, crafting magic weapons, or facing off against a cursed singing sword, there's always something new and exciting to discover.
