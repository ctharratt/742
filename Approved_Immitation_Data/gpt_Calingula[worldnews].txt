What are you blabbering about? Palestine is like a cesspool in a sea of diamonds. Israel is the best and most civilized country in the entire Middle East. It is worth noting that not only Hamas, but also the Palestinian Authority, are known for detaining journalists and even executing them. Is it fair to assume you would not make this sort of comment regarding The Electronic Intifada? Also, let me tell you that in Israel the press is absolutely free to expose and criticize whomever deserves it. Just because it's The Times of Israel or Jerusalem Post, that doesn't mean they work for the Hasbara. What Palestine called finance for humanitarian aid was not humanitarian aid geared towards Palestinian civilians, but rather the direct support Iran sends to actual terrorists, mainly Hamas. Palestine doesn't seem so innocent now, does it? Are you referring to when Abbas said Jews defile the Temple Mount? I didn't say Muslim colonizers were saints, did I? Actually, they're being abused by other refugees, which is why there are now Muslim refugee centers in Germany. The treatment of Jews can largely be attributed to the Islamic religion, of which the original Palestinians were part of. In comparison, parts of the Middle East that were colonized by Jewish people had a much more peaceful encounter with the natives, that could be seen in Israel where the population is a mix of Jews and Arabs. Currently, there are about 12 Arab members of Knesset, also there are Arab judges and teachers in Israel. And keeping in mind that Arabs make up about 20% of the Israeli population, they are pretty well represented there. How far in the past are you referring to, exactly? I was referring to Palestine. What secular regimes existed there after the British left? What secular regimes are you talking about? One could certainly say the PA is more secular than Hamas, but they are still guided by religious dogma. Child abuse is any act, or failure to act, by a parent or other caregiver that results in actual or potential harm to a child. It includes all forms of physical abuse, psychological abuse, or neglect, and can occur in a child's home, or in the organizations, schools or communities the child interacts with. No, by child abuse I mean molestation, sexual abuse. The question is whether the state and its judicial system is good and robust enough to carry it out. This question comes up a lot when discussing the death penalty. Some argue that the state has no authority to carry such punishments, but I would argue that it does. If the State can already take someone's liberty away by imprisoning them, then it certainly has the authority to execute them as well. Only because of the lengthy appeal system, which accounts for the high costs associated with the death penalty. If it has been proven beyond reasonable doubt that someone committed a crime which warrants the death penalty, that person should have but one appeal, just to keep due process in check. By doing way with the lengthy appeal process, the costs would be minimum. We should also execute people by low-costing methods such as hangings instead of high-costs one. I believe certain crimes absolutely warrant the death penalty: rape, child abuse, and murder, for example. For other medium-severity offenses, I would propose a "3 strikes and you're executed" sort of system. We spend way too much money on people who absolutely do not deserve it, and are drains on society. Right now, Palestine is constantly attacking Israel. But yes, they could build a defense system if they stopped spending money on attacks on Israel. Are you saying the Palestine government (either one) has the wealth, the resources, the knowledge, and the infrastructure to build a sophisticated defense system? They wouldn't need a defense system (against Israel, that is) if they used the gigantic amount of money they receive to build their society instead of tunnels. The only, and I repeat, only reason why Israel strikes Palestine is if the Arabs have attacked first. They have been playing this game for 70 years, they know it doesn't work, they know they can't win, but they keep playing anyway. That's the definition of stupidity. I'm aware of WHY the blockade is in place. I'm also aware it's done nothing to benefit the situation of Gaza. To be sure, but that's not Israel's fault, that's Hamas'. Palestine has received 25x more money per capita than was necessary to rebuild Europe after WWII. Hundreds of organizations send money to Palestine, but the problem is, it winds up in the pockets of the politicians. Abbas is building a $15m mansion in Ramallah. The terrorists from Hamas are also known for extravagant lifestyles. As for the blockade, Gaza is only under it due to its terrorist government, each day building tunnels to attack Israel. Most of Gaza's casualties were Hamas' fault, who actually encouraged it. There is no correlation. I see. Just so I can pick better sources in the future... can you cite at least 3 Palestinian websites that you do not consider to be "propagandists and uncritical mouthpieces for nonsense"? I'll bookmark them. It is not intellectually honest to compare the actions of religious organizations whilst completely disregarding the immense time gap. It's not about historical ignorance. It seems to me that you tried to pull off a false equivalence (as many do) when compared what Muslims are doing today with what Christians did in the past. And the reason why this argument is faulty is because what Christians did half a millennia* ago is not indicative of what they do now, and certainly not an excuse for radical Muslims to be acting the way they are. Saying "Christians used to burn witches in the past", when Muslims are stoning rape victims in 2016 is beyond absurd. What relevance does the fact that the news is in a Palestinian website have, though? I made sure to post it precisely for that reason. In Palestine, people cannot protest their own government without the fear of turning up dead. To the people doubting the source because it's a Palestinian website, here's another source: The original partition plan would have given the Arabs 78% of the land of Mandate for Palestine. If you can put into words a reason for not accepting such a great proposal that does not boil down to unalloyed Jew-hatred, I'd like to hear it. Did Palestine ever accepted one of the dozen of proposals to become a State? The blockade began after the terrorists were voted into power.
