Man, I can't believe I fell for it. I thought XCOM: Enemy Within was on sale for only a dollar, but turns out it was just a misleading advertisement. Now I have two copies of Civ III and XCOM: Enemy Unknown. It's not a big deal though, I'm just feeling a bit nostalgic for the old days when games had small but detailed maps and could run on any computer. I remember playing the original Civilization game back in the day, and it was a blast. Nowadays, you can pick up any of the Civilization games on PC and they'll run on low-end computers, except maybe for Civ V. But I do miss the older versions of the game. They had a certain charm to them that the newer ones just don't have. Speaking of gaming, I love nearly every single gaming genre there is. I have a huge backlog of games that I need to play, and I like to organize them by when I'm going to play them. It's a great feeling to have a backlog of games waiting for you to play. It's like having a library of entertainment at your fingertips. One game that I'm really looking forward to is Borderlands 3. I'm preordering it for the story alone. I can't wait to see what kind of crazy adventures the characters get into this time around. But if you're looking for something to play right now, I highly recommend the Civilization series. They're great games that you can sink hours into, and they'll run on just about any computer. And if you're looking for something a bit more modern, there are plenty of great games out there like Alien: Isolation and Watch Dogs. If you're having trouble getting into a game, I recommend sitting down and making a list of all the games you have to play. Then organize them by when you're going to play them, and force yourself to play at least 15 minutes of each game. It's a great way to get started and get into the groove of playing. Alternatively, you can give me your list of games and I'll make a schedule for you. I love organizing things, and I'm always happy to help out a fellow gamer. One game that I played a couple of years ago that I really enjoyed was XCOM: Enemy Unknown. I was able to fight off an entire swarm of aliens due to precise timing, just like a certain character did in a certain episode of a certain season of a certain Telltale game. But then I stopped playing in fear of death. I guess you could call that canon suicide. A lot of people who grew up with modern games can't really enjoy XCOM: Enemy Unknown until they're reminded that it came out in 2012. It's a great game that's still worth playing today, especially if you're a fan of turn-based strategy games. Another game that I really enjoyed was Oblivion. It's an older game, but it's still a lot of fun to play. If you're new to the series, I recommend starting with The Mage's Guild or The Thieves Guild's line of quests. They're a great introduction to how the game is structured, and they take you to every single city in the game, exposing you to most of the interesting side quests. The main quest is okay, but unlike Skyrim's, there's no real reason to do it early. They do open up Oblivion gates around the world, which are extra dungeons with randomized but valuable loot at the end. If you're just starting out, make a save before you leave the tutorial dungeon so you can easily create new characters without having to go through it again. If you're looking for something a bit more modern, I recommend picking up Civilization V. It's a great game that's still worth playing today, especially if you're a fan of turn-based strategy games. And if you're looking for something a bit more challenging, try playing on the higher difficulty levels. It's a great way to test your skills and see how well you can do. Overall, there are plenty of great games out there to play. Whether you're a fan of turn-based strategy games or first-person shooters, there's something out there for everyone. So go out there and start playing!
