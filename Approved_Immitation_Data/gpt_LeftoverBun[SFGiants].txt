Honestly, I see someone like Hudson becoming a pitching coach. He has the experience and the knowledge to help young pitchers develop their skills and reach their full potential. Vogey, on the other hand, can be a bit hot-headed at times, but I think a lot of it depends on how well he gets along with Bochy. We've sent Bill Madlock there too, so it's not out of the realm of possibility. As for our current pitching staff, I don't have as much faith in Cueto or Samardzija. Most of the time when they sign one of our guys, they end up underperforming (Schmidt, Wilson, Mulholland). It's a shame, really, because they have the potential to be great. But until they prove themselves, I'll reserve my judgment. Speaking of underperforming, did anyone else catch that reporter's interview with the new hire? Yeah, she didn't make a great impression. She fits right in with the sports media world though... And how did the team do with Barry on it? Hmmmm? But I digress. Let's talk about that catch last night. Magnificent. It's moments like that that make me proud to be a Giants fan. And speaking of fans, aren't you quite the supportive one? Awesome, thanks so much. But can we talk about MLBTV for a second? It's not loading tonight for some reason. And I was really looking forward to watching Kelby Clark Kent and Wally Pip Pip Hooray! Maybe I should see if I can get a gig with Puig Destroyer instead. Oh, and did you know that if Byrd gets the cycle, it will make the Giants the all-time leading franchise with 24 cycles? They're currently tied with...The Pirates. Just browsing his stats is mind-blowing. I guess when a guy can hit 50 HRs every year, you make him play every day...but poor BoSox... Speaking of poor, did you see that guy get picked off first and still make it to second safely? That's just embarrassing. And don't even get me started on team names. Bullets? Really? Worse than Bullets. Let's hope they're extra athletic tonight. But back to the Giants. If they want to make the playoffs, they need to step up their game. And that means trading Mattingly as well. Sorry, not sorry. And can we talk about Blanco's insurance run? Bliss. Great job team! I just turned on the game and thought, "Aww, pitcher's up...oh wait, bet he hits an HR!" That never happens to me. And speaking of broadcasters, can we all agree that Kirk Reuter was the worst? I've never wanted to punch my TV so badly. But let's talk about something positive. Did anyone catch the last few rounds of that competition? The new format is great. A couple more things I'd like to see: 1) Place Chris Berman on the catcher's side of the pitcher's screen. 2) Map a color-coded grid in the outfield, and have the kids compete for points. There should be some great battles for balls hit into the high-value point zones. And can someone explain to me why deGrom was batting 8th? I can't listen or watch the game right now. "Yeah, but, you are aware that there's an invention called television, and on this invention they show shows, right?" Best kind of fan. Can't help but love what he's doing. But let's talk about something that's been on my mind for a while now. The superstar-type pitchers don't translate well, but the guys that do more charting keep their head in the game on non-pitching days. The only 3 I can think of in the last 40 years are Roger Craig, Tommy Lasorda, and Dallas Green. Edit: amazing to find out that Lasorda waited 20 years after his playing career was over to become a manager, and he won pennants in his first 2 seasons after taking over...what could have been? And speaking of players, did you know that while with CSN, he was known for: (1) being good at a young age, he left HS at 16 to go to CSN so he could enter MLB draft ASAP, (2) he played at CSN because they use wooden bats (unlike some college conferences), and he crushed CSN's HR record (he hit 31, the old record was 12), (3) he was ejected from his last game for arguing with ump. His team was in the JC World Series and he may have cost them the championship as he was suspended for their last game. But let's talk about something that affects all of us. MLB.com. Is it down for anyone else? I can't seem to access it. And even when I can, I'm blacked out for all California teams, which is why I have unlocator in the first place. Grrrr. But let's end on a positive note. That 9th team shutout of the season? WTG pitching staff! And even though he's lost a step, Vin Scully is still the greatest of all time. And even Vin Scully does too. I remember when Bryce Harper was called up a few years ago, Vin was giving background info and said he went to CS Northridge, when he actually attended College of Southern Nevada. He's definitely lost a step, but not to the point it distracts from the broadcasts IMHO. I do worry that it's something other than just old age creeping in. In conclusion, let's all root for our Giants and hope they make it to the playoffs. And let's hope that MLB.com gets its act together soon.
