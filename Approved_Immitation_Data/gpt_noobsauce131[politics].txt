Well, let me tell you something, folks. I've been reading up on this whole foreign policy thing and let me tell you, Bernie doesn't have a clue. Every time he's asked about it, he just starts talking about economics. And let me tell you, there's no consensus on whether his ideas are even possible to afford. People keep saying that, but I've never seen a source on it. And let me tell you, I don't think they really understand how debt works for countries. Now, some people might call me a realist, and let me tell you, that's just what the theory is called. But my point is simply that rights come from a government with the ability to give us those rights. And since there are no governments above countries, it doesn't make any sense to make an argument based on whether or not the US has any "right" to do anything. And let me tell you, I think we're in agreement more or less. Now, some people might say that oil is cheap because the region is unstable, but let me tell you, that's not the whole story. It happens to be cheap for other reasons, and it would be even cheaper if Iraq and Syria could supply oil too. And let me tell you, do you have a theory of international relations more useful than realism? Because there's a reason this armchair philosophy is the most used philosophy by international relations scholars. Now, some people might say that morals guide states, but let me tell you, that's not an answer. Trade is better when there's peace and stability. The price of oil rises when there's more war in the Middle East. And let me tell you, the US is bad at this. I'm not saying that's how things should be, I'm just saying that's how they are. Now, some people might say that ethics stop countries with big militaries from doing whatever they want, but let me tell you, that's just not true. It does both, peace benefits the US and peace and keeping dictators in power in the Middle East keeps peace. And let me tell you, this is such a naive comment. There are no rights in the world of international politics. Countries can do whatever they want unless some other countries can stop them. Now, some people might say that the US forced the UK to give up their invasion of Egypt, but let me tell you, that's not the whole story. It's Ferguson's book Empire that proposes the idea. He says America sends a message to the other colonies when they make the UK give up their invasion of Egypt due to the UK's increased reliance on its loans following WWII. Since the US won't allow the UK to defend their colonies, they have no choice but to let them go. And let me tell you, it wasn't willingly. Their economy was going down the shitter and they needed more loans from the US (the rising superpower) and the US basically told them they could have the loans if they lost the empire. Now, some people might say that a commission to examine defense spending is nothing, but let me tell you, it's likely that an examination like this would remove oversights and overspending, in the end limiting defense spending without actually lowering our military power. And let me tell you, not everything is some Hillary conspiracy. Now, some people might say that we need more radical leaders, but let me tell you, that's just not true. Moderation is the only thing that can make the game fair again (whatever that means). Nothing will be accomplished if both parties vote in more and more uncompromising, and more and more radical leaders. The Republicans should also be moderates. I've said that at least three times. The only way to change the system at all is with cooperation. You may have the best ideas in the world, but if the parties are too far away to cooperate, they won't get done. And let me tell you, I've been very clear in explaining my position. The only way I can see misunderstanding is if you think that moderate Democrats and Republicans = Tea Party. Now, some people might say that pushing the Democrats left is a good thing, but let me tell you, that's just not true. Pushing the Democrats left will further entrench the "my team vs your team" mentality that is happening currently. The treatment for congressional gridlock is more moderates on BOTH sides. And let me tell you, their thinking isn't EXACTLY like yours, they are different people. But they want their party to move more right the same way you want the Democrats to move more left. In the end, either movement will limit cooperation and therefore limit legislature. Now, some people might say that the US should just let China overtake us, but let me tell you, that's just not an option. China will ultimately translate that economic prosperity into military influence, and if China surpasses the US in both economics and military, there is no more reason for the countries in the region to be friendly to the US. We benefit economically from the fact that we are #1, and if we lose that position, then everyone in America will be hurt by it. And let me tell you, it isn't US leaders' jobs to take Chinese citizens out of poverty. Now, some people might say that pushing in the direction of war often isn't in the US's best interest, but let me tell you, when the options are either let China overtake the US or stand strong and stifle China's growth/very unlikely nuclear war, then the US should go with the latter. And let me tell you, that's just the way it is.
