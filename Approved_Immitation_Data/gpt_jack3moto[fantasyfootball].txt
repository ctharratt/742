I remember seeing a stat about four years ago that showed Purdue had the most passing yards in college football history, with Notre Dame and USC coming in second and third, respectively. However, the gap between Purdue and the other two schools was quite significant, with Purdue having 190,000 yards and Notre Dame only having 150,000. I'm not sure what the current stats are, but I imagine the gap has only widened since then. It's a shame that Purdue only has Drew Brees left to increase their total pass yards and potentially break any school records. After Brees, it's uncertain if they'll ever have anyone to grow that record. It's a reminder of how important it is to have a strong quarterback in college football. Speaking of football, I recently joined a work league with a buy-in of only $20. I kept bugging the league commissioner to collect money before it got too late, but in the end, only myself and three other people coughed up the $20. It's not a lot of money, so I'm not too upset, but it's frustrating that six people didn't pay at all. I almost wanted to not pay, but the guy who won deserved (and probably needed) the money. As a commissioner myself, I usually collect money before inviting people to the league, but this is my first year in my work league, so I just went with the flow. My team looks like garbage, but I somehow made it to the finals. My QB is Joe Flacco, and my RBs are Rashad Jennings, CJ Anderson, and Tre Mason. My WRs are Demaryius Thomas, Randall Cobb, and Deandre Hopkins, and my TE is Jimmy Graham. My defense is the Dolphins, and my kicker is Cody Parkey. It's a standard 10-man ESPN league. I messed up by not listening to anyone and playing Mason as my RB2 instead of Jennings. Anderson was my RB1. For my flex options, I have Jennings, Hopkins, Sammy Watkins, Jordan Matthews, and Coby Fleener. I'm hoping for 12-14 points from Mason tonight, but I'm not sure if he'll be a red zone back or if St. Louis will even get into the red zone often. He had nearly 30 carries in the week prior to Washington, so they may have wanted to reduce his workload on purpose. I'm going to roll with Mason tonight, but I might play Jennings in my flex as well. I just need about 12-14 points from Mason to be extraordinarily pleased. For my flex pick 2, I'm considering Hopkins, Mason, Jennings, Fleener, Watkins, and Matthews. It's a standard 10-man ESPN league. I'm leading 133-81 in my 2-week semi-final matchup, and I can't decide between my RBs. All of them went beast mode last week for me, but if I put one as my flex, I'll have to sit either Hopkins, Thomas, or Cobb. I had Benjamin on a bye, Foster is injured, and Dwayne Allen is injured. It's the last week, and it's win for playoffs or lose and go home. I'm worried about Foster's injury and whether he'll be able to handle his normal workload if he does play. If he's ruled out, that's fine, but I don't want to see them splitting carries 40/60 or 50/50. I mean, last year teams knew they could give up big plays here and there because the other 95% of plays were little to no gain. Now, you have to do the reverse. Can't let Gordon deep will be a higher priority than stacking 8 in the box. I think if anything, this dramatically helps the Browns' run game and will lead to their RBs racking up a lot more yards. I agree, but could this hurt Gordon? Opponents could focus on stopping the run and blitzing a lot more, knowing that the QB's only help would be a Josh Gordon throw. Now, teams will make sure Josh Gordon isn't beating them deep because games will be much closer. Also, with Cleveland playing well, will they need to lean on him as much as they did last year, or could we see the ball spread out more? I wouldn't say his numbers will decrease a ton, but instead of getting 7 receptions with 11 targets, maybe we'll see more along the lines of 4-5 receptions with 7-9 targets? Last week, I made a trade to sure up my TE position by trading Denard Robinson for Dwayne Allen. However, Allen put up a goose egg, and I have Mychael Rivera on the bench. I thought it was a solid move to strengthen my TE position before playoffs, but now I may have just lost out on a solid Flex RB. Overall, fantasy football can be a frustrating game, but it's also a lot of fun. It's important to have a strong QB and RBs, but it's also crucial to have a solid TE and Flex options. It's a game of strategy and luck, and sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry.
