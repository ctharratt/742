If there's one thing that's become abundantly clear in recent years, it's that political correctness has become the norm. It's almost as if people are afraid to speak their minds for fear of offending someone. But what about those who proudly proclaim their politically incorrectness? Are they simply pandering to a certain audience, or are they genuinely expressing their beliefs? The truth is, it's hard to say. On the one hand, there are certainly those who use politically incorrect language and ideas as a way to appeal to a certain demographic. They know that there are people out there who are tired of being told what they can and can't say, and they use that frustration to their advantage. But on the other hand, there are also those who genuinely believe that political correctness has gone too far. They feel that people are too easily offended these days, and that we need to be able to have honest conversations about difficult topics without worrying about hurting someone's feelings. Of course, the problem with this is that what one person considers "honest conversation" another person might consider hate speech. It's a delicate balance, and one that we as a society are still struggling to find. But the fact that political correctness has become so mainstream is a sign that we're moving in the right direction. It means that people are becoming more aware of the impact that their words and actions can have on others, and that they're starting to take responsibility for that impact. But while political correctness may be a step in the right direction, it's not a panacea. There are still plenty of issues that we need to address as a society, and simply being politically correct isn't going to solve them. Take terrorism, for example. In recent years, ISIS has become synonymous with terrorism in the minds of many Americans. But what about other terrorist groups, like al-Qaeda? When ISIS falls, it's likely that al-Qaeda will step up to take its place. And what about lone wolf attacks, like the one that happened in San Bernardino? Restricting the internet isn't going to stop those kinds of attacks from happening. And speaking of San Bernardino, what about the debate over gun control? It seems like every time there's a mass shooting, the same arguments get trotted out on both sides. Gun control advocates say that we need stricter laws to prevent these kinds of tragedies from happening, while gun rights advocates say that the problem isn't guns, it's mental illness. But the truth is, both sides have a point. We do need to do more to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them, but we also need to address the underlying issues that lead people to commit these kinds of acts in the first place. But while we're on the topic of politics, let's talk about Bernie Sanders. At first, he was hailed as a "clean candidate" who refused to sling mud. But now that he's making "flat out accusations," he's being hailed as courageous for standing up. Personally, I don't agree with campaign contributions or bribery, but it's hard for me to take this sub seriously when the man can do no wrong. It makes me wary of the hype. And while we're on the topic of being wary, let's talk about single moms. I've heard people say that you should never hook up with a single mom because you never know where she stands on abortion. But the truth is, there are plenty of single moms out there who are pro-choice. And even if they're not, that doesn't mean that they're going to try to trap you into a relationship or force you to be a father. It's important to remember that single moms are people too, and they deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. But let's move on to a more serious topic: antibiotic resistance. Overuse of antibiotics has been proven to increase resistance genes in bacterial pathogens, and China (and Denmark) has been using a "last resort" antibiotic on its chickens and livestock, increasing the antibiotic resistant bacteria population. This is a serious issue that we need to address as a society, because if we don't, we could be facing a future where even the most basic infections are untreatable. And speaking of things we need to address, let's talk about the corrupt system that we're forced to operate in. When you demonize that system, you have to expect an uphill battle. Even if you completely count out the Republicans, Bernie Sanders still doesn't win. He doesn't even beat out Hillary. And wait until he doesn't make it onto the ballot. After the election, all you'll see on r/politics is how "this election could've been different if more people showed up to vote....... :(" But let's end on a positive note. Despite all of the challenges that we face as a society, there are still plenty of reasons to be hopeful. We're making progress on issues like marriage equality and transgender rights, and we're starting to have more honest conversations about race and privilege. We still have a long way to go, but if we keep moving forward, we can create a world that's more just and equitable for everyone.
