Alright, let's talk about this post. First of all, I have no idea what "white people problems" they're referring to. Are they talking about the fact that white people have to deal with the sunburn more often? Or maybe they're talking about the fact that white people have to deal with the societal pressure to conform to certain beauty standards? Either way, I'm not sure what fixing those problems would entail. And then they bring up the fact that there are no videos of Obama proving he's not a lizard person. I mean, sure, there aren't any videos of me proving that I'm not a lizard person either, but that doesn't mean I am one. It's a ridiculous conspiracy theory that has no basis in reality. But then they bring up Steve Irwin being killed by a stingray. That's just sad. I remember watching his show as a kid and being fascinated by all the animals he encountered. It's a shame that he died doing what he loved. And then they accuse the post of being a ploy to garner karma. I mean, maybe it is, but who cares? It's just internet points. It's not like they're worth anything in the real world. And then they start talking about cutting off fingers before chucking someone in a hole. That's just messed up. I don't even want to know what kind of situation would warrant that kind of violence. And then they make a joke about "pi rate." I mean, I guess it's kind of funny, but it's also a bit of a stretch. And then they mention that they're getting old. I feel that. Time just keeps moving forward, whether we like it or not. And then they admit that they have no idea what someone means by "rapper." I mean, I guess not everyone is into hip hop, but it's a pretty well-known genre at this point. And then they thank someone for dealing with all the crap in the world so that our system doesn't collapse. I'm not sure who they're referring to specifically, but I guess it's nice to show appreciation for people who work hard to keep things running smoothly. And then they give some questionable medical advice about clotty boners. I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure that's not how you're supposed to handle that situation. And then they make a comment about Canadians. I'm not sure what their problem is with Canadians, but as a Canadian myself, I take offense to that. And then they mention something about a stoned comedian reading live tweets at his shows. I'm not sure who they're talking about, but it sounds like it could be entertaining. And then they give some advice about not getting into car accidents. I mean, that's good advice in general, but it's not always something you can control. And then they make a comment about self-love. I mean, I guess it's important to take care of yourself, but maybe not in that way. And then they make a joke about their other car being a horse. I mean, I guess that would be a pretty eco-friendly mode of transportation, but it's not exactly practical for most people. And then they mention Lemmewinks having cousins. I'm not sure who Lemmewinks is, but I'm assuming it's some kind of animal. And then they make a comment about not needing a backup band. I'm not sure what they're referring to specifically, but I guess some people prefer to perform solo. And then they start rambling about Ronald Reagan and turning left when it's cold outside. I'm not sure what the connection is there, but I guess they're just letting their thoughts wander. And then they give some advice about recording your own alarm sounds. I mean, I guess that's a good way to make sure you wake up on time, but it also seems like it could be annoying to listen to the same sound every morning. And then they make a reference to Jaws. I mean, I guess that's a classic movie, but I'm not sure what it has to do with anything. And then they make a comment about a calloused dick. I mean, I guess that's one way to prevent chafing, but it doesn't sound very comfortable. And then they give some directions for finding a farmhouse with a good internet connection. I'm not sure why they're so obsessed with finding fast internet, but I guess it's important to some people. And then they start talking about Shamu and shampoo. I'm not sure what the connection is there, but I guess it's a play on words. And then they give some advice about cutting bananas. I mean, I guess that's a good way to make sure they don't get bruised, but it also seems like a lot of effort. And then they start talking about the difference between fruits and vegetables. I mean, I guess it's interesting to know the botanical definition, but most people just use the culinary definition. And then they make a comment about how profitable something is. I'm not sure what they're referring to specifically, but I guess it's a good thing if something is profitable. And then they make a reference to Pokemon. I mean, I guess that's a popular franchise, but I'm not sure what it has to do with anything. And then they make a comment about a "metare-post." I'm not sure what that means, but I guess it's some kind of meta commentary on the post itself. And then they start talking about the brain and social media. I mean, I guess it's true that social media can have a negative impact on our mental health, but it's also a powerful tool for connecting with others. And then they make a comment about "accidental" lawsuits. I'm not sure what they're referring to specifically, but I guess it's a reference to people suing for frivolous reasons. And then they give some advice about using Android Pay. I mean, I guess it's a convenient way to pay for things, but it also seems like it could be a security risk. And then they make a reference to Jaws again. I'm not sure why they're so obsessed with that movie, but I guess it's a classic for a reason. And then they make a comment about turning a plastic bag inside out. I mean, I guess it's a good analogy for understanding the concept of inside out, but it's also kind of confusing. And then they make a comment about hygiene. I mean, I guess it's important to practice good hygiene, but it's also something that a lot of people struggle with. And then they make a comment about evolution being a commercial for shampoo. I mean, I guess it's a funny way to look at it, but it's also kind of reductive. And then they make a comment about reverse Satanism. I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds like some kind of joke. And then they make a comment about Tumblr. I'm not sure why they're bringing up Tumblr specifically, but I guess it's a popular social media platform. And then they make a comment about fixing a typo. I mean, I guess it's important to proofread your writing, but it's also something that a lot of people overlook. And then they make a reference to Pineapple. I'm not sure what that's about, but I guess it's some kind of inside joke. And then they make a comment about fruit juice and pollen. I mean, I guess it's an interesting comparison, but it's also kind of gross. And then they make a comment about blinking and scratching. I mean, I guess those are both things that we do unconsciously, but it's also kind of weird to think about. And then they make a comment about people of Walmart. I'm not sure what they're referring to specifically, but I guess it's some kind of meme or joke. Overall, this post is a bit all over the place. There are some funny moments, but there are also a lot of random tangents that don't really add anything to the conversation. It's entertaining to read, but it's not exactly insightful or informative.
