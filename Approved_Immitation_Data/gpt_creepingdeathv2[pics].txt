I call bullshit! Why the hell are we still talking about this? It's been years since this issue was brought up and yet we're still debating it. It's time to move on and focus on more pressing matters. I understand that some people may have strong opinions on this topic, but let's be real here. There are more important things to worry about than whether or not we should implement this solution. We need to focus on issues that affect the majority of the population, not just a small minority. Sure, there may be some benefits to this solution, but at what cost? Is it really worth the time and resources to implement something that may only benefit a small percentage of people? We need to be practical and realistic in our approach to problem-solving. Furthermore, the argument that "just because 10 people in 100 people get left out, does not mean the other 90 people also should not benefit from a good idea" is flawed. We should not be implementing solutions that only benefit a small percentage of people while ignoring the needs of the majority. It's time to stop relying on anecdotal evidence and start looking at the data. We need to base our decisions on facts and statistics, not just personal experiences. This is especially important when it comes to policy-making. And let's not forget about the potential consequences of implementing this solution. It may seem like a good idea on the surface, but what about the unintended consequences? We need to consider all possible outcomes before making a decision. In conclusion, it's time to move on from this topic and focus on more important issues. We need to be practical and realistic in our approach to problem-solving and base our decisions on facts and statistics. Let's not get caught up in anecdotal evidence and personal experiences. It's time to make decisions that benefit the majority, not just a small minority.
