Silent Plant: The New Thing Have you ever been playing The Last of Us multiplayer and found yourself frustrated by the constant barrage of tactics used by other players? The shiv on the staircase in Bills Town, the tac/shorty corner shooting, the bomb and explosion expert abuse, the endless camping with covert 3, and the underrated power of the launcher. It can all be overwhelming and make you want to throw your controller across the room. But fear not, my fellow survivors, for I have discovered the new thing that will revolutionize the way we play: the silent plant. Picture this: you're in a heated battle with the enemy team, trying to capture a supply box. You've managed to take out a few of them, but they keep respawning and coming back stronger. You need a new strategy, something unexpected. That's when you remember the silent plant. The silent plant is a technique where you plant a bomb without making any noise. It's a game-changer because it catches your enemies off guard. They won't hear the usual beeping sound that alerts them to a bomb's presence, and they won't see the red light flashing on the bomb. They'll walk right into it, thinking they're safe, and BOOM! You've got them. But how do you do a silent plant, you ask? It's simple. First, equip the bomb expert perk. This will allow you to plant bombs faster and without making any noise. Then, find a good spot to plant your bomb. It could be behind a corner, in a doorway, or even in the middle of a room. Just make sure it's somewhere your enemies won't expect it. Once you've found your spot, crouch down and start planting the bomb. Make sure you're hidden from view and that no one is around to see or hear you. It only takes a few seconds to plant the bomb, so be quick and efficient. Once the bomb is planted, back away slowly and wait for your enemies to walk into it. You can even use a smoke bomb to disorient them and make it harder for them to see the bomb. When they do walk into it, they'll be caught off guard and won't know what hit them. The silent plant is a great way to turn the tide of a battle and catch your enemies off guard. It's also a lot of fun to use and can be very satisfying when it works. So next time you're playing The Last of Us multiplayer, give the silent plant a try. You might just surprise yourself and your enemies. In other news, I haven't played The Last of Us in about two or three weeks. I've been having fun messing around on Destiny and playing the Uncharted 4 beta. But I'll likely be back when the beta ends this Sunday. I miss the thrill of the multiplayer and the satisfaction of taking out my enemies with a well-placed bomb or shiv. Speaking of shivs, have you ever heard of the crafty shiv or the backpack shiv? These are two other techniques that can be very effective in The Last of Us multiplayer. The crafty shiv allows you to craft a shiv without making any noise, while the backpack shiv allows you to carry an extra shiv in your backpack. Both of these techniques can be very useful in certain situations, so it's worth giving them a try. And while we're on the topic of multiplayer tactics, let's talk about the tac/shorty corner shooting. This is a tactic that can be very frustrating to play against, but it's also very effective. The tac shotgun is a powerful weapon up close, and when combined with the shorty, it can be deadly. The key to using this tactic is to stay hidden and wait for your enemies to come to you. When they do, pop out and shoot them with the tac/shorty combo. It's a cheap tactic, but it works. Another frustrating tactic is the endless camping with covert 3. This is when a player uses the covert training perk to stay hidden from their enemies. They'll crouch walk around the map, staying hidden and waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. It can be very annoying to play against, but it's also a valid strategy. The key to countering this tactic is to stay alert and keep moving. Don't stay in one place for too long, or you'll become an easy target. Finally, let's talk about the launcher. This is a weapon that is often underrated in The Last of Us multiplayer. It's a powerful weapon that can take out multiple enemies at once, especially when aimed at the ground. It's also very easy to use, which makes it a popular choice among players. The key to countering the launcher is to stay out of its range and keep moving. Don't let your enemies get too close to you, or you'll be blown to bits. In conclusion, The Last of Us multiplayer can be frustrating at times, but it's also a lot of fun. There are many tactics and techniques that can be used to gain an advantage over your enemies, but the silent plant is the new thing that will change the game. Give it a try and see for yourself. And remember, stay alert, keep moving, and don't let your enemies get the best of you.
