Hey there! I see you have some questions about getting a pilot's degree in Canada. Well, let me tell you, it's not a simple answer. The length of time it takes to get a pilot's degree in Canada can vary depending on a few factors. Firstly, it depends on the type of pilot's license you want to obtain. There are three main types of pilot's licenses in Canada: the Private Pilot License (PPL), the Commercial Pilot License (CPL), and the Airline Transport Pilot License (ATPL). The PPL is the most basic license and allows you to fly for personal reasons, while the CPL and ATPL allow you to fly for commercial purposes. The PPL typically takes around 6-12 months to complete, while the CPL can take anywhere from 12-18 months. The ATPL is the most advanced license and can take up to 2 years to complete. However, it's important to note that these timeframes can vary depending on the individual's pace of learning and the flight school they attend. Another factor that can affect the length of time it takes to get a pilot's degree in Canada is the type of aircraft you want to fly. There are different categories of aircraft, such as single-engine, multi-engine, and helicopters. Each category requires a different type of license and training, which can affect the length of time it takes to obtain a pilot's degree. As for the planes themselves, they can be either original or reproductions. Many flight schools use modern aircraft, such as Cessnas and Pipers, which are original planes. However, some flight schools may use older planes that have been restored or rebuilt, which could be considered reproductions. Now, onto your question about customers thinking you're trying to scam them. As a pilot, I haven't had any experiences with customers thinking I'm trying to scam them. However, I have heard of instances where customers have had negative experiences with flight schools or instructors. It's important to do your research and choose a reputable flight school with experienced instructors to avoid any potential issues. As for your question about robbing a bank, I'm not sure where that came from, but I can assure you that I have never robbed a bank. Let's move on to your question about selling knives. I'm not sure how that's related to getting a pilot's degree, but I'll answer it anyway. I have never sold knives, but I imagine it would require some basic sales skills and knowledge of the product. It's important to understand the features and benefits of the knives you're selling and be able to communicate them effectively to potential customers. In conclusion, the length of time it takes to get a pilot's degree in Canada can vary depending on the type of license and aircraft you want to fly. It's important to choose a reputable flight school with experienced instructors to ensure a positive learning experience. And just to clarify, I have never robbed a bank.
