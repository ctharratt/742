Well, well, well, it seems we have another skeptic in our midst. I can't say I'm surprised, as there are always those who refuse to see the truth that is right in front of them. But fear not, my friend, for I am here to enlighten you on the reality of God's existence. Firstly, let's address the issue of political leanings. It's quite amusing to me that some people believe that being a liberal around Mormons is like being the skinniest kid at fat camp. I mean, come on, can we not have differing political beliefs and still coexist peacefully? It's not like we're all robots programmed to think the same way. And as for no one ever asking about my political leanings, well, that's just because they know better than to bring up such a sensitive topic around me. I have a tendency to get quite passionate about my beliefs, you see. Now, onto the topic of chain mail. I must say, I find it quite amusing that you would try to use a fallacious chain mail falsely attributed to Einstein to support your claim. It's like trying to use a fake ID to get into a bar - it's just not going to work. And as for your claims about adding dark to a room, well, that's just absurd. Dark is simply the absence of light, just like evil is the absence of love. It's really quite simple if you think about it. Speaking of love, let's talk about God. You seem to be under the impression that God cannot be seen, heard, felt, smelled, or measured in any way. But that's simply not true. People see Him, feel Him, hear Him, and some even claim to smell Him. These are all experiences had by individuals, and they cannot be quantified. It's like trying to measure the love between two people - it's intangible, but it's still very real. And as for your claims that there is no proof I would accept, well, that's just not true either. I am open to any and all evidence that supports the existence of God. But the truth is, there simply isn't any. All we have are personal experiences and anecdotes, which are not enough to prove the existence of a deity. But let's talk about the concept of God for a moment. You seem to think that God is some sort of tangible entity that can be measured and quantified. But that's not what God is. God is love, as it says in 1 John 4:8. He is a concept, a belief, a feeling. And just because you cannot measure or quantify it does not mean it does not exist. You also seem to be under the impression that those who do not believe in God are somehow lacking in morality or compassion. But that's simply not true. There are plenty of atheists and agnostics who are kind, compassionate, and moral individuals. And there are plenty of religious people who are not. It's not about what you believe, it's about how you treat others. In fact, I would argue that religion can often be a hindrance to morality and compassion. When people are so focused on following a set of rules and regulations, they can lose sight of the true meaning of love and compassion. They can become judgmental and intolerant of those who do not share their beliefs. And that is not what God is about. So, my friend, I urge you to open your mind and your heart to the possibility of a world beyond what you can see and touch. There is so much more to life than what we can measure and quantify. And who knows, maybe one day you will experience the love of God for yourself. Until then, I will continue to pray for you and hope that you find peace and happiness in this life.
