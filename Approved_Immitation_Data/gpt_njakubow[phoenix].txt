Hey there, folks! Let's dive right in, shall we? First up, let's talk about the crowds. I went to an event last year and let me tell you, there were A LOT of kids there. If you're looking for something a bit more low-key, I highly recommend checking out the Botanical Garden. Sure, it might be a bit pricier, but the atmosphere is perfect for a date night. And if you're in the mood for a scenic drive, why not take a spin through Black Carl? Just be warned, the 101 exits can be a bit dicey. Now, if you're looking to get out of the city and hit up a brewery, I highly recommend heading up to Pine and checking out THAT Brewery. Say hi to Tamara and Steve for me! And while you're up there, make sure to stop by Tonto Natural Bridge. It's a bit of a hike, but totally worth it. And if you're feeling adventurous, Water Wheel and West Clear Creek Canyon are both great spots to explore. Speaking of hikes, have you guys checked out Siphon Draw or Massacre Falls? Both are super fun trails that every Arizona resident should experience at least once. And if you're feeling really brave, why not plan your own hike? Just make sure to check out the Facebook page for any events or updates. Now, let's talk about some recent news. I was pretty bummed to hear that Krispy Kreme closed up without notice, but at least they eventually came back. And while I'm sad to see the Camelback store go, I'm excited to see what America's Taco Shop has in store. And speaking of food, have you guys tried any of the burrito places around town? I consider myself quite the burrito fan, but I've yet to try any of them. And let's not forget about sports! I'm pumped for this season, especially after that 15 hit game. And if you're looking to catch a game, I recommend taking the 51 to Camelback. Traffic is usually pretty easy since everyone is heading the opposite direction. And if you're feeling really adventurous, why not head up to Havasupai? It's an amazing spot that I haven't been to in years, but am lucky enough to be visiting this summer. Now, let's talk about some recent events. Did anyone else experience that power outage? I live on Mill and Broadway and saw the flash, but thankfully it was only for a second. And speaking of Mill, did anyone else get caught in that traffic jam? A semi tipped over and exploded, sending debris across all lanes of traffic. It was a mess, but thankfully it's all cleared up now. And finally, let's talk about the weather. I was up in Payson a few weeks ago and we got 6 inches of snow. And apparently Tonto Natural Bridge got 8 inches this morning! If you're looking to play in some real snow, I recommend taking a drive up to Pine, Payson, or even up to the Mogollon Rim. Well, that's all for now, folks! Thanks for tuning in to my ramblings. Until next time, keep exploring all that Arizona has to offer!
