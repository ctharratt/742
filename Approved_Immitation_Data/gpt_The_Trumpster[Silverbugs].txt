Post US 1964 coins are a topic of great interest to me. As a collector and investor in precious metals, I have spent countless hours researching and studying the history and composition of these coins. One of the most fascinating aspects of post 1964 coins is the fact that they are made of an alloy that specifically has the same conductivity as pre 1964 coins. This is significant because pre 1964 coins were made of 90% silver and 10% copper, while post 1964 coins are made of a copper-nickel alloy. The reason for this change in composition was due to the rising cost of silver in the 1960s. The US government realized that it was no longer economically feasible to continue producing coins made of 90% silver, so they made the switch to a cheaper alloy. However, they wanted to ensure that the new coins would still be easily recognizable and accepted by the public. So, they made sure that the new alloy had the same conductivity as the old silver coins. This meant that vending machines and other coin-operated devices would still be able to recognize and accept the new coins. This was a smart move on the part of the government, as it helped to prevent confusion and ensure that the new coins would be widely accepted. It also helped to maintain the value of the coins, as they were still seen as a reliable form of currency. Of course, as a collector and investor in precious metals, I am more interested in the value of the coins as a commodity than as a form of currency. And in this regard, post 1964 coins are still a valuable investment. While they may not be made of silver, they are still made of a valuable metal (nickel) and are still recognized as legal tender. This means that they can be bought and sold just like any other coin, and their value is determined by a variety of factors, including their rarity, condition, and historical significance. One thing that I find particularly interesting about post 1964 coins is the fact that they are still in circulation today. This means that they are still being used as currency, and are still being collected and traded by collectors and investors alike. Of course, not all post 1964 coins are created equal. Some are more valuable than others, depending on a variety of factors. For example, some coins may be rare due to low mintage numbers, while others may be valuable due to their historical significance or unique design. As a collector and investor, it is important to do your research and understand the factors that determine the value of post 1964 coins. This includes understanding the history and composition of the coins, as well as their rarity, condition, and other factors. One thing that I have learned over the years is that the value of post 1964 coins can fluctuate greatly depending on market conditions. For example, during times of economic uncertainty or inflation, the value of precious metals tends to rise, which can drive up the value of post 1964 coins. On the other hand, during times of economic stability or deflation, the value of precious metals tends to fall, which can drive down the value of post 1964 coins. This is why it is important to stay up-to-date on market conditions and adjust your investment strategy accordingly. In addition to post 1964 coins, I am also passionate about other forms of precious metals, including silver, gold, and platinum. I believe that these metals are a valuable investment for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio and protect their wealth. Of course, investing in precious metals is not without its risks. Like any investment, there is always the possibility of loss, and it is important to do your research and understand the risks before investing. However, I believe that the potential rewards of investing in precious metals far outweigh the risks. Not only do these metals have intrinsic value, but they also have a long history of being used as a store of wealth and a hedge against inflation. In conclusion, post 1964 coins are a fascinating and valuable investment for collectors and investors alike. While they may not be made of silver, they are still recognized as legal tender and are still widely collected and traded. As with any investment, it is important to do your research and understand the risks before investing, but I believe that the potential rewards of investing in precious metals are well worth the effort.
