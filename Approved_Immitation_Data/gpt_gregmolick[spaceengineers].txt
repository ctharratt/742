Ahoy there, fellow space engineers! Today, I want to talk about pirate bases and how they only seem to appear in easy start scenarios. Now, I know some of you may have started in creative mode and deleted the easy start base and ships before switching to survival mode, like I did. But for those who started on a planet with pirates, it can be a real challenge to deal with those pesky drones that keep spawning. One idea I had was to have the drones spawn by the welders and only when the welders are destroyed will they stop spawning. It seems like a waste to have all those cool welders on a ship and not have them serve any purpose other than building. I even tried taking out the welders on the Argentavis, but the drones kept coming. Maybe this is something that could be implemented in a future update? Speaking of updates, I keep hearing people mention a mod called "Speed Mod." Can someone explain to me what it does? I've had trouble getting speed mods to work for me, so I had to manually change the max speed. If anyone else is having this issue, just search "change max speed space engineers" on Reddit and a post should come up with instructions. Now, let's talk about lights. They're completely pointless if you're not within 20 blocks of them. At night, I find myself flying blindly to my GPS waypoint and only seeing my base's small patch of light when I'm close enough to the ground. It would be great if the lights had a larger range or if we could adjust their brightness. Moving on to inventory management, the assemblers and refineries are the worst when it comes to organization. The inventories are listed in seemingly random order, with refinery 1, 2, 9, 3, 7, 6, 5, 8, and 4 all spread apart by other non-important inventories. It would be helpful if we could rearrange the order or group them together based on their function. Starting on a planet with pirates can be a real challenge, but it's also exciting. I started on an easy start Earth in creative mode and deleted the base before spawning in a planetary lander and switching to survival mode. But I do wish there was an easier way to start on a planet with pirates without having to resort to easy start scenarios. One thing I hate is when I don't have enough supplies to rebuild. I once traveled 50km with my ship to find a new home on Earth, only to realize I forgot the construction components. I loaded up a container while docked to a connector on Earth, but didn't realize I didn't have enough thrust to lift off the ground. I disconnected and immediately plummeted through my large base, leaving a giant hole all the way through to a crater below. My ship went through the metal platforms and equipment like a hot knife through butter. But things are starting to move along for me now. I just completed a large drill ship with 5 rows of 9 drills covering the bottom, spread out one block space in between each row. I just mined 300k worth of iron in 5 minutes. It used to take me 3 minutes, but now I play Abduction on Android while it loads. I think starting in creative mode and getting used to ship mechanics is a great way to get started in Space Engineers. My brother started in creative mode and spent an hour building a small ship before we copied and pasted it for dog fights. He caught the Space Engineers bug by seeing what he was capable of in ship building. I tell him about my struggles in survival mode and it only intrigues him more. Speaking of survival mode, I've seen some people here saying that if we were to add breeding to the game, we would have to redesign all of our ships. But it wouldn't be mandatory if it were optional. I haven't touched breeding since starting Space Engineers months ago, but I thought some people might want to try it when they hit a creative roadblock. Now, let's talk about mining. I prefer to do it by hand, making a simple cargo vehicle and driving it to an ore spot. I crouch and start digging directly below me, setting a GPS waypoint when I see a hint of the ore. That's the challenge. It's much easier to mine ores in space, so you're encouraged to lift off the planet. When it comes to flying on a planet, make sure to check your power usage if you're having trouble lifting off the ground. You need a lot of small reactors or batteries if that's what you're using. And if you're not lifting off the ground but you have plenty of thrusters, check your power usage. One more thing about planets: connect an air vent to your cockpit or a conveyor that's connected to your cockpit. Press J to put your helmet on before entering, then go to the control panel with K and set air vents to depressurize. Now you can get out, take off your helmet, and get back in without suffocating. If you're having trouble with your drill ship, try using a medium cargo container to transition from small conveyors to large ones. And if you're looking to mine a large circular hole, try using a rotor to connect a drill array in the center of your ship. My drill ships are getting better and better, and I'm starting to see the benefits of using them over hand drills. Finally, if you're looking for a break from Space Engineers, check out Space Engine. It's a free space sim that's absolutely gorgeous. It has every known star, galaxy, etc. in our universe, and on top of that, they procedurally generated an infinite number of new stars, galaxies, etc. You can fly right up to the surface of a planet or star, and the planets and moons have very detailed and unique terrain. Well, that's all for now, fellow space engineers. If anyone wants to play together, my Steam name is Tragedia and I have the picture of pirate Jesus as my icon. And remember, when in doubt, crouch to dig straight down!
