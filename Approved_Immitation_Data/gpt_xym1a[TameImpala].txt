Hey there! Sorry for the delay, but I finally got around to editing the tab so that the two objects are moving away from each other. I hope it sounds better now! By the way, I saw you perform live at Manifestasol last year and it was sick! Your music is amazing and I'm glad I got to experience it in person. As for the tab, I think it sounds pretty close to the original, but I'm not sure if the artist plays power chords. If you don't have all the effects available, adding power chords could be a good way to add more texture to the sound. However, I would recommend checking out Sumjor's cover on his channel, as he did a pretty good job with it. I could even tab it out for you later if you're interested. Speaking of effects, have you tried experimenting with different pedals or plugins? I've found that adding a delay or reverb effect can really enhance the sound and make it more dynamic. Of course, it all depends on the style of music you're playing and the specific sound you're going for. In terms of technique, have you tried using alternate picking or sweep picking? These techniques can help you play faster and more efficiently, which is especially useful for more complex pieces. It takes some practice to get the hang of it, but it's definitely worth it in the end. Another thing to consider is the tuning of your guitar. Have you tried experimenting with different tunings, such as drop D or open G? This can really change the sound and feel of your playing, and can even inspire new ideas and melodies. Of course, all of these things are just suggestions and it's ultimately up to you to decide what works best for your music. The most important thing is to keep practicing and experimenting, and to never stop learning and growing as a musician. Anyway, I hope this tab helps and that you continue to create amazing music. Keep rocking!
