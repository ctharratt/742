I don't know about you, but I find the concept of circlejerks to be both fascinating and frustrating. On one hand, it's interesting to see how certain opinions and ideas can become so popular and widespread that they seem to take on a life of their own. On the other hand, it can be incredibly frustrating to see people blindly following these opinions without really thinking critically about them. But what exactly is a circlejerk? Well, in its most basic form, a circlejerk is a group of people who all share the same opinion and spend their time reinforcing that opinion through discussion, memes, and other forms of communication. The term is often used in a derogatory way to describe groups of people who are seen as being closed-minded or unwilling to consider alternative viewpoints. Of course, not all circlejerks are bad. Sometimes, it can be helpful to have a group of like-minded individuals who can provide support and validation for your ideas. But when a circlejerk becomes too insular and resistant to outside perspectives, it can become a problem. One of the most frustrating things about circlejerks is that they can be incredibly difficult to break out of. Once an idea or opinion becomes popular, it can be hard to convince people to think differently. This is especially true in the age of social media, where algorithms and echo chambers can reinforce existing beliefs and make it even harder to consider alternative viewpoints. But despite the challenges, it's important to keep trying to break out of circlejerks and engage with different perspectives. After all, it's only through open-minded discussion and debate that we can truly grow and learn. Speaking of learning, did you know that the French phrase "Sacré bleu" was originally used as a euphemism for "Sacré Dieu", which translates to "Holy God"? This was because "Sacré Dieu" was considered to be extremely strong language, similar to how "holy cow" is used in place of "holy shit". Even "Sacré bleu" remains seldom used as it too is considered a very strong term. But let's move on from language and talk about something a bit more interesting: bears. Did you know that North America used to have diverse and abundant megafauna across the continent, which rivaled that of Africa and Asia today? There were California condors in New York, reindeer were as far south as Tennessee, and the great plains had its own species of cheetah (not a true cheetah, but a big cat that evolved very similar to Afro/Asiatic cheetahs, which is why we think pronghorns are so fast). And speaking of bears, did you know that up until around 9,000 BC there were several other bear species, including the North American giant short faced bear (Arctodus simus), the largest bear ever? When on all fours it was already six feet tall at the shoulder, and reached twelve feet tall when it stood on its hind legs, and weighed close to a ton. Its closest living relative is the South American spectacled bear. But enough about bears, let's talk about something a bit more controversial: whaling. Norway and Iceland both still practice commercial whaling, and Japan also practices large scale whaling, using the IWC scientific whaling permit as a loophole to the IWC moratorium on whaling, despite clearly hunting whales for commercial purposes. Indigenous communities around the world also hunt whales on a small scale. Of course, the issue of whaling is a complex one, with arguments on both sides. Some argue that whaling is an important part of certain cultures and traditions, while others argue that it's cruel and unnecessary. Regardless of where you stand on the issue, it's important to consider all perspectives and try to come to a balanced and informed opinion. And speaking of opinions, let's talk about the concept of being mixed race. As a mixed person myself, I can say that it's a complicated and often confusing experience. Depending on what you look like, people may identify you as one race or another, and it can be difficult to navigate the expectations and assumptions that come with those identities. Personally, I look like a lighter skinned black guy, so that's what most people identify me as. On official documents, I usually say that I'm both white and black. Hopefully it'll remain that way. But enough about me, let's talk about something a bit more lighthearted: Monty Python. Who doesn't love a good Monty Python reference? "We're Knights of the Round Table! We dance when er' we're able! We do routines and chorus scenes with footwork im-pec-cable! We dine well here in Camelot, we eat ham and jam and Spamalot! (Spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam...)" But let's get serious again for a moment and talk about the horrors of war. War is a terrible thing, and it's important to remember the human cost of conflict. Whether it's soldiers on the front lines or civilians caught in the crossfire, war has a devastating impact on everyone involved. And speaking of devastating impacts, let's talk about the concept of extinction. While some extinctions are natural and inevitable, others are caused by human activity and can be prevented. It's important to remember that every species has value and plays a role in the ecosystem, and that we have a responsibility to protect and preserve the natural world. But let's end on a more lighthearted note: coconuts. Did you know that there's actually a debate over whether or not coconuts can migrate? It's true! Some scientists believe that coconuts can float across oceans and establish new populations on distant islands, while others argue that this is unlikely due to the harsh conditions that coconuts would face during their journey. Regardless of whether or not coconuts can migrate, it's clear that they play an important role in many cultures and cuisines around the world. From coconut milk to coconut oil to coconut water, there's no denying that coconuts are a versatile and delicious ingredient. So there you have it, a meandering journey through a variety of topics, all tied together by the concept of circlejerks. Whether we're talking about language, bears, whaling, mixed race identity, Monty Python, war, extinction, or coconuts, it's important to remember that there's always more than one perspective to consider. By staying open-minded and engaging with different viewpoints, we can break out of the circlejerk and truly grow and learn.
