I came here to say this. The idea of conservatism and libertarianism being mutually exclusive is a fallacy. In fact, I consider myself to be both a conservative and a libertarian. The core belief of libertarianism is that everyone should be free to believe what they want, and this is something that many conservatives also believe in. However, the issue arises when it comes to activism and creating laws. As a conservative, I have my moral convictions, but I also believe that everyone should be free to do what they want, even if I disagree with their actions. For example, as a religious conservative, I am morally committed to traditional marriage as God designed it. However, I recognize that an earthly government has no true bearing on what marriage is, and therefore, the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage does not affect my personal beliefs. People are free to do what they want, and judgment comes afterwards. This applies to all the issues that fall under this category. I have my moral convictions, and others have theirs. If someone feels that their stance on a particular issue is 100% correct and should be enforced as such, they are actually less libertarian than I am because they are forcing their beliefs on others. The issue of borders is not clear-cut from a libertarian point of view. Property rights include the idea of borders, and some immigration issues can infringe on these principles. However, this does not mean that a conservative cannot be a true libertarian. The crux of the matter is the right action for people to take based on their religious beliefs, and my full-fledged allowance of them to do what I consider wrong. In other words, while I may consider someone's actions to be wrong and may even attempt to change their minds, as a libertarian, I fully understand and accept their right to do that thing. The problem with many laws today is that they lack common sense. Zero-tolerance rules are idiotic because no rule can be 100% applicable in all circumstances. There are potentially an infinite amount of special cases that can occur, and they require a thinking adult to discern the best course of action. Zero-tolerance rules basically preclude the use of common sense. It's standing behind your decision versus hiding behind "rules." There's a lack of personal responsibility when administration says "we're just following the rules" as a five-year-old gets pepper-sprayed or a 16-year-old girl gets her arm broken. The issue of civil rights and anti-trust laws is also relevant here. The civil rights act only overturned bad government laws in the first place. The same goes for anti-trust laws that came into place to break up railroad monopolies that were created by the government during the Great Depression. These laws were necessary to correct the mistakes of the government, but they should not be used to infringe on people's personal freedoms. The idea of personal responsibility is also important when it comes to labor laws. Labor, like any other commodity, is subject to supply and demand and other open market forces. If a company threatens to fire union members, they are jeopardizing their access to workers. The market will decide whether or not this is a good business decision. It's not the government's job to interfere in this process. The issue of trademarks is also relevant here. All companies with offensive trademarks are denied that trademark. However, this is not equal protection under the law. Comparing murderers to racist trademark owners and "everyone" to non-racist trademark owners is a false dichotomy. The analogy should be murderers=racist trademark owners and non-murders=non-racist trademark owners. This is a flaw in the application of equal protection. In conclusion, conservatism and libertarianism are not mutually exclusive. The core belief of libertarianism is that everyone should be free to believe what they want, and this is something that many conservatives also believe in. However, the issue arises when it comes to activism and creating laws. As a conservative, I have my moral convictions, but I also believe that everyone should be free to do what they want, even if I disagree with their actions. The problem with many laws today is that they lack common sense and personal responsibility. It's not the government's job to interfere in the market process, and equal protection under the law should be applied correctly.
