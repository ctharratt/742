When it comes to modeling, there are a few key things to keep in mind if you're only interested in the coefficient of one variable. First and foremost, you need to include confounders in your model. Confounders are variables that are related to both the variable of interest and the outcome, and failing to account for them can lead to biased estimates. Identifying confounders can be a complicated process, and it's important to consider whether there may be unmeasured confounders as well. One good place to start when it comes to identifying confounders is the Wikipedia page on confounding. This page provides a good overview of what confounding is and how to identify it, and it can be a helpful resource for anyone who is new to modeling. In addition to including confounders in your model, it's also important to include additional covariates that can increase the precision of your estimate for the variable of interest. If you don't care about the other variables in the model and won't be interpreting them or drawing any kind of inference from them, there's no reason not to include as many additional covariates as you can. This can help to make the confidence interval around the estimate of your variable of interest smaller, which can be helpful if you're trying to make more precise predictions. Of course, it's important to pay attention to the correlation between the additional covariates and your variable of interest, as well as to ensure that all of your assumptions are being met. But if you're careful and thoughtful in your modeling, including additional covariates can be a great way to improve the precision of your estimates. When it comes to preparing for a career in epidemiology, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First and foremost, it's important to have a strong foundation in math, statistics, biology, and medicine-related courses. These subjects will provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to be successful in the field, and they will help you to understand the complex relationships between different variables that are often at play in epidemiological research. In addition to taking STEM courses, it's also a good idea to consider writing an undergraduate thesis or project, as well as getting some work or internship experience. These experiences can help you to develop your skills and gain a better understanding of what it's like to work in the field of epidemiology. However, it's also important not to limit yourself too much to STEM coursework. Having a background in non-profit social service type work, for example, can be helpful in providing context and meaning to the work you're doing in epidemiology. And having a diverse range of experiences and perspectives can help you to approach problems in new and innovative ways. When it comes to software, there are a few different options to consider. SPSS is a popular choice for social science-related work, but it may not be the best option for epidemiology. Instead, it's important to know both R and SAS. SAS is often preferred by big institutions and government agencies, as it can handle large datasets well and automatically produces lots of diagnostics and easy-to-interpret plots and output. However, R is also a great option for many reasons. It's very flexible and can be used to create pipelines that turn a dataset into a full-fledged formatted report, update automatically if the data changes, publicly document your process on GitHub, write custom functions, produce beautiful visuals, scrape data from the web, create apps, and more. If you're interested in reproducible research, R is a great choice. If you're considering pursuing a graduate degree in epidemiology, there are a few different options to consider. An MSW may not be the best choice if you're primarily interested in epidemiology, as you can get ground-level experience without an MSW through nonprofit work or volunteering. Instead, an epi PhD may be a better fit for your goals. Ultimately, the most important thing when it comes to modeling and epidemiology is to be thoughtful and careful in your approach. By including confounders and additional covariates, taking STEM courses and gaining work experience, and using software like R and SAS, you can set yourself up for success in this exciting and important field.
