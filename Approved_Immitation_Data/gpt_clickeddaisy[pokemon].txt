Hey guys, just wanted to say that I'm really excited to check out that new game everyone's been talking about. But man, after all that Christmas shopping, I'm pretty burned out. Is there a way to get a physical copy of the game? And how can I have both versions at once? Also, when is it coming out in Europe? Okay, so I saw this picture of Whimsicott and I gotta say, that's not the Whimsicott I know and love. That thing looks like it came straight from the depths of hell. Whimsicott is supposed to be a happy-go-lucky cutie, not a demon spawn. Speaking of Pokemon, I never have any luck with wonder trading. But my friend is super lucky - she didn't even know it existed until I told her about it, and the first thing she gets is a freaking shiny Venonat. Meanwhile, I've got like four SPs, a Kyogre, a Groudon, and two generic gray ones. I recently started collecting Pokemon cards again and I gotta say, I'm really digging the style. Can someone draw me a super cute prankster Whimsicott? Also, my Bulbasaur is lost in the void - I restarted my Pokemon Blue game so many times that the original sticker is gone and now there's a Mudkip sticker on it. And can we talk about how awesome Arcanine is? It's my favorite Pokemon and I can't wait for the release. But I have a few questions - how long is the game gonna be? Will there be a choice of starters or is it set like in Yellow? If we get to choose, which Pokemon will they be? Is there gonna be a rival? And will there be optional randomizer and nuzlocke functions? Oh, and I gotta say, I learned a lot of English through gaming - mostly Pokemon and Legend of Zelda. It makes me sad when people associate games with violence and drug abuse. Like, come on guys, it's just a game.
