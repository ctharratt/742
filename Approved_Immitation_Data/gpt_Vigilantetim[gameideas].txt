I was thinking about making a game that captures the essence of college life. Something that's both mundane and absurd, just like college itself. I was inspired by games like Night in the Woods and Animal Crossing, where you can do everyday things but in a fun and interesting way. In this game, you would play as a college student navigating through their daily life. You would have to balance your academic responsibilities with your social life, just like in real life. But instead of just studying and going to class, you would have to find creative ways to do these things. For example, instead of just sitting in a library and studying, you could go to a coffee shop and study with friends. Or you could join a study group and make it a fun and collaborative experience. You could also attend lectures and events on campus to learn new things and meet new people. But college isn't just about academics. It's also about the social scene. In this game, you would have to navigate the nightlife of college, which can be both exciting and overwhelming. You would have to make choices about where to go and who to hang out with, all while trying to maintain a healthy balance. You could go to parties, join clubs, and attend events on campus. You could also explore the town or city where your college is located and discover new places to hang out. But you would also have to deal with the consequences of your choices, such as getting too drunk or missing a class because you stayed out too late. Another aspect of college life that I would like to include in this game is art. College is a time when many people discover their creative passions, whether it's music, writing, or visual art. In this game, you could explore your artistic side by attending art classes, joining a band, or writing for the school newspaper. You could also create your own art and share it with others, either through social media or by displaying it on campus. This would add a new dimension to the game and allow players to express themselves in a unique way. Overall, I think this game would be a fun and engaging way to capture the essence of college life. It would allow players to experience the ups and downs of college in a safe and controlled environment, while also providing opportunities for creativity and self-expression. I can almost imagine myself drawing it, with colorful and quirky characters and a vibrant campus setting. I think it would be a game that both college students and non-students could enjoy, as it captures the universal experience of growing up and finding your place in the world. Of course, there would be challenges in creating a game like this. It would require a lot of research and attention to detail to accurately capture the nuances of college life. It would also require a team of talented developers and designers to bring the game to life. But I think it would be worth it in the end, as this game has the potential to be both entertaining and educational. It could help people understand the complexities of college life and provide a fun and engaging way to explore this important time in our lives. In conclusion, I think a game about the mundane and absurdity of college would be a great addition to the gaming world. It would provide a unique and engaging experience for players, while also capturing the essence of college life in a fun and creative way. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game, and I hope that it will inspire others to explore the world of college in new and exciting ways.
