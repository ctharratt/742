Yo, what's up fellow TF2 players? I gotta say, I'm loving this game more and more every day. But there are a few things that have been bugging me lately, and I just gotta get them off my chest. First off, can we talk about the Pyro for a second? I mean, don't get me wrong, I love playing as the Pyro. But why does it seem like all the cool, scary cosmetics are for the Pyro? I wanna wear something that'll strike fear into the hearts of my enemies when I'm playing as the Spy. Imagine decloaking behind someone and the last thing they see is a terrifying mask staring back at them. That would be sick. Speaking of sick, have you guys seen the Hellstone map? It's so cool! I've been using it to rack up my uber and then hide, so when the other team pushes, they don't expect it. The only problem is that the "I AM FULLY CHARGED!" line kinda gives me away. But hey, it's all in good fun, right? I just wish there was a separate section on the Steam Community for these kinds of posts. Some people actually use the Artwork area for, you know, actual art. And while we're on the topic of Valve, can we talk about cross-platform play? I mean, TF2 was originally multi-platform, but Valve just kinda dumped support for that shortly after release. So when people start talking about cross-platform play, I'm a little skeptical. We'll have to wait and see how much support they actually give it. But let's not get too caught up in the serious stuff. Have you guys seen the new Buzz Cola ad? It's hilarious! And speaking of hilarious, have you seen the new TellTale Games poster? It's like the dickbutt of video games. And don't even get me started on John Cena. I know he does a lot of good charity work, but man, the sports entertainment community really hates him as a wrestler. Anyway, back to TF2. Have you guys ever had the problem where the item server is down for you but not for anyone else? It's the worst! I feel like I'm missing out on all the good stuff. And speaking of missing out, have you guys ever fallen for one of those teleporter traps on Sawmill? It's embarrassing, but I gotta admit, it's pretty clever. But let's end on a positive note. I gotta say, I love this game. I've put in over 1500 hours on pubs and Valve servers, and I'm still not tired of it. Sure, there are some frustrating moments, but overall, it's just so much fun. And the community is great too. I love being able to chat with other players and share tips and tricks. So here's to TF2, the game that never gets old. And here's to all of you, my fellow players. Keep on fragging!
