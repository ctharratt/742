Listen up, folks. It's time to face the harsh reality - the Republican party is a blight on our nation. They are nothing but a bunch of cowardly, moronic, fake Christian pieces of shit who let their love for god, guns, and gays destroy everything good about America. And it's time we all stand up and admit it. Let's start with the 2000 presidential election. We all know that Bush stole the election from Gore. The Supreme Court stopped the Florida recount, which Bush was 'ahead' by less than 500 votes. Turns out that if the recount would have continued (but why would ANYONE want an accurate tally?) Gore would have won. And don't even get me started on the butterfly ballots, hanging chads, and Washington conservative lobbyists 'protesting' in Dade County. It was all just proof of what scumbag pieces of shit Republicans are. And let's not forget about the voter ID laws that they push for. They claim it's to prevent voter fraud, but we all know the real reason - to stop minorities, young people, the elderly, and the poor from voting. They all had sufficient ID to register to vote, and they have that registration card. What more is necessary? Remember, there is virtually ZERO at poll voter fraud, so that argument doesn't fly. But it's not just the elections. Republicans are actively destroying our air, water, and earth. They don't care about the environment because they're too busy lining their pockets with money from big corporations. They tell women whether they will be forced to have a baby, they keep loving adults from marrying, and they practice state and corporate racism. And let's not forget about their obsession with guns - they use them to scare the cowards and the stupid. And don't even get me started on their attempts to take away healthcare from American citizens. They've voted almost 50 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which has helped millions of people get the healthcare they need. But the Republicans don't care about the people - they only care about their own interests. And let's talk about the Tea Party. They're a bunch of shit-eating, piss-drinking asshole morons who don't realize they're being bought and sold by the Koch Brothers. And the Republicans are so scared of them that they would prefer a right-wing racist over a communist that doesn't even exist. It's ridiculous. But it's not just the Tea Party. The entire Republican party is made up of filthy, indecent human beings. They let their love for god, gays, and guns destroy everything good about America. And anyone who perpetuates that is just as filthy and indecent. So let's stop pretending that the Republicans are anything other than what they are - a bunch of scumbags who are actively destroying our nation. It's time to stand up and fight back against their lies and their corruption. We can't let them win.
