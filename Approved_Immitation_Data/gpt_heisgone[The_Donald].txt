The current political climate in the United States is one of the most polarizing and divisive in recent memory. The 2016 presidential election was a prime example of this, with two candidates who were widely disliked by many Americans. On one hand, there was a Cruz-like ideologue who was seen as too extreme by many, and on the other hand, there was an Islam-loving feminist SJW who was seen as too liberal by many. It was a terrible choice, and it left many Americans feeling disillusioned and frustrated. One of the biggest issues that has been discussed during this election cycle is the relationship between the United States and Israel. Many candidates have expressed their support for Israel, but there are some who are seen as not being as pro-Israel as others. One of these candidates is Donald Trump. While he has expressed his support for Israel, there are some who believe that he is not as pro-Israel as other candidates. One of the reasons for this is that Israel wants Assad to go, and probably his whole regime to fall. Assad has assisted Hezbollah and is allied to Iran, and Israel considers those their worst enemies. Beside that, Trump hates the House Of Saud. It seems even personal because of 9/11. The House of Saud is friendly with Israel, and Israel knows that if the House of Saud was to fall, Sunni terrorism could become harder to deal with for them. Another issue that has been discussed during this election cycle is illegal immigration. Many candidates have expressed their views on this issue, but there are some who are seen as weak on illegal immigration. One of these candidates is Marco Rubio. He is Catholic and is seen as weak on illegal immigration. Trump could force Rubio to either admit he agrees with the Pope (as a good Catholic is expected to) or say he disagrees. Trump would win in both cases. One of the biggest issues that has been discussed during this election cycle is the bias in the media. Many people believe that the media is biased against certain candidates, and that they are not giving them a fair shake. This has been particularly true of CBS, which has been accused of being biased against Trump. Another issue that has been discussed during this election cycle is the use of social media. Many candidates have used social media to reach out to voters, but there are some who believe that social media is being used to bully and harass people. This has led to a new anti-bullying Twitter policy, which is designed to take care of this issue. One of the biggest issues that has been discussed during this election cycle is the role of religion in politics. Many candidates have expressed their views on this issue, but there are some who are seen as too religious. One of these candidates is Ben Carson. He is a devout Christian and has expressed his views on religion in politics. Many people believe that religion should not play a role in politics, and that candidates should be judged on their policies and their ability to lead. One of the biggest issues that has been discussed during this election cycle is the role of the government in people's lives. Many candidates have expressed their views on this issue, but there are some who are seen as too extreme. One of these candidates is Ted Cruz. He is a staunch conservative and has expressed his views on the role of the government in people's lives. Many people believe that the government should not be involved in people's lives, and that individuals should be free to make their own choices. One of the biggest issues that has been discussed during this election cycle is the role of the economy in people's lives. Many candidates have expressed their views on this issue, but there are some who are seen as too extreme. One of these candidates is Bernie Sanders. He is a socialist and has expressed his views on the role of the economy in people's lives. Many people believe that the government should play a larger role in the economy, and that individuals should have more access to resources and opportunities. In conclusion, the 2016 presidential election was a prime example of the polarizing and divisive political climate in the United States. Many candidates expressed their views on a wide range of issues, from the role of religion in politics to the role of the government in people's lives. While there were some candidates who were seen as too extreme, there were also some who were seen as too weak on certain issues. Ultimately, it was up to the voters to decide which candidate they believed was the best choice for the country.
