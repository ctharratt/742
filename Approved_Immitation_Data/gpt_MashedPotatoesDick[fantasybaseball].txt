As I sit here, scrolling through my fantasy baseball team, I can't help but wonder if I made the right choices. Did I draft the right players? Did I make the right trades? Will I be able to climb my way to the top of the standings? One player that has been on my mind lately is John Ryan Murphy. Did he pass his physical? Will he be the #1 catcher for the Twins? He's a name I may consider nominating first. A relatively unknown that may be obtained for $1. But then again, is he worth it? Will he produce the numbers I need to win? Speaking of trades, I remember when I initially drafted Dallas Keuchel in my final pick for $8. I traded him early on for Gardner and Samardzija. I flipped Samardzija and threw in Caño for Dee Gordon. Dee Gordon pretty much won it for my team. So thank you Dallas Keuchel. Thank you very much for the feedback. It's funny how some people spend big on certain players, only to finish low in the standings. Mike Trout went in the $50 range, but I had no players in the $40 range. My strategy was to pick up players early, middle, and late in the draft. Early: Paul Goldschmidt. Middle: Matt Duffy. Late: Billy Burns. It's all online, and while I was in charge of organizing, I don't know if that's worth tipping. But enough about the draft. Let's talk about the current state of my team. Sean Newcomb (LAA) may be worth grabbing. I was able to pick up Justin Bour, and I'm going to bench Adrián González and plug in Bour. González's pinch nerve has me worried and Bour has been decent. I looked at the upcoming pitching match ups for the Mets and noticed no Syndergaard. Is it 100% certain he is not getting a start? If that's the case, I will drop him and add a bat I may need last minute. And speaking of pitching, I would think Gott would be the logical choice to assume closer duties. I've heard it may be a groin injury like he had early in the season. Matt Shoemaker might be worth the add if available. He was sent down to the minors and then dominant in his first start back in the majors. I also snatched up Chris Bassitt from the A's. Only 2% ownership in Yahoo leagues, yet still has respectable numbers. But of course, not everything goes according to plan. I had McCullers and Koehler going tonight, only to be kicked in the balls right from the start. It's frustrating, but that's just how it goes sometimes. One thing that really grinds my gears is when managers don't reject or accept trades. Do something! It's been enough time that I will still keep the trade on the table. He may be in last place because he has terrible pitching and no consistent 1B. Sometimes you have to part with a nice prize to help your team out. If Upton wasn't involved, I would say it was collusion. Looks like I'll be swapping out Odorizzi and Matz on the DL spot. Can't I just have a healthy rotation?! And while we're on the topic of trades, I'm ready to offer my Brantley/Trumbo for his Adrián González/Revere. I may be biased, but I think it's fair. Who would get the better return? 14 team H2H R/H/HR/RBI/SB. Last week, my combined team put up a total of ZERO homeruns. In the 1st inning of the game against Guthrie, my Gardner and McCann both hit 3-run homeruns. Thank you Guthrie! Here's hoping Aaron Harang gives up more than two earned runs and less than five strikeouts tomorrow so I can tie for the week. But enough about my team. Let's talk about some other players that may be worth picking up. Is Forsythe a better bet to start over Trumbo? Mark Trumbo. He's putting up good numbers, but isn't getting the plate appearances I'd like to see from 1B. And what about trades? A trade of Michael Pineda for Stephen Vogt. Is it even or lopsided? Wins and innings pitched are good for my league. He has been one of my better under the radar picks. I tried with Rollins, but had to drop him. He has a shoulder problem. I'm not risking the chance of setting my lineup and him constantly getting a day of rest. With pitching, Samardzija was fighting for a fifth spot on my rotation which includes Scherzer, Cueto, Odorizzi, and Pineda. My fifth option as of now is Chris Young, Syndergaard, Bradley, DeSclafani or Sabathia. One of the reasons I like the league I'm in is because it's the first one I've been in with money on the line. I know the people are going to pay attention. I hate joining a league with strangers and then they quit caring after the draft. Even if you reject my trade, at least I know you saw it. But sometimes, it's not just about the players. It's about the league itself. Can I just say how much I hate playing in a league that locks up the lineup for the week on Monday? I've been screwed by this style of play. In the end, it all comes down to strategy. Do I load up on speed or focus on power hitters? Do I go for the big names or the underdogs? It's a constant battle, but that's what makes fantasy baseball so exciting. So as I sit here, scrolling through my team, I can't help but wonder if I made the right choices. But one thing is for sure: I'm in it to win it.
