Hey there fellow Monster Hunter fans! It's been a while since I've posted anything related to the game, but fear not, I'm still working on my comic. It's just moving a bit slow at the moment. I did base it off the rune for antekka though, so at least there's some progress being made. On a side note, I recently googled "gyftrot" and let me tell you, I'm not sleeping tonight. But hey, I get the feeling that Kim might be willing to part with hers. Maybe the commissioner wrote the wrong name? I just based it off a low Rez screen grab I was given. I thought it kind of resembled Seltas parts but I'm not really familiar with glaives. Either way, I ended up simplifying it to the point of no recognition. It was supposed to be an abounding Dalamadur, but I kind of struggled with the weapon's unusual shape and the dynamic angle. Currently, I'm playing 3U and trying to get dem plesioth heads! It's funny how the game has evolved over the years. I remember playing the very first Monster Hunter and falling for the classic noob trap of the Plesioth's hip check. It hit way harder than it does in 4 and his nose didn't flash in old MH. We almost triple carted, but it was a lesson learned. Anyway, enough about my gaming experiences. Let's talk about commissions! I'm currently out of freebie slots, but I do take commissions. It all depends on what you're looking for. Sketch, line art, basic color, detailed color? Let me know what you're looking for and we can figure out a price. Shoot me a message if you're interested in a commission. I accept payments through PayPal and we can figure out the price based on your request. For those of you who are interested in my work, I don't have an official site right now, but I do post all my work to my DeviantArt and Tumblr pages. I made a post a few weeks ago and took the requests of the first five people to post in the comments. Currently, I'm booked on freebies, but I do commissions too! As for the game itself, I'm currently playing through the older versions to catch up with the general MH public since I've been out of the game for a while. I've cleared every single player quest available to me and I believe I'm close to second G tier quests. It's been a journey, but I'm enjoying every moment of it. I remember when I first started playing Monster Hunter, it was one of those games that seemed really cool but I just couldn't figure it out. I bought it because my friend's explanation made it out to be awesome and he seemed to have no problem progressing in it, but I just couldn't figure it out. The first Kutku was the wall that made me quit Monster Hunter. I just couldn't figure out how I was supposed to fight it. I guess I was expecting it to have a lot less health and die quickly like the V drome. Fortunately, I wanted to like the game enough that I gave it another chance with Freedom on the PSP and playing with friends, it finally clicked! Speaking of the PSP version, it actually plays better than the original version with its auto-locking camera. I played about twenty hours of it and it was great. It's amazing how far the game has come since then. As for my comic, I'm still working on it when I can. It's taking way longer than I expected, but I'm determined to see it through. As of now, I plan on my character remaining a dedicated gunlancer once she reaches that point in the story. The same might not be said for the other characters. I like to pretend my characters have some dignity, so I'll dress them respectfully. In terms of weapons, there are multiple left-handed weapons in the game like sword and shield and charge blade. It's always nice to have options. One of my most memorable moments in the game was getting four carts in a single quest in Monster Hunter Freedom 1. There's a long cutscene before fighting Crimson Fatalis and you really don't realize that the cutscene is over until the moment the bastard swoops down and kills all of you instantaneously. It was a frustrating moment, but it's those kinds of challenges that make the game so rewarding. I recently watched a DLC video and I have to say, it looks good. I'm excited to see what new content they have in store for us. However, I strongly dislike hearing how other people pronounce Monster Hunter names. It's like nails on a chalkboard to me. Anyway, that's all for now. Thanks for reading and be sure to check out my DeviantArt and Tumblr pages for more of my work. And if you're interested in a commission, shoot me a message. Happy hunting!
