I have to say, I'm feeling pretty conflicted about the state of the Star Wars universe right now. On the one hand, I'm excited about the new movies and the direction they're taking the story. But on the other hand, I'm a little sad about all the canon material that's been tossed aside. I mean, I get it. The new movies need to be able to tell their own story without being bogged down by decades of existing material. But at the same time, it's hard not to feel a little betrayed by the fact that so much of what we thought we knew about the Star Wars universe is now considered "legends" rather than canon. Take the events of Knights of the Old Republic, for example. That game was a huge part of my childhood, and I always thought of it as an important part of the Star Wars story. But now, it's just another piece of "legends" material that may or may not have actually happened. And what about all the books and comics that have been published over the years? There are so many great stories in there, and it's a shame to think that they might never be considered "official" parts of the Star Wars universe again. But I guess that's just the way things go sometimes. The Star Wars universe is constantly evolving, and sometimes that means leaving old material behind in order to make room for new stories. One thing I am excited about, though, is the new Marvel Star Wars comics. I had no idea they were even a thing until recently, but now that I know about them, I can't wait to read them. I'm especially interested in the new Darth Vader series, which promises to explore the character in a way we've never seen before. And speaking of Darth Vader, I have to say that I'm a little disappointed that we won't be seeing more of him in the new movies. I mean, I get that he's dead and all, but he's such an iconic character that it's hard not to want more of him. But I suppose we'll just have to settle for Kylo Ren as our new villain. I have to admit, I'm not entirely sold on him yet. He seems a little too emo for my taste, but maybe he'll grow on me as the new movies come out. One thing I am excited about, though, is the possibility of seeing more of Maul in the new movies. I know it's a long shot, but I can't help but hope that he'll make an appearance at some point. He's such a cool character, and it would be a shame to see him go to waste. Of course, there are plenty of other characters I'd love to see more of as well. Plo Koon, for example, is one of my favorites, and it's a shame that we'll probably never get to see more of his story. But I suppose that's just the way things go. The Star Wars universe is a vast and ever-changing place, and sometimes we just have to accept that we won't get to see everything we want to see. All in all, I'm still excited about the future of Star Wars. Even though there are some things I'm sad to see go, I know that there are plenty of new stories and characters waiting to be discovered. And who knows? Maybe someday we'll even get that Knights of the Old Republic movie we've all been dreaming of.
