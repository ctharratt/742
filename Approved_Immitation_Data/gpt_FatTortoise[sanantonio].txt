Hey there! If you're planning a trip to San Antonio, I've got some tips and recommendations for you. But first, let me tell you about my experience with a certain program that ended up frying my AC system. A few years ago, I decided to opt for a program that promised to save me money on my energy bills. However, after just two months, the AC repair guys informed me that the program had caused coolant to enter the inside unit as a liquid and then go back to the outside unit as a gas. This caused problems when the system cycled on and off every 20 minutes or so, as the coolant was returning as a liquid and causing damage. I'm no expert on the subject, but I ended up having to take the thermostat off after a $10k central AC/Heat unit replacement. It was frustrating to say the least, and I couldn't help but feel like I had made a mistake by signing up for the program in the first place. But enough about that. Let's talk about San Antonio! If you're looking to experience the city's Hispanic roots, be sure to take a stroll through Market Square downtown. While it's mostly geared towards tourists, they sell a bunch of nicknacks and Mexican art that you might find interesting. And if you're feeling hungry, check out Mi Tierra, a popular Mexican food joint that's just around the corner from Market Square. It might be a bit touristy, but the food is still pretty good. If you're looking for something a bit more off the beaten path, I highly recommend checking out the Japanese Tea Garden, which is located across the street from the zoo. It's a beautiful spot that's definitely worth taking a gander at. And if you're into tattoos, be sure to check out Dandyland Tattoo on Bandera Rd. It's a top-notch shop that's been voted one of the best in the local SA current magazine year after year. For those of you who enjoy a good cocktail, be sure to check out The Brooklynite or The Last Word. Both are top-notch bars that are located downtown. And if you're more of a beer person, you might want to check out The Friendly Spot or Freetail Brewing. The Friendly Spot is located downtown, while Freetail is on the far outskirts of the city. If you're looking for some good food, be sure to check out The Pearl complex. There are lots of foodie options there if that's your thing. And while you're in the area, take a stroll along the "museum reach" of the river walk, which passes by the San Antonio Museum of Art and other outdoor art installations. Now, if you're looking for something a bit more adventurous, there are a few abandoned spots in the area that might pique your interest. For example, there's an old abandoned quarry/cement plant located at Wurzbach Parkway @ Thousand Oaks that looks pretty cool to explore. And if you're feeling really brave, you might want to check out the abandoned Longhorn Facility near Perrin Bitel. While I haven't checked it out myself, I've seen pictures that someone took while exploring it. The buildings are shells of what they used to be, so I'd imagine it's not operational anymore. But enough about abandoned buildings. Let's talk about something a bit more serious: violent crime. While it's true that the amount of media coverage violent crime receives has increased dramatically in recent years, that doesn't mean it's not a real problem. And while it's easy to sit back and claim that you're not part of the problem, the truth is that apathy such as this allows those with their own agenda to succeed. We all have a voice, and it's important that we use it to make a difference. Now, if you're looking for something a bit more lighthearted, there are plenty of fun things to do in San Antonio. For example, you might want to check out Chachos, a popular Tex-Mex joint that's known for its "chopped and dropped" fajitas. Just be sure to avoid any tattoo parlors that are attached to gas stations (like Integrity Tattoos), and don't get a tattoo from an artist named Rooster who promises to make it look "bad ass" when he's done. And if you're a fan of comic books, be sure to check out Alamo City Comic Con. While the first two events had their issues, the third one seemed to have addressed these problems and was a huge success. The layout was good, ticket purchases were handled efficiently, and everyone seemed to be having a great time. Finally, if you're looking for a way to give back to the community, consider becoming a volunteer ombudsman for the Bexar Area Agency on Aging. It's a great way to advocate for nursing home residents' rights and make a difference in the lives of others. So there you have it: my tips and recommendations for anyone planning a trip to San Antonio. Whether you're looking for adventure, good food, or just a fun time, there's something for everyone in this great city.
