I have to say, I'm a bit torn on the issue of revealing one's age on this subreddit. On the one hand, I can see how it might be helpful in giving feedback to know the age of the person who created the project. After all, different age groups might have different levels of experience with programming, and that could affect the kind of feedback they need. On the other hand, I can also see how revealing one's age could potentially be dangerous. As the mod pointed out, this subreddit is open to anyone, including minors, and revealing personal information like age could make them more vulnerable to online predators. Even if the information seems harmless on its own, it could be used in combination with other information to identify and target someone. So what's the solution? I think it comes down to a balance between transparency and safety. If someone feels comfortable revealing their age, that's fine, but they should be aware of the potential risks and take steps to protect themselves. For example, they could use a pseudonym instead of their real name, or avoid sharing other personal information like their location or school. At the same time, we as a community should be vigilant about protecting the privacy and safety of all members, especially minors. That means not pressuring anyone to reveal personal information they're not comfortable sharing, and reporting any instances of harassment or inappropriate behavior. Moving on to the projects themselves, I have to say I'm impressed by the variety and creativity on display. From platformers to space games to flying owls, there's something for everyone here. And the fact that they were all created using Scratch, a beginner-friendly programming language, is even more impressive. Of course, with any project there are bound to be bugs and glitches, and some of the commenters have pointed out a few. But overall, I think the projects are well-designed and fun to play. I particularly enjoyed the space game with its hand-drawn graphics and catchy music. One thing I did notice, though, is that some of the projects could benefit from more documentation. For example, the reaction game wasn't mentioned in the intro or project description, so I only found out about it by looking at the code. And in the platformer, it wasn't always clear what the objective was or how to progress to the next level. I think this is an area where the creators could improve, by providing more detailed instructions or tutorials for their projects. This would not only make it easier for others to play and enjoy their games, but also help them develop their skills as programmers by explaining the logic behind their code. Overall, I think this subreddit is a great resource for anyone interested in learning to code, regardless of their age or experience level. It's inspiring to see so many creative and talented individuals sharing their projects and helping each other improve. And as long as we continue to prioritize safety and respect for all members, I think it will continue to be a valuable community for years to come.
