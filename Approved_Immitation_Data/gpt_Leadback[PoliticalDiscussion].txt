The current state of American politics is a mess. The presidential campaign is off the rails with Trump leading the Republican party, and the Democrats are struggling to find a clear frontrunner. However, amidst all this chaos, one thing is clear: Israel is a major issue in American politics. The Republican party, in particular, has made it clear that they are staunch supporters of Israel. This is evident in the way that candidates like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have repeatedly namedropped Israel, even unprompted, and pledged their loyalty to the country. This kind of absurd praise is bizarre, especially considering that Rubio has openly admitted to loathing the Senate and has done nothing in his term representing Florida. But why is Israel such a big issue in American politics? The answer lies in the fact that the US has a strong security alliance with Israel, and many Americans view Israel as a key ally in the Middle East. Additionally, there is a strong pro-Israel lobby in the US, which wields significant influence over American politicians. However, the issue of Israel is not without controversy. Many Americans are critical of Israel's treatment of the Palestinians, and there is a growing movement to boycott Israel in protest of its policies. This has led to a divide within the Democratic party, with some members openly criticizing Israel and others staunchly defending it. The issue of Israel is also intertwined with American foreign policy in the Middle East. The US has been involved in numerous conflicts in the region, and Israel has often been a key player in these conflicts. This has led to tensions between the US and other countries in the region, particularly Iran. The Iran nuclear deal, which was signed in 2015, is a prime example of this. The deal was highly controversial, with many Republicans opposing it and many Democrats supporting it. The deal lifted economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for Iran agreeing to limit its nuclear program. However, many Republicans argued that the deal was a bad one, and that it would only embolden Iran and make the region less safe. The issue of Israel is also intertwined with American domestic politics. Many American Jews are strong supporters of Israel, and politicians who are seen as being pro-Israel often receive significant support from the Jewish community. Additionally, evangelical Christians, who make up a significant portion of the Republican base, are also strong supporters of Israel. However, the issue of Israel is not without its pitfalls.
