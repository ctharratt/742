Hey there! I just wanted to say that I'm so glad to hear that things worked out well for you! It's always great to hear about positive experiences. And I totally agree with your assessment of the local barber - it may not be perfect, but it definitely gets the job done. As for vegetarian food, I highly recommend Bogie's in Broad Ripple. They have some amazing options that even meat-eaters will love. And if you're ever looking to adopt a furry friend, the Mega Adoption events are a great place to start. All the animals there are just $30! In terms of photography, I think it's great that you own the copyright on your work. That gives you the power to choose how others use your photos. If you're interested in sharing them on the internet, I suggest choosing a Creative Commons license that allows for sharing with attribution. That way, you can still get recognition for your work while allowing others to use it. And speaking of sharing, if you have any photos of public art in the area, I'd love to see them! There's some great artwork around town, especially in places like College and 11th, 10th and Sherman, and Madison south of downtown. And if you're interested in checking out some shared workspaces, The Bureau in Fletcher Place is definitely worth a visit. I also wanted to address the issue of finding work. Have you considered looking into warehouse work or data entry? Those can be great options for people who prefer less personal interaction and lower stress levels. And if you're ever in need of resources, I work on a crisis line that may be able to help. Lastly, I want to say that I'm sorry to hear that you've encountered some negativity on this platform. Please know that there are still people here who are willing to help and support you. If you ever need anything, don't hesitate to reach out. We're happy to have you as part of our community!
