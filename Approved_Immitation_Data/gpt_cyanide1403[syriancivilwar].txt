The rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria has been a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, with many different factors contributing to its emergence and growth. One of the key factors that has been identified by analysts and experts is the role played by former members of Saddam Hussein's regime, particularly those who were part of the Baath Party and the military. During Saddam's rule, the Baath Party was the dominant political force in Iraq, and its members held many key positions in the government and military. However, after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Baath Party was disbanded and its members were banned from holding public office. Many former Baathists were also targeted by the new Iraqi government and the US military, which led to a significant amount of resentment and anger among this group. As a result, many former Baathists turned to insurgent groups such as Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), which was led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. AQI was a Sunni extremist group that was opposed to the US occupation of Iraq and sought to establish an Islamic state in the country. Many former Baathists saw AQI as a way to continue their fight against the US and the new Iraqi government, and they joined the group in large numbers. After Zarqawi was killed in a US airstrike in 2006, AQI was rebranded as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), and it continued to attract former Baathists to its ranks. Many of these former Baathists played key roles in the organization, particularly in the military and security apparatus. They brought with them valuable skills and experience, as well as a deep knowledge of the Iraqi state and society. One of the most prominent former Baathists to join ISI was Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, who was a close associate of Saddam Hussein and one of the most senior members of the Baath Party. Al-Douri was a key figure in the insurgency against the US and the new Iraqi government, and he played a significant role in the formation of ISI. After the death of ISI's leader, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, in 2010, al-Douri became one of the most important figures in the organization. Other former Baathists who joined ISI included Haji Bakr, who was a former intelligence officer under Saddam Hussein, and Samir Abd Muhammad al-Khlifawi, who was a former colonel in the Iraqi military. Both of these men played key roles in the organization, particularly in the areas of intelligence and military strategy. The presence of former Baathists in ISI was a significant factor in the group's success, particularly in the early years of its existence. These individuals brought with them a deep knowledge of the Iraqi state and society, as well as valuable skills and experience in areas such as military strategy, intelligence, and security. They also had extensive networks of contacts and supporters within Iraq, which helped the group to establish itself and gain support. However, the presence of former Baathists in ISI also had some negative consequences. Many Iraqis saw the group as a continuation of Saddam Hussein's regime, and they were wary of supporting it. In addition, the former Baathists within the group often clashed with the more ideologically driven members, particularly those who were affiliated with Al Qaeda. Despite these challenges, the former Baathists within ISI played a significant role in the group's rise to power. They helped to establish the group's military and security apparatus, and they provided valuable expertise and knowledge that allowed the group to operate effectively in Iraq. However, their presence also contributed to the group's negative image among many Iraqis, and it remains a controversial and divisive issue to this day.
