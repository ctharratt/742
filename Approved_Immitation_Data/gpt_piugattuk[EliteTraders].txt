I remember the time when I foolishly tried to take on a vulture and a wingman. I barely made it out with 27% of my haul left in my T9 with 4D shields. It cost me over 78 thousand credits to repair my ship. I know how it feels to be constantly attacked by the AI using vultures, pythons, and Anacondas. I think it's because I refuse to drop cargo to sidewinders and instead blow them up. The AI just wants me to die as a way to say FU for being successful at swatting flies. I don't mind losing jump range over having a ship full of hate for pirates, but we'll see. I need to make sure I can afford it though, maybe when I reach 200 million credits. I'm almost there now. I appreciate the excellent advice I received. I was actually thinking I should stop because of the mistakes I was making, but of course, you never think you're "that tipsy." Lucky for me, I normally don't drink anyway. And luckily, it's just a game that more than 2 hours of trade can fix. In real life, it's not so easy. As I said, I knew I should have stopped, but you never think it's not that bad. I had one, but unfortunately, I was departing and lifted off started forward, then a RL distraction. I thought I put myself (it was moving very slowly) into a hover, only to come back and see 1% left as it was tumbling against the entrance. I tried to grab the controls, but nope, I simply did not come back in time because my perception of time was off. Then when I realized, I ran back. I had resonating separators, but it was still a pretty good loss though. If you're looking for a good trading route, come to NJIKAN. The trading ports are NJIKAN to ROSS 199 or KAROVICES. These three systems do lots of trading. NJIKAN is hi-tech/refinery, ROSS 199 is industrial/extraction, and KAROVICES is industrial/extraction. They also offer a ton of missions, such as mission trade/mission slaves/mission messages, mission kill/mission drug running, and more. Any food missions go to Zomba. So say from Njikan, Smeaton port take land enrichment machinery to Zomba. From Zomba, get food for your missions. For missions involving minerals, go to ROSS 199. For metals, go to KAROVICES. For industrial such as clothing, go to Darudnikepa. For other hi-tech, fly to Andlit. So a small run for you can be Smeaton port take robotics to ROSS 199 Nicollet terminal. From Nicollet terminal, take gallite/bertrandite to KAROVICES Hurley terminal and pick up gold/beryllium/indium/gallium/silver, etc. and back to Smeaton port. Keep doing this, picking up missions for food, clothing, material, and if you're into it, you'll pick up tons of mining missions. Missions like this, a few of these, and credits roll in. Good luck. My ship's weapons are 3 large pulse lasers, 2 beam lasers, 3 A shield booster, and point defense. That's cool, but I just prefer feeling safer with MOAR power! :) You definitely learn a lot of new places to buy and sell, and as you do more business and get highly allied, the better the payouts, especially if you have a trade rank to tycoon. More boosts per second than that of a smaller power plant that has to fill a 10-gallon tank with a 5-gallon capacity, I suppose. I might be mistaken if this is the case. I was reading on galnet, then hearing a guy who does reviews on YouTube sounded like this was the case, but I guess no matter. We are going to find out one way or another. I looked at your build in the forum. Yes, max cargo but marginal safety. Is it likely to blow up in your face? Nah, but I just like having wider margins for safety. And to add, I like to see the NPC's go BOOM. Rare goods for you at this time will pay more. At 72 tons, that's not really going to pay out too well in comparison unless you find a trade route for common goods with only 1 jump and a return trip for drop off to the place of origin. However, if it's getting boring, then find a route and use missions to payout extra. Here's a route I use that pays well: NJIKAN to HS 7925. From Smeaton, take land enrichment machinery to Williamson port. From Williamson port, buy tobacco and fly over to the other station in the system (forgot the name, but there are only 2). From there, buy robotics and jump to ROSS 199 Nicollet terminal. From Nicollet terminal, buy bertrandite and jump to NJIKAN. Route complete. Don't forget to pick up missions from Njikan for food as you will be going to an agro station. Also, pick up anything going to ROSS 199 Nicollet terminal, then pick up missions from Nicollet terminal to NJIKAN. You will pick up missions for metals. Next door, KAROVICES Hurley terminal sells them, and that's excellent to sell to NJIKAN or ROSS 199. You should get that cargo up to 100 though. That is a noble sentiment, but the NPC's don't care. I wish it wasn't, but FD wants to make sure you have to work for your lunch. If you want to do it, go ahead, but eventually, you'll get sick of the repair bills as you keep getting interdictions. The issues you'd probably run into is that when you need to run or fight, you won't have enough juice to be effective. A 3A power plant feeding 5D thrusters and 6D PD is going to leave you underpowered, and the loss of jump range isn't really that bad if you go with 5D. My Asp that I fitted to be light is great, but the lack of available power to boost and fight stamina makes me feel dissatisfied. The only reason I will keep it as is is that I'm heading out and need the jump range to explore. Otherwise, I'd go with a more robust power plant. As a fellow trader, I sympathize with you guys. Here's how to deal with them (or at least has worked for me). If I am supercruising or just jumped into a system and I see the stupid pirate chatter in local saying something, throttle back and drop out of supercruise (when safe speed). Then wait or start going backward. 99% of the time, the pirate lands about 3km in front of you. In my case, I'm always fully armed and usually blow his ass up for some credits. Sometimes when the NPC pirate lands (especially in a viper), they boost and try to position themselves to attack from behind. As soon as they do that, you boost going forward. This puts lots of distance between you and it, and usually, you are ready to just supercruise away. When they follow you back to the station (and they will), bait them and let them start shooting. Then head towards the station, and you'll get a fourth of July show as the station opens up on their ass. Keep in mind of the system you're in. A lower-rated system equals more interdictions, but a high population highly policed system, you'll get interdicted less. Also, being fully armed lowers your chance (supposedly) of interdictions, but it also may have your combat rating as part of that "chance" encounter. I actually welcome the interdictions as a way to get some credits. Hope this helps. Also, just submit. It's pointless to fight it, especially close to the station. This way, you aren't carried far out. I did that in my Type 6 actually. You know, I've never hauled slaves, imperial or otherwise, even though the profit is great. I just cannot morally reason it out. Sure, I know it's a game and therefore not real, but it still bothers me. I was going to write the same thing, but you did it for me. There's only one station, a hi-tech station, so outfitting is easy. The only ships they don't offer are the diamondback explore, anaconda, and of course, courier and imperial cruiser. The only strange thing I found as far as fitting mods is there are no class 2 mining lasers, only class 1. However, next door, ROSS 199, they sell them there, so it's not such a big deal. In conclusion, trading can be a lucrative business, but it's not without its risks. You have to be prepared to defend yourself against pirates and other threats. It's also important to find good trading routes and to pick up missions to increase your profits. And remember, it's just a game, so have fun and don't take it too seriously.
