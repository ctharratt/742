Hey there, my fellow lupus warrior. I stumbled upon your post and I just had to reach out and say, I feel you. I really do. It's like we're part of this exclusive club that nobody wants to be a part of, but we're in it together nonetheless. I totally get what you mean about wanting a magic answer. It's like, why can't there just be a simple solution to this complex disease? But unfortunately, that's just not the case. Lupus is a tricky beast that affects everyone differently, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach to managing it. I'm sorry to hear that lupus has taken so much from you. It's not fair, and it's okay to be angry about it. But I'm also glad to hear that you've been able to turn things around and create a life that you're proud of. That takes a lot of strength and resilience, and you should be proud of yourself for that. I agree with you that life rewards those who fight and deserve it. It's not easy to live with a chronic illness, but we're still here, still fighting, still pushing forward. And that's something to be proud of. I also understand your desire to be independent and not rely on your family for care. It's a tough balance to strike, because on one hand, we want to be self-sufficient and not feel like a burden. But on the other hand, we also need to recognize when we need help and not be afraid to ask for it. It's a delicate dance, but one that we can learn to navigate with time. As for pain management, I hear you. It's not easy to find the right combination of medications that work for us, and it can be frustrating when we feel like we're not getting the relief we need. But I'm glad to hear that you've found some options that work for you. It's all about finding what works best for our individual bodies and needs. I also appreciate your thoughts on gene research. It's a complex issue, and I think it's important to consider all sides of the debate. While it's understandable to want to prevent passing on a potentially debilitating disease to future generations, it's also important to recognize that there are ethical concerns around genetic testing and the potential for discrimination based on genetic markers. And on a completely different note, I have to say, I love your sense of humor. Your comment about preferring a woman with two dicks up her ass to Miley Cyrus had me cracking up. It's important to find moments of levity and laughter in the midst of all the pain and frustration. Speaking of pain, I'm sorry to hear that you're still struggling with inflammation. It's not easy to manage, and it can be frustrating when we feel like we're not making progress. But I'm glad to hear that you've found some relief through dietary changes and luck. Sometimes it's the small victories that make all the difference. And finally, I just want to say that I hear you. I hear your pain, your frustration, your anger, your sadness. I hear it all, and I'm here for you. We may be part of a cursed bunch of spoonies, but we're also part of a community of warriors who refuse to give up. So keep fighting, my friend. Keep pushing forward. And know that you're not alone.
