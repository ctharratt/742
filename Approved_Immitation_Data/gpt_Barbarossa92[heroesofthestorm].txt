Hey there, fellow Heroes of the Storm enthusiasts! I just wanted to chime in on some of the recent discussions and ideas floating around the community. First off, can we all agree that Uther's mama jokes are getting out of hand? I mean, come on, we're better than that. Let's focus on the game and the heroes themselves. Speaking of heroes, I've been seeing a lot of talk about the Mind-Control ability and whether or not it should have a cooldown. Personally, I think it would be fair if it didn't have a cooldown, as long as it was balanced in other ways. After all, the ability is already quite strong as it is, and it's not the easiest thing to hit with as it is a skillshot that travels fairly slow. Now, let's talk about the recent addition of the Pandaren Brewmaster hero. I've seen some people suggesting that the three pandas should be split up, but I think that goes against the spirit of the hero. In Warcraft III, they always moved together as a unit, and it just wouldn't feel right to split them up. Plus, we already have heroes like The Lost Vikings and Rexxar who can control multiple units, so it's not like it's a completely new concept. I also wanted to address some of the feedback and suggestions for the Pandaren Brewmaster's abilities. Some people have suggested that the Flare ability should also remove mana, but I think that would make it too strong. Instead, I like the idea of it blinding enemies, which is a talent choice anyways. As for the Destroyer form, I think it would be better if the player didn't choose to go into it, but I'm not sure if having it trigger on death is the best solution. It could be very dangerous in certain situations. Moving on to another hero, I've seen some discussion about the Stone Giant hero and whether or not the name is fitting. Personally, I took the name from a list of known stone giants by name, but I'm open to suggestions for a better name if anyone has any ideas. Finally, I wanted to touch on the recent changes to Kael'thas. I've watched a lot of games where he's been picked, and I have to agree with some of the other players who have said that he doesn't seem to have as much impact as Jaina. He's definitely squishy, which is to be expected, but it feels like he's missing something. Maybe it's just a matter of finding the right build or playstyle, but I think he could use a little something extra to make him more viable. Overall, I'm really enjoying the discussions and ideas that are being shared in the community. It's great to see so many passionate players coming together to share their thoughts and suggestions. Keep it up, everyone! And let's try to keep the mama jokes to a minimum, okay?
